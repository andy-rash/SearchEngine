      <text xml:space="preserve">Start the fire first with tinder, then add small twigs (wire size), then pencil size twigs, then thumb size twigs.  Keep the fire small so that you aren't wasting valuable energy gathering firewood all the time. However if gathering wood is easy big fires attract attention. Burn whole logs without cutting them by just sliding them into the fire as they burn (the whole log will not catch fire).

Don't fear rain. Rainwater is just on the outside, and this does not mean that wood is sodden through. Green wood and young branches are &quot;wet,&quot; and won't ignite readily, but any kind of wood will eventually burn on a hot enough fire. If it looks like a heavy downpour is coming, build a roof over your fire using one or two big logs about a foot (30cm) above the coals.

* Paper, cardboard, or unneeded cloth can be easy to start on fire
* Use small twigs from under the main canopy of the tree as tinder. (If they don't break off easily, they are still green.)
* Dry pine needles work great to start fires and give off lots of smoke.
* Rubbing bark between your hands until it is fluffy also makes excellent tinder
* Cattails easily catch on fire.
* If stranded in a vehicle, siphon out some gas or oil.

If you don't have matches:

* The old &quot;fire-bow&quot; trick is very hard work even under the best circumstances
* Fire can be started with a glass lens from a magnifying glass, mirror, binoculars, and the polished bottom of a soda can. (Most eyeglasses will not work.)
* The reflector of a (broken) car headlight can be used to concentrate sunlight and start a fire. Place tinder where the filament is and point the lamp at the sun. Same with a flashlight reflector.
* Flint and steel works but you must practice with it first.

Lately many new products have become available:

* Two-part chemical fire starters work fairly well and work even in the rain
* Magnesium fire starters work well but practice with them first

Some other ideas

* a tealight candle works wonders.
*If you have a 9 volt battery and a bit of steel wool, hold the steel wool against the battery's terminals and it will spark and start the steel wool burning.
* Just for fun ( be careful with frost bite for this one) but you can actually start a fire by melting a piece of ice with your hands into a lens and using it to start a fire. However Mythbusters showed this does not work.
* Be creative

To coax a struggling fire into a healthy blaze, fan it or blow on the coals. A flap of cardboard makes an ideal fan. Be careful not to blow it out.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:1.5em;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
Mullah, Nasrudin Hoja appears as the whimsical character in a growing tradition of stories. The tales of Nasrudin are sometimes adapted and used as teaching stories by followers of the Sufi way. Some mystic traditions use jokes, stories and poetry to express certain ideas, allowing the bypassing of the normal discriminative thought patterns. The rationality that confines and objectifies the thinking process is the opposite to the intuitive, gestalt mentality that the mystic is attempting to engage, enter and retain.

By developing a series of impacts that reinforce certain key ideas, the rational mind is occupied with a surface meaning whilst other concepts are introduced. Thus paradox, unexpectedness, and alternatives to convention are all expressed in the humor of Nasrudin.

Please add to the tales of Nasrudin and interpretations. It is said, there are as many interpretations as stars in the sky. And when you read a story, see yourself reflected in the story and make your own interpretations rather than relying on others to tell you the meaning of the story. In this way, you will learn for yourself and the usefulness of the story's teaching will be deeper.

== The Eternal Comedian ==
It is sometimes said that the Universe is Allah laughing himself into existence. The idea of the cosmic joker that begins within a broadening smile allows us to hear the profound in the profane and the profane in the sanctimonious. Keep smiling.

The use of humor, stories and puzzles is well developed in shamanistic and pagan cultures. The mischievous spirit is both tension releasing and realizing of the solutions to life situations. Nasrudin Hodja belongs to this rich tradition stretching back into pre literate society. Humor brings insight and understanding and is a release of stored energy; clearing in nature.

: &quot;If you want
: special illumination,
: look upon a human face:
: see deeply,
: within laughter,
: the essence
: of ultimate
: truth...&quot;

''Mevlana Jallaludin Rumi''

== Sufism ==
An opinion lessening form of Islamic heresy that stresses poetry and reasonable tolerance of peoples differences. Values inner quality above external piety. Nasrudin is often regarded as an 'Idiot', one of the appellations dervishes use in describing their Divine Madness. He also represents the excesses of the clerical or literal mind.

== The Helper of Religion ==
There has to be more than just humor to make it a Nasreddin tale. It
depends on the area from where the modern tales come. Tales originating
in China will show a Nasreddin  which has as extra element that he is
campaigning for the oppressed, bullying rulers and those who abuse their
authority. See &quot;The Effendi And The Pregnant Pot - Uygur Tales from
China&quot;; New World Press; Beijing, China. &quot;The Enchanted Prince&quot; by
Leonid Solovyov is a novel about Nasreddin wherin he is a flagrant
subverter, a thorn in the side of the powers that be, a disturber of the
peace.Ulrich Marzolph in his Nasreddin Hodscha presents no less than 666
true Nasreddin tales (although Nasreddin claims never to have spoken the
truth) and does so in a chronological order, even showing erotical
adventures of our hero. Sufi teachers are at times coining modern
Nasreddin tales in order to further their teaching, as the opening
sentence &quot;One day Mulla Nasreddin...&quot; is sufficient for many audiences
to lower their barriers.

Nasruddin tales are from many ages and many cultures. There are 
Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Berber, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Daghestani,
Greek, Judeo-Arabic, Kurdish, Maltese, Mandaic, Macedonian, Persian,
Serbian, Sicilian, Syrian, Tajik, Turkish, Uighur and Uzbek sources
for Nasruddin tales. He is known as Nasreddin, Joha, Si Je'ha, Giufa,
Ieha, Iugale, Gahan, Nastradin, Nastradi, Hojas, Jiha, Juha, Khodja, Mala,
Apendi, Afandi, Effendi, Afanti

== Audience with the King ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Nasrudin returned to his village from the imperial capital, and the villagers gathered around to hear what had passed.  &quot;At this time,&quot; said Nasrudin, &quot;I only want to say that the King spoke to me.&quot;  All the villagers but the stupidest ran off to spread the wonderful news.  The remaining villager asked, &quot;What did the King say to you?&quot;  &quot;What he said -- and quite distinctly, for everyone to hear -- was 'Get out of my way!'&quot; The simpleton was overjoyed; he had heard words actually spoken by the King, and seen the very man they were spoken to.
}}

== Timur's Gift I ==
{{wikipedia|Timur}}
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Timur's armies were plundering the entire Central Asia and the rumors were that Timur was heading for Mullah's village. Hearing this, Mullah in his Friday sermon called for a collective prayer.  &quot;Let us all pray for the death of Timur the Lame before he comes&quot;. All villagers said Amen loudly.

A man stood up from among the worshipers and asked, &quot;Have you ever seen Timur?&quot;.

Mullah replied, &quot;No, and I have not seen you before either&quot;.

The man said, &quot;You are right, because I am Timur&quot;.

Mullah was stunned by the news, and so were all the villagers.  Mullah calmly resumed his sermon.  &quot;Let us pray once more collectively, this time our Janazah (funeral prayer)&quot;.

&quot;How can you pray your own Janazah you fool&quot;, asked Timur, &quot;Janazah is prayed by the living on the dead&quot;.

&quot;Yes my lord but you see&quot; replied Mullah &quot;We are all about to be dead with no one to pray Janazah on us.  So we have to take care of our Janazah ourselves&quot;.

Timur laughed his heart out and pardoned Mullah and gave an elephant as his gift to the village.
}}

* Humor can speak to even the hardest of hearts.

== Timur's Gift II ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
The villagers soon discovered that the elephant ate a lot of their crop and was of no use.  However they could not kill or sell the gift of Timur out of fear of his wrath.  They all blamed Mullah and demanded he returned the gift.

Mullah agreed but on one condition that all villagers should accompany him.  Mullah went to the tent of Timur.  Timur was in a bad mood and shouted on Mullah as he saw him.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;It is about the elephant you gave&quot;.  Mullah replied.

&quot;What about the elephant?  Is my gift no good to you?&quot;  Timur asked.

Mullah turned and found no villagers behind him. Angry and feeling cheated, Mullah thought of a way out and a revenge with the villagers at the same time.

&quot;Oh it is good alright, my lord&quot; Mullah said, &quot;It is just that he is all alone and feels sad.  I was wondering if you can provide him with the company of a female elephant&quot;.
}}

* Always keep your word

==The Book==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
While on a trip to another village, Nasrudin lost his favorite copy of the mystical book.

Several weeks later, a goat walked up to Nasrudin, carrying the book in its mouth.

Nasrudin couldn't believe his eyes.  He took the precious book out of the goat's mouth, raised his eyes heavenward and exclaimed, &quot;It's a miracle!&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; said the goat.  &quot;Your name is written inside the cover.&quot;
}}

* Be wary of stories from exaggerators.
* Label your possessions!

== The Guest of Honor ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
The dervish Nasrudin entered a formal reception area and seated himself
at the foremost elegant chair. The Chief of the Guard approached and
said: &quot;Sir, those places are reserved for guests of honor.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I am more than a mere guest,&quot; replied Nasrudin confidently.

&quot;Oh, so are you a diplomat?&quot;

&quot;Far more than that!&quot;

&quot;Really?  So you are a minister, perhaps?&quot;

&quot;No, bigger than that too.&quot;

&quot;Oho!  So you must be the King himself, sir,&quot; said the Chief sarcastically.

&quot;Higher than that!&quot;

&quot;What?! Are you higher than the King?!  Nobody is higher than the King in this village!&quot;

&quot;Now you have it.  I am nobody!&quot; said Nasrudin.
}}
* Nobody is greater than God.
* One should show regard for those of humble means.
* Even a person of no consequence can be Hodja.
* Elevation comes through the abandonment of ego.
* Beware of the clever tongue.

== Face of the Devil ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
When Timur was visiting the town, he called upon the local celebrity, Mulla Nasrudin.

&quot;They say you are a man of much knowledge, a man who is in league with the forces of darkness, that you have strange powers and know the strangest incantations, in fact they say you are in direct correspondence with Satan himself!&quot;
&quot;That is what they say!&quot;  Nasrudin nodded, much amused.
&quot;Tell me then, if you value your life,&quot; roared Timur, a little irritated by Nasrudin's demeanor, &quot;what does this Devil actually look like?&quot;

&quot;Why certainly Your Majesty,&quot; smiled Nasrudin presenting him with a mirror, &quot;here, take a look for yourself!&quot;
}}

* Nasrudin shows that the Devil is in us when we are angry. Timur's anger is where the Devil comes out.
* Judge not that ye may not also be judged.
* To teach anyone is correspondence with the Devil.
* It is all about your disposition: You are/become what you desire.
* Don't ask questions unless you want to know the answers.

==Of any two options choose the third==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
A judge in a village court had gone on vacation. Nasrudin was asked to be temporary judge for a day. Nasrudin sat on the Judge's chair with a serious face, gazing around the public and ordered the first case be brought-up for hearing. 

&quot;You are right,&quot; said Nasrudin after hearing one side.

&quot;You are right,&quot; he said after hearing the other side.

&quot;But both cannot be right,&quot; said a member of public sitting in the audience.

&quot;You are right, too&quot; said Nasrudin.
}}

* Conflict is a natural state of affairs - it's okay to accept this. 
* Resolving disputes is not about who believes they are right.
* Remember, always consider there might be external or unknown factors 
* Truth, correctness, and integrity are subjective. 
** Judgment doubly so.
* Expecting the world to make perfect sense might not make sense.
* Even judges can be fools.

==A call to prayer==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Mullah Nasruddin frequented a local [[wikipedia:Hamam|hamam]] which had a large dome with an acoustic very flattering to the voice, and he would often spend long hours singing in the bath, delighting in the sound of his own voice.

When one day, Mullah Nasruddin had no [[wikipedia:muezzin|muezzin]] to call the faithful to prayer, he decided that he was a sufficiently good singer to take on this sacred duty.

By that day’s second call to prayer, the faithful gathered under the minaret and began to shout Nasruddin down for the terrible noise he made.

“Don’t blame me for the din,&quot; replied the Mullah, &quot;they didn’t install a bathroom up here yet!”
}}

* It is easier to deflect blame outside of yourself than to accept it.
* It's hard to judge your own voice, just as it's hard to judge your own actions. Listen to those around you who care enough to criticise you.
* Context is everything.
* His singing may have been awful, but at least it worked!

==Ignore the Braying==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
A neighbor comes to Nasreddin Hoja. 

&quot;Would you lend me your donkey today, Hoja?&quot; the neighbor asks, &quot;I have goods to transport to the next town.&quot;

The Hoja answers: &quot;I'm sorry, but I've already lent her to somebody else.&quot;

Suddenly the donkey is heard braying loudly behind a wall.

&quot;You lied to me, Hoja!&quot; the neighbor exclaims, &quot;There is the donkey!&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the Hoja replies indignantly, &quot;Whom would you rather believe, a donkey or your Hoja?&quot;
}}

* The truth can come from unexpected places.
* Don't lie about your affairs. The truth comes out eventually.
* Claims of religious authority is the first refuge of the scoundrel. Be wary of liars who lead.

==Fishy Morality==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Once a renowned philosopher and moralist was traveling through Nasruddin's village and asked Nasruddin where there was a good place to eat. Nasruddin suggested a place and the scholar, hungry for conversation, invited Mullah Nasruddin to join him. Much obliged, Mullah Nasruddin accompanied the scholar to a nearby restaurant, where they asked the waiter about the special of the day. 

&quot;Fish! Fresh Fish!&quot; replied the waiter.

&quot;Bring us two,&quot; they requested.

A few minutes later, the waiter brought out a large platter with two cooked fish on it, one of which was quite a bit smaller than the other. Without hesitating, Mullah Nasruddin took the larger of the fish and put in on his plate. The scholar, giving Mullah Nasruddin a look of intense disbelief, proceed to tell him that what he did was not only flagrantly selfish, but that it violated the principles of almost every known moral, religious, and ethical system. Mullah Nasruddin listened to the philosopher's extempore lecture patiently, and when he had finally exhausted his resources, Mullah Nasruddin said,

&quot;Well, Sir, what would you have done?&quot;

&quot;I, being a conscientious human, would have taken the smaller fish for myself.&quot; said the scholar.

&quot;And here you are,&quot; Mullah Nasrudin said, and placed the smaller fish on the gentleman's plate.
}}
* Philosophizing is useless.
* Moral conduct is ultimately selfish.
* Kindness and wisdom expressed through customs and tradition often lose their meaning, and their intent. 
* Being mindful is not about philosophy.
* The noblest philosophy and erudition can be used for selfish ends.
* For the innovative, there always exists a perspective in which &quot;doing unto others as you'd do unto yourself&quot; pays off.

== The Right Route ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Nasrudin is asked by an official passing through:

&quot;How do I get to town?&quot;

&quot;Go to the village,&quot; suggests Nasrudin.

&quot;The village is in the wrong direction. I have just come from there; I want to go to town,&quot; says the haughty official.

&quot;You can't get to town from here,&quot; insisted Nasrudin.

&quot;Town is straight ahead, is that right?&quot; argues the official. 

&quot;That's right!&quot; says Nasrudin.

&quot;And you would go straight ahead to get to town, right?&quot;

&quot;Right again!&quot;

&quot;Then why are you advising me to go back to the village?&quot; asks the triumphant official.

&quot;Well Sir, you see, they have something you need, a signposted route to town - I know where I am going!&quot;
}}

* Don't leave town without directions.
* If you do, then you might get turned around.
* People in need of favors should watch their manners.
* Why ask, if you seem to know better?

== Wearing other people's hat ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
&quot;Nasrudin, why is it people laugh at you?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Nasrudin, &quot;Think of me as a turban. The nature of laughter exposes the false. If people laughed at themselves they would feel naked. Therefore I provide them with a 'head covering'.&quot;

&quot;But Nasrudin, they are still naked!&quot;

&quot;Shhhhh,&quot; said Nasrudin smiling . . .
}}

* People need a teacher to help them learn more about themselves.
* It is not only the Emperor who has no clothes.
* If people are unable to laugh at themselves in order to learn, they can laugh at him instead and learn that way.

== Wisdom from the Hidden Realms ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Two children found a bag containing twelve marbles. They argued over how to divide the toys and finally went to see the Mulla. When asked to settle their disagreement, the Mulla asked whether the children wanted him to divide the marbles as a human would or as Allah would.

The children replied, &quot;We want it to be fair. Divide the marbles as Allah would.&quot;

So, the Mulla counted out the marbles and gave three to one child and nine to the other.
}}

* What Allah sees as fair and what men see as fair is not necessarily one and the same.
* Accept what you receive.
* Do not compare yourself to others in terms of what is fair.
* Life is not equally fair to everyone. Nor are humans equal to each other.
* We don't always understand the bigger picture, so we should accept what life gives us.
* Being fair - is a human concept and not something Allah made

== Last Wishes ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Nasrudin is with his cronies drinking coffee:

They are discussing death, &quot;When you are in your casket and friends and family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say about you?&quot;

The first crony says, &quot;I would like to hear them say that I was a great doctor of my time, and a great family man.&quot;

The second says, &quot; I would like to hear that I was a wonderful husband and school teacher which made a huge difference in our children of tomorrow.&quot;

Nasrudin says, &quot; I would like to hear them say... LOOK!! HE'S MOVING!!!&quot;
}}

* Never give up hope.
* Dead men cannot hear.
* Be sure you understand the question before you choose your answer.
* Pay attention only to the '''real''' issue.
* The best last wish is, that these wishes won''t be the last.
* Die before you die.

== Certainty ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
&quot;Let us toss a coin and see who is right?&quot;

&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Nasrudin, &quot;heads I win, tails you lose.&quot;
}}

* Smooth talkers get their way.
* Sometimes, you just can't win.
* Coins don't know who's right.
* Make your own luck.

== Orthodoxy and heresy ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
&quot;Nasrudin, is your religion orthodox?&quot;

&quot;It all depends,&quot; said Nasrudin, &quot;on which bunch of heretics is in power.&quot;
}}

* Power is not the arbiter of truth.
* Heresy and orthodoxy are worldly distinctions.
* Religious definitions are more often politics than spirituality.

== The Nature of the Unseen ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
It seems that the Master of Mirth and Chief of the Dervishes, Nasrudin, was once called to pontificate on the 'Nature of Allah' in the local mosque. Present were the many Imams and Doctors of the Islamic Law. Out of courtesy and because Nasrudin could not be counted on saying anything worthwhile, these illustrious guests explained and inspired the audience with their eloquence and wisdom.

Finally it was Nasrudin's turn to explain 'the Nature of Allah'.

&quot;Allah ...&quot;, started Nasrudin impressively &quot;is ...&quot;

Nasrudin removed and held up an ovoid mauve vegetable from the folds of his turban, &quot; ... an [[w:Eggplant|aubergine]].&quot;

There was uproar at this blasphemy. When order was finally established, Nasrudin was reluctantly asked to explain his words.

&quot;I conclude that everyone has spoken of what they do not know or have not seen. We can all see this aubergine. Is there anyone who can deny that Allah is manifest in all things?&quot; 

Nobody could.

&quot;Very well,&quot; said Nasrudin, &quot;Allah is an aubergine.&quot;
}}

* Don't talk about things you don't know about.
* A fool can make a fool of learned men.
* The wisdom of the lord is the folly of men, and the folly of men is the wisdom of the lord.
* People know as much about god as a chick that is still inside the egg.
* Wise men can be trumped by a vegetable.
* Religious people do not really believe the things they say and think they believe.
* No description is equivalent to the thing it describes. To do so it would have to be the thing itself. Therefore, one can demonstrate but not describe the nature of Allah.
* If we truly want to believe in and appreciate God, we should cherish him in all things, thus making our belief in him real.
* Just because someone is making noise does not mean that they are communicating.
* The nature of Allah is beyond human comprehension.
* It makes no difference what Allah is.

== Who died? ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
A traveler was passing through town when he came upon a huge funeral procession. Nasrudin was on a corner watching the people pass by.

&quot;Who died?&quot; the traveler asked Nasrudin.

&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; replied Nasrudin, &quot;but I think it's the one in the coffin.&quot;
}}

* Language is imprecise and we can sometimes miss the context of a question.
* Speak only the truth you know.
* Once somebody is dead, it matters little who they were in life.
* Being a traveler, he wouldn't have recognized the person who died anyway.  Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.
* We could answer many of our own questions, with a little thought.

== Fishing... ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Nasrudin heard that the king sent out a committee incognito, seeking suitable candidates for qazis (judges). Nasrudin took to walking around carrying an old fishing net on his shoulder. When the members of the committee reached his village, it drew their attention and they questioned him about it. 

&quot;Oh, I carry this net with me to remind me of my humble past as a poor fisherman,&quot; explained Nasrudin. The committee was impressed, and in due time Nasrudin was nominated as a qazi.

Shortly afterwards those king's representatives met Nasrudin again and noticed the net was gone. 

&quot;Where is the net, Nasrudin?&quot; they asked. 

&quot;Well, you don't need the net after the fish is caught, do you?&quot; replied Nasrudin.
}}

* Fools remain fools although power is with them.
* Only Intelligence can win over power.
* Power is founded on lies.
* There is no reason to carry on with a deception after it has served its purpose.
* Don't set in authority over you those who will lie to achieve such positions.
* People tend to elect officials for foolish reasons. Image over substance.
* Wisdom given may not mean what you expect it to mean, and the truth may be unflattering.
* Be unique.

== Return of the Camel ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
&quot;Thief, thief! Someone has stolen my camel!&quot; cried Nasrudin.
Finally after the commotion was quietened someone observed, &quot;But Nasrudin, you have no camel.&quot;
&quot;Shhh...&quot; said Nasrudin, &quot;I am hoping the thief is unaware of this and the camel will be returned.&quot;
}}
* Not all who claim to have been wronged, truly have been.
* Beware those who play on your sympathies, sometimes they do so for the wrong reasons.
* Sometimes, the true thief is the one claiming to have been stolen from.
* There is no thief and no camel to be returned. Things you make up don't become reality.

== People's talk ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Mulla Nasrudin and his son were riding the donkey to the town market. A group of people passed. Mulla heard them whisper: &quot;What times are these? Look at those two, have they no mercy on the poor animal?&quot;

Nasrudin, hearing this, tells his son to get off and continue the journey on foot. Another group of people passing by and seeing this comment: &quot;What times are these? Look at this man. His poor son with his frail body has to walk while he at his best age is riding the donkey!&quot;

Hearing this, Nasrudin tells his son to ride the donkey and he himself gets off to walk the rest of the way. A third group of people seeing this remark: &quot;What times are these? This young man is riding the donkey while his sickly old father has to walk!&quot;

Hearing this, Nasrudin tells his son to get off the animal and they both walk with the donkey trailing behind. Another group passing by point to them, laughing: &quot;Look at these idiots. They have a donkey and they are walking all the way to the market!&quot;
}}


* It is impossible to please everyone.
*

== Preaching ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Mulla preached on Fridays at the village mosque. One day, having nothing to preach about, he asked the congregation:
&quot;Do you know the subject I am going to discuss today?&quot;
&quot;No&quot; said the people.
&quot;Then I refuse to preach to such an ignorant assembly. How could you not know given the events of the past week?&quot; asked Mulla and left hurriedly.
Next Friday he went up the minbar and asked: &quot;Do you know the subject of my sermon today?&quot;
People fearing a repetition of what had taken place a week before nodded and said: &quot;Yes yes, indeed we know.&quot;
&quot;Well, then. There is no point in telling you what you already know&quot;, said Mulla and left.
On the third Friday he ascended the minbar and asked: &quot;Do you know what I am going to speak about today?&quot;
&quot;Some of us know and some do not,&quot; answered the prepared congregation.
&quot;Excellent, then those who know can tell those who don't&quot;, said Mulla and left.
}}

* It is easy to manipulate an audience that trusts you implicitly.
* The correct answer is not always the opposite of the wrong answer.
* It is impossible to teach those who are completely ignorant, and it is impossible to teach those who believe they already know the answers. The real way toward wisdom is for the learned ones to pass on what they know to ones who are willing and able to learn.

== Ageless Strength ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
:Mulla was once boasting about his ageless strength.
&quot;I am as strong as I was when I was a young man.&quot;
&quot;How can that be?&quot; asked people.
&quot;There is a big rock outside my house. I couldn't move it then and I can't move it now!&quot; said Mulla.
}}

* It's all relative.
* One must carefully choose the standards one measures oneself by. If the standard is too high it will never be achieved.
* All of life's woes come from comparison.
* The limitations of the self to effect the physical world remain relatively stable regardless of age or status.


== The Great Pumpkin ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
Nasreddin Hodja was lying in the shade of an ancient walnut tree. His body was at rest, but, befitting his calling as an imam, his mind did not relax. Looking up into the mighty tree he considered the greatness and wisdom of Allah.

&quot;Allah is great and Allah is good,&quot; said the Hodja, &quot;but was it indeed wise that such a great tree as this be created to bear only tiny walnuts as fruit? Behold the stout stem and strong limbs. They could easily carry the great pumpkins that grow from spindly vines in yonder field, vines that cannot begin to bear the weight of their own fruit. Should not walnuts grow on weakly vines and pumpkins on sturdy trees?&quot;

So thinking, the Hodja dozed off, only to be awakened by a walnut that fell from the tree, striking him on his forehead.

&quot;Allah be praised!&quot; he exclaimed, seeing what had happened. &quot;If that had been a pumpkin that fell on my head, it would have killed me for sure! God is merciful! He has rearranged nature only to spare my life.&quot;
}}

* Things are as they should be.
* Man is unable to understand just how complex nature actually is.
* To achieve the fruit (spiritual perfection) one needs to be humble as the big fruit grow on the vines which are on the ground. Tall trees cannot bear the weight of big fruit and hence only produce walnuts.
* What we think should be best, and what really is best, are often very different things.
* To compare what is and what should be is always a fallacy, as it oversimplifies that which we, as mortals, cannot understand.

== Truth ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
One day a fool asked Nasrudin &quot;is God true?&quot;

&quot;Everything is true&quot; replied Nasrudin.

&quot;Even false things?&quot;

&quot;Even false things are true,&quot; said Nasrudin.

&quot;But how can that be?&quot;

&quot;I don't know. I didn't do it,&quot; shrugged Nasrudin.
}}
* Truth is found in yourself, not in others.
* Do not look to men for Truth.  They may be even more confused than you are.

== Telling a lie ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
One day Nasruddin and his friends decided to play a joke on the people in a village.  So Nasruddin drew a crowd, and lied to them about a gold mine in a certain place.  When everybody ran to get their hands on the gold, Nasruddin started running with them.  When asked by his friends why he was following them, he said &quot;So many people believed it, that I think it may be true!&quot;}}
* Liars eventually come to believe their own lies
* Trust can be exploited
* The behaviour of crowds is strange, and rarely relates to the truth
* Don't judge the truth by what others believe

== The Trial of Nasrudin ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
The king’s three scholars had accused Nazrudin of heresy, and so he was brought into the king’s court for trial.

In his defense, Nazrudin asked the scholars, “Oh wise men, what is bread?”

The first scholar said, “Bread is sustenance; a food.”

The second scholar said, “Bread is a combination of flour and water exposed to the heat of a fire.”

The third scholar said, “Bread is a gift from God.”

Nazrudin spoke to the king, “Your Majesty, how can you trust these men? Is it not strange they cannot agree on the nature of something they eat every day, yet are unanimous that I am a heretic?”
}}

* There are many ways to see even the most simple of things.
* People rush to judgment in matters of import.
* Different ways of seeing the same thing are not necessarily incompatible.
* People are clueless and disorganized.  Their judgements means nothing.

== Nasreddin and the Sultan's Horse ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
One day, while Nasreddin was visiting the capital city, the Sultan took offense to a joke that was made at his expense.  He had Nasreddin immediately arrested and imprisoned; accusing him of heresy and sedition.  Nasreddin apologized to the Sultan for his joke, and begged for his life; but the Sultan remained obstinate, and in his anger, sentenced Nasreddin to be beheaded the following day.  When Nasreddin was brought out the next morning, he addressed the Sultan, saying &quot;Oh Sultan, live forever!  You know me to be a skilled teacher, the greatest in your kingdom.  If you will but delay my sentence for one year, I will teach your favorite horse to sing.&quot;

The Sultan did not believe that such a thing was possible; but his anger had cooled, and he was amused by the audacity of Nasreddin's claim.  &quot;Very well,&quot; replied the Sultan, &quot;you will have a year.  But if by the end of that year you have not taught my favorite horse to sing, then you will wish you had been beheaded today.&quot;

That evening, Nasreddin's friends were allowed to visit him in prison, and found him in unexpected good spirits. &quot;How can you be so happy?&quot; they asked.  &quot;Do you really believe that you can teach the Sultan's horse to sing?&quot;  &quot;Of course not,&quot; replied Nasreddin, &quot;but I now have a year which I did not have yesterday; and much can happen in that time.  The Sultan may come to repent of his anger, and release me.  He may die in battle or of illness, and it is traditional for a successor to pardon all prisoners upon taking office.  He may be overthrown by another faction, and again, it is traditional for prisoners to be released at such a time.  Or the horse may die, in which case the Sultan will be obliged to release me.&quot;

&quot;Finally,&quot; said Nasreddin, &quot;even if none of those things come to pass, perhaps the horse can sing.&quot;
}}
* Do not despair of your circumstances.  Things are rarely as hopeless as they appear.
* Beware of offending the powerful, regardless of how much they deserve it.
* Clever words well-timed may succeed where reason and moral appeals fail.

== Nasreddin (or rather, Juha) and the Poem ==
This story comes from the Arab version of the character, who is known as Juha.
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
At some point in time, the Emir got it into his head that he was a poet. After working for many days and nights, he completes the poem, and asks Juha, a noted scholar of poetry, if he would come to the recital. Juha of course could not refuse.

After the Emir had completed reciting the poem, he asked Juha for his opinion. &quot;Are you sure, Sir?&quot; asked Juha, cautiously. Oblivious, the Emir said, &quot;Of course, that's why I brought you here!&quot; &quot;All right then,&quot; Juha replied, &quot;If it pleases Your Lordship, it's terrible.&quot;

Obviously angered, the Emir called out &quot;Guards! Put this man in prison.&quot; Turning to Juha, he said, &quot;Thirty days,&quot; and walked out in a huff.

Shortly after Juha had completed his sentence, the Emir called upon him to attend a recital of another poem. When the Emir finished reciting, Juha immediately rose to his feet and started for the door.

&quot;Where are you going, Juha?&quot; the Emir asked, surprised.

&quot;To the prison, sir.&quot;
}}

* Do not fear to speak truth to power
* Do not prolong the inevitable

== Nasreddin tells the truth ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
The Sultan of a great city was annoyed by the cheats and liars who entered his gates and caused trouble. He therefore set soldiers at all entrances. The soldiers were under orders to hang those who lied about their purpose for wishing to enter. 

The Mullah Nasreddin saddled his donkey and rode to the city. 

At the gate a guard stopped him and asked his purpose in wishing to enter and warned him that a lie would result in his being hanged.

&quot;This is good for I have come to be hanged.&quot; Said Nasreddin.

&quot;You are a liar and will certainly hang!&quot; Said the guard

&quot;Then you know I have spoken the truth and should not be hanged.&quot; said Nasreddin.

}}

* a fixed set of rules cannot be imposed everywhere, for every scenerio.

== Nasreddin's keys ==
{{Nasreddin tale|story=
One late evening Nasreddin found himself walking home. It was only a very short way and upon arrival he can be seen to be upset about something. Alas, just then a young man comes along and sees the Mullah's distress.

&quot;Mullah, pray tell me: what is wrong?&quot;

&quot;Ah, my friend, I seem to have lost my keys. Would you help me search them? I know I had them when I left the tea house.&quot;

So, he helps Nasreddin with the search for the keys. For quite a while the man is searching here and there but no keys are to be found. He looks over to Nasreddin and finds him searching only a small area around a street lamp.

&quot;Mullah, why are you only searching there?&quot;

&quot;Why would I search where there is no light?&quot;

This wikibook is intended to be an introduction to the Open source software movement. It is still getting organized.&lt;/center&gt;
==Introduction==
{{TOC right}}
In the last few years the Open Source movement has changed the face of computing more than almost anyone would have thought possible. Many people in the computer industry believe that these changes are the most important changes in computing since IBM contracted Microsoft to write an operating system for their personal computers. This book is intended to discuss the history, philosophy, and legal issues relating to Open Source, as well as ways for software developers to get involved by selecting and joining projects they want to contribute to.  More detail will be provided here than the Wikipedia articles on [[w:en:Open_source|Open Source]] and [[w:en:Free_Software|Free Software]], and information found in the Wikibook on [[Freeware]] will be enhanced and extended. Please feel free to add/correct information throughout the book. This book is '''not''' meant to be a listing of projects nor a guide to picking the best software to use (although some pointers are provided later in the book).

===What is Open Source?===
''Open Source'' or ''open-source software'' is different from ''proprietary'' software. In Open Source, the source code used in the software is available to ''anyone'' to examine, evaluate, and adapt. Open source has had an important impact on the way many developers view and create software.  End users often use the term open-source to cover a variety of ''free and open source software''.

The Open Source Initiative has this for a definition of open-source software:

Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:

'''1. Free Redistribution'''

The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale - with the exception of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial versions of the standard Creative Commons licence.

Rationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation to throw away many long-term gains in order to make a few short-term sales dollars. If we didn't do this, there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect. 

'''2. Source Code'''

The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost–preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

Rationale: We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve programs without modifying them. Since our purpose is to make evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy.

'''3. Derived Works'''

The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.

Rationale: The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent peer review and rapid evolutionary selection. For rapid evolution to happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute modifications.

'''4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code'''

The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of &quot;patch files&quot; with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.

Rationale: Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but users have a right to know who is responsible for the software they are using. Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they're being asked to support and protect their reputations.

Accordingly, an open-source license must guarantee that source be readily available, but may require that it be distributed as pristine base sources plus patches. In this way, &quot;unofficial&quot; changes can be made available but readily distinguished from the base source.

'''5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups'''

The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

Rationale: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources. Therefore we forbid any open-source license from locking anybody out of the process.

Some countries, including the United States, have export restrictions for certain types of software. An OSD-conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such restrictions itself.

'''6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor'''

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

Rationale: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source from being used commercially. We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.

'''7. Distribution of License'''

The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

Rationale: This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.

'''8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product'''

The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.

Rationale: This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps.

'''9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software'''

The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.

Rationale: Distributors of open-source software have the right to make their own choices about their own software.

Yes, the GPL is conformant with this requirement. Software linked with GPLed libraries only inherits the GPL if it forms a single work, not any software with which they are merely distributed.

'''10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral'''

No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.

Rationale: This provision is aimed specifically at licenses which require an explicit gesture of assent in order to establish a contract between licensor and licensee. Provisions mandating so-called &quot;click-wrap&quot; may conflict with important methods of software distribution such as FTP download, CD-ROM anthologies, and web mirroring; such provisions may also hinder code re-use. Conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that (a) redistribution of the software will take place over non-Web channels that do not support click-wrapping of the download, and that (b) the covered code (or re-used portions of covered code) may run in a non-GUI environment that cannot support popup dialogues. 

Free software is open-source software, but not all open-source software is free.

===What is Free Software?===
Free software is software that adheres to the concept of the four freedoms of software, as articulated by the GNU Project. These four freedoms are as follows:

*The user is free to use the software for any purpose.
*The user is free to study the mechanisms by which the program operates and to adjust these mechanisms to a specific purpose.
*The user is free to redistribute the software to another user.
*The user is free to adapt and improve the program and release these adaptations and improvements to the public.  

Free Software shares much of its philosophy with Open-Source software, but many people within the open source community feel that there are important distinctions between the terms, as described in the section Free Software vs. Open-source software. 

Often Free Software is referred to as &quot;free as in speech, not as in beer&quot;, stressing the idea that the Free-software movement is concerned with ''freedom'', not with ''price''.

===Free Software vs. Open Source software===

The primary distinction of open source software is that it's not about freedom, it's about what software does things better.

This requirement is not true of all open source licenses. In this book we hope to provide enough information so that the reader can understand what the two are and make choices accordingly.

As a whole the movement is often called ''&quot;Free and Open-Source software&quot;'' (FOSS).  While many people  point to the differences between the two, this book will focus on what unites the two. For the purposes of clarity the abbreviation ''FOSS'' will be used when describing issues that apply to all open source software projects, whereas ''OSS'' will be used when describing issues that apply only to software with open-source licenses that allow future developers to close the source code, and ''FSS'' will be used when talking about issues that apply only to software with free licenses requiring future developers to maintain the previous style of licensing (if not the license itself).

===Public Domain Software===
Another common form of open-source software is software that has entered into the [[w:en:public_domain|public domain]].  This is software that is unrestricted by copyright or licenses, and therefore free to use for any purpose.   Before the rise of the open-source software movement a great deal of software written in academic circles was released into the public domain for peer-review.  This practice has changed with the rise of a more intentional open-source movement, resulting in much software that was once public domain, now being released as FOSS.  The public domain is where many resources used in open-source projects come from, but there are few major projects that operate totally within the public domain (Examples include SQLite).

===FOSS does not mean no cost===
This is a common misunderstanding about FOSS, in no small part because nearly all FOSS programs are available free of charge.  For example when the text editor [[w:en:Emacs|Emacs]] was first released [[w:en:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]] charged from time to time to get copies.  Developers have the choice to charge under most FOSS licenses, although they rarely choose to.  The only requirement to be a truly FOSS project is that the publisher provides the source code with the program, and to allow the user to edit that code.

On top of the initial cost of purchasing software, there are other ongoing costs associated with all software.  This can come in the form of support agreements, the cost of customization, training costs support personnel and other sources.  This is true of both traditional commercial software and FOSS programs.  There is a large and active debate about which type of software is more expensive over the long run for large corporations, for individual users there is little to no question that FOSS is cheaper by far.

==History==
The history given here is not intended to be a complete, and perfect rendering of the history of the open source movement.  Indeed it would be quite impossible to do so, as we are currently in the middle of the movement, and proper histories cannot be written about current events.  Instead this chapter is intended to give the reader a general understanding of how the open source movement got started, so they can better understand the current debates.

In the beginning ([[w:1960's|1960's]] and [[w:1970's|1970's]]) nearly all code was provided as a form of open-source. Since you had to get programs to run on many different machines, companies that wanted customers to be able to run their software they had to provide the source code to compile themselves. Frequently this code was not encumbered by licensing agreements, or those licenses were never enforced. Often the users would notice flaws in the programs, fix them, and provide the improvements back to the publisher at no charge. Unix user groups often shared code with each other as well, creating an even larger body of code to work from.  At the time most companies believed that hardware would always generate far more profit than software.

At the same time when academics wrote programs as part of their research, they would often release the code into the public domain to others to learn from their work. The first email server, ftp server, and web server were all public domain projects that were created by academics and shared as public domain software.

Over time the hardware became more standardized.  This allowed software publishers to tighten up on what segments of code they would allow their users to see and edit.  This tightening started to frustrate users, especially academics, since they could no longer fix the problem they found, and from time to time found that they couldn't use the hardware or software they wanted to.  This trend mostly continued in main stream software, strengthed by the rise of Microsoft.

During the late [[w:1970's|1970's]], many small businesses attempted to  survive writing software for the new microcomputers. None were able to rely on hardware sales or after sale support contracts to subsidize  software development. Few of these people, whether from an academic tradition of freely distributed software or not, were willing to make their products available without fee. Perhaps most famously, [[w:Bill Gates|Bill Gates]] (a co-founder of Microsoft) realized that software, not hardware, held the prospect of being the greatest profit source in the new world of computing. When IBM needed an operating system for their personal computer, instead of writing their own, Microsoft licenced an early version of DOS, but retained the licensing rights for other hardware manufacturers. This choice changed the face of computing by creating a standard operating system that most personal computers would run on, it lead directly to Microsoft's dominance of personal computing, and later allowed them major access to the server side market as well.  Microsoft has grown into the largest software producer in the world, competing in almost every segment of the market. There are many people that feel that the only way to compete with Microsoft is through open source projects which leverage a far larger support base than most companies can provide.

In this sea of activity, the FOSS movement primarily grew out of two places: the Berkeley Software Distribution license from the University of California and Richard Stallman's Free Software Foundation Gnu Public License.

===BSD===
[[File:BSD wordmark.svg|thumb|right]]
During the 1970s, after Ken Thompson of Bell Labs spent a year teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, several research groups there began to develop software for the Unix operating system. And, as Bell Labs had no plans to port the system to the then new DEC VAX computer system, the Computer Science Research Group at Berkeley undertook the port. That port became very popular at other universities, and the CSRG began distribution of it, with their modifications and additions, under the name Berkeley Software Distribution. The researchers at Berkeley frequently found ways to improve or add to the existing versions of Unix. Bell Labs accepted some of the BSD changes, and passed on others. Over time the CSRG found ways to improve the basic aspects of Unix (eg, the file system). Concurrently, AT&amp;T made improvements of their own, causing the two versions to move in different (although similar) directions. As development progressed on the Berkeley version of Unix, it grew further and further away from the work that AT&amp;T was doing on their version (the last version of which was System V). In the early [[w:1990s|1990s]] there was a major legal skirmish over the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) between AT&amp;T, the University of California at Berkeley, and the Unix System Laboratories (USL), to which AT&amp;T had turned over the marketing and development of Unix. The suit resulted in most of BSD being found to be unencumbered by copyright restrictions by those who controlled the original Bell Labs code. By the mid-1990s, the CSRG released 4.4BSD-Lite, Release 2 as their final product as they were closed down by the Regents of the University of California. The BSD releases were the root of the various versions of BSD that are common today, most notably FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.  Throughout its development, BSD was distributed in an open manner, resulting in contributions from many different contributors.

===The Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project===

In [[w:1983|1983]] Richard Stallman (then of [[w:MIT|MIT]]) became frustrated with the growing commercialization of the computer development work that had been done at MIT, and with the increasing limitations imposed on software users. After a time, he began to create software that gave control to users.  His vision was to create an entire operating system totally free of the restrictions being imposed by proprietary licensing.  His first major software development effort (even before he became disenchanted with trends in the software industry) was the text editor, [[Emacs|GNU Emacs]]. His next was a [[Lisp Programming | LISP ]] system, a [[C Programming]] language compiler, and finally the GNU project. 

In [[w:1985|1985]] Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) to help generate support for the GNU Project.  FSF has grown into one of the most important organizations in the FOSS movement.  While the primary FSF mission continues to be the completion of the GNU operating system, FSF has also taken on the role of ''&quot;free-software evangelist&quot;'' by protecting and supporting free software. FSF also holds the copyrights to much of the source code written for the GNU project, ensuring that it always remains freely availabe to users.

Over the next 10 years Stallman gathered a group of people together who essentially developed all of the core utilities found in Unix and the Unix-like operating systems. In the Unix spirit, these consist of hundreds (perhaps thousands) of small utility programs and tools.  This project is still operating and is known as the GNU Project.  Many of these programs have become standard on the BSD variants as well (see above).  In 1994, Linus Torvalds released the first version of the Linux kernel, and when combined with the GNU utilities already available from the GNU Project, the Linux operating system came to be. The Debian distribution of Linux is called GNU/Linux, in recognition of Stallman's position that it is a joint production, to recognize that the GNU Project provides most of the essential utilities.  The GNU Project continues its slow progress on its own operating system kernel, which will be known as Hurd.  Hurd is intended to be offered as the official GNU replacement for the Unix kernel, though it is currently at a beta development stage.

While the FSF has become somewhat controversial, it has certainly had a major impact on computing. Millions of copies of the GNU software are used every day throughout the world.

==Philosophy==
There is no one philosophy that brings people to open-source software. There are however two main branches of thought in which many people share some similar views and have helped create a strong movement. To understand the open-source movement as a whole you need to understand both of these main philosophies.

===Software Freedom===
An earlier software movement similar to Open Source is the Free Software Movement (embodied in the Free Software Foundation). Although there is some debate over its precise definition, there are generally three primary components of software freedom.

* '''Freedom to Use'''
Many believe that software should not have limitations on their private use, aside from restrictions on the creator's liability. In contrast, some commercial packages (like Microsoft Windows) disallow certain usages while a more expensive product allows such a use. According to US copyright law, this right is implicit unless limited by private contracts.

* '''Freedom to modify'''
Possibly more important than the freedom to use is the freedom to modify existing programs. Although certainly related to the overall open-source ideal, this freedom also implies that your modifications remain yours. Some open-source licences require the modifier to assign the rights to their work to the originator of the license (Microsoft's Shared Source program is generally considered one example). Obviously, very few completely commercial software packages give users this freedom. In US copyright law, this is an implicit exclusive right of the creator of a work. To give others this right, the creator must agree to do so.

* '''Freedom to distribute'''
A final key freedom is the ability to distribute software, modified or unmodified. Software packages that limit their distribution limit others freedom to do with it what they will. It can also prevent them from providing their improvement to the community. Similar to the freedom to modify, some open-source licences also limit the freedom to distribute, often requiring changes to be submitted back to some central repository. As with the right to modify, this is an exclusive right of the creator.

Notably absent from these freedoms is the requirement that free software be economically free. Several licences do not prevent merchants from selling the software whether modified or unmodified. In fact, several groups have historically charged for various pieces of software which are generally considered free software. Depending on the licence, the merchant may still be under other restrictions. 

An example of a licence that provides software freedom with some restrictions on the distributer of the software is the GNU General Public Licence, or GPL. The GPL was written by Richard Stallman et al., for the GNU Project. The GPL has all of the above freedoms listed within. The most important difference from the above baseline is what the Creative Commons calls a &quot;Share and Share Alike&quot; clause. If you distribute a modification to a particular software package under the GPL, then you must agree that your portion of the work is also licenced by the GPL. For more information about the GPL there is more information in the [[Open_Source#Important_FOSS_licenses| licenses section]] of this book

===Open Source Development Model===
The second main branch of open-source philosophy revolves around the opportunity for a new software development model. Open-source is also about sharing ideas, and spreading the effort of creating software over a large number of interested developers.  This sharing can lead to better software in shorter development times.  It also allows for better feedback directly to the developers than is often present in traditional development models. Major companies like Apple and IBM have recognized that there can be a significant advantage to writing software in this way. Apple by way of the Darwin project and IBM through several significant donations of software and patents to open source groups have paved the way for other companies to seriously consider using this development model.

==Licences and Patents==

===What Is A License?===
In legal theory, a '''license''' is the permission or right granted to engage in some act without which the act might be otherwise unlawful. A license must be granted by a person, institution, or government that has the legal authority to do so. The term &quot;license&quot; also refers to the document that specifically describes these permissions and rights. 

===Important FOSS Licenses===
While there are many open source licenses in use today, a few have emerged as more popular (and therefore more important) than most.  We will take some time here to examine these important licenses in some detail.  They are listed here in alphabetical order.

For an extensive list of open source licenses see the [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html GNU Project's list of licenses], or [http://www.opensource.org/licenses  The OSI list of licenses].

====Apache====

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a non-profit corporation to support Apache software projects. Apache's projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license. Among the ASF's objectives are to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects, and to protect the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations.

There are currently two forms of the Apache in wide use today: versions 1.1 and 2.0.  While 2.0 is considered by ASF to be the current version and most users have happily switched, a few large groups objected to new clauses inserted into 2.0 regarding patents, and have refused to use any software with the new license (most notable the OpenBSD project).

Code under Apache license can be linked with the proprietary code that is developed in the companies. Because of this the license is accepted inside the most of the companies. Companies time to time contribute to the code under Apache license to boost the activity of these projects. For instance, IBM and Intel have contributed big parts of the alternative java implementation to the Apache Harmony project.

====BSD====

BSD is both a license, and a class of licenses (generally referred to as BSD-like). The modified BSD license (in wide use today) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix (see [[Open_Source#BSD|BSD history]] above). The BSD license is a simple license that merely requires that all code licensed under the BSD license be licensed under the BSD license IF redistributed in source code format.  BSD (unlike some other licenses) does not require that source code be distributed at all.

BSD is actually very close, though still distinct, from a public domain licence. Like works in the public domain, BSD-like licences permit nearly free modification and distribution of a work. There are only two significant ways in which BSD-like licences differ from public domain. First, the BSD licence carries the requirement that the licence, along with it's statement of copyright, is carried along with the work, or modified copies. This does not however limit code under different licences from being combined with it. Second, the BSD-like licences have a standard disclaimer of guarantees, such as fitness for a particular use and merchantability. This latter portion should not come as any surprise, since practically all software packages carry a clause nearly identical to this one.

In summary, the major difference between BSD-like licences and the public domain is that BSD licenced works must remain attributed to the original creator(s). Some BSD licences take this further, and require similar copyright statements in advertising materials for a distributed software product. Most however are simply limited this basic requirement.

For those who are opposed to the GPL for its limitations on modification and distribution, the BSD licence is often quite acceptable. Due to the inherent lack of limitations, BSD code can be incorporated into any other project, commercial or otherwise, removing a lot of the worries of licencing issues from code. Similarly, for those who endorse the licences such as the GPL for their ability to protect software freedoms, the BSD is looked upon as a step in the right direction, but not enough to guarantee said freedoms. They often encourage the use of more GPL like licences for this reason.

BSD is usually accepted inside the companies. The Apple Mac OS is based on the originally BSD - licensed operating system but with big parts of proprietary code.

====GPL====

The GNU General Public License is a free software license, created by the [[Wikipedia:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF); version 2 was released in 1991. It is usually abbreviated to GNU GPL, or, simply, GPL.  FSF recently announced that they have started work on version 3 of this license, and should be releasing the new version in the spring of 2007. The motivations for these changes have not been articulated yet, but based on a lecture by Richard Stallman held at New York's Cooper Union on November 29, 2005, the changes are related to the [[Wikipedia:World Intellectual Property Organization|World Intellectual Property Organization]]'s (WIPO) work on world copyright standardization.

The GPL protects the 3 main articles of software freedom as defined in the section on [[Open_Source#Software_Freedom|Software Freedom]].  The GPL also contains a clause requiring publishers of GPL licensed programs, that make modifications to the software, to distribute that modification under the GPL. This is something that many company managers do not like because they want proprietary control on all code that was written in the company. Even if the software is for internal use only and is never sold, the managers still want proprietary control to be sure that the software will not be used by a concurrent. Trying to create the negative attitude, GPL oponents gave GPL the label &quot;viral&quot;, since it apparently &quot;infects&quot; any code which it touches. 

From the other side, it is possible to say that GPL is tuned to support and even enforce the code sharing as much as possible. Companies and individuals that write code and release it under GPL get access to the large amount of the existing code under GPL. That way they are rewarded for picking this license and probably can afford to experiment with GPL compatible business models that otherwise bring less direct profit than proprietary control on the code.

It is not true that GPL is never accepted inside the companies: many companies have used software libraries under this license and did released all code that interacts with these libraries, as the license requires. This is how GNU gcc compiler have got C++ support, for instance. It is also true that GPL seems one of most popular licenses in the world. However the most of the companies will likely first try to contact the authors of the GPL-covered software, asking to sell the &quot;commercial&quot; license. 

====LGPL====

An important corner-case of the GPL requires that only GPL code can link with with GPL libraries, even if the library is contained in a separate file, and the code which uses it contains no GPL code unto itself. This is seen by some as too strict, since such an action could be considered a &quot;use&quot; of the library, not as a modification. In order to allow for such a distinction, the LGPL was created. The LGPL fixes precisely this problem: If someone uses an LGPL work as a library which is symbolically linked with a project, the rest of the project does not have to be put under the LGPL. On the other hand, if any modifications are made to the LGPL'ed work which are distributed along with the software package as a whole, the changes must be made public, similar to the rules of the GPL. The &quot;L&quot; in the LGPL stands for different things for different people. Initially it was considered as a &quot;Library&quot; licence, since the clause specifically dealt with issues of linking. However, the GNU Foundation describes this as the &quot;Lesser&quot; GPL, since it gives fewer protections to the work than the GPL does. While the GNU Foundation does not frown upon the use of the LGPL, it encourages the use of the GPL when possible.

LGPL makes a clear difference between the code that has been covered by this license (usually software library) and the external code that is just linked to the LGPL covered code. The external code can stay proprietary. However modifications inside the LGPL covered library must be shared with public.

Companies usually find LGPL terms acceptable and it is common to find public libraries with this license inside the commercial software.

====GPL + linking exception ====
GPL + linking exception license sounds like GPL but in additional chapters explicitly allow to link the code it covers together with any other code, regardless of its licensing terms. Hence while it sounds similar, GPL + exception in practice looks more like LGPL. This license has been recently used for several large projects, including java implementation by Sun Microsystems.

===A brief note about copyrights and copylefts===
Software licensing should not be confused with copyright protections.  Open-source licensing explicitly relies on copyright law protections and no code licensed under most of those licenses are a release to the public domain. The author of a piece software can limit the use of what he created, since the code is a written work and subject to copyright law provisions. A creator can limit use of the software as desired, since copyright is a privilege of exclusive use. Copyright protections allow a copyright holder (not necessarily an author) to control use and distribution of software via licensing. That license may allow changes (as does the GPL) or prohibit them (as do most commercial EULA agreements).

The concept of copyleft also grew out of the work by GNU and others in the open source movement.  While copyright is intended to most protect written works from unauthorized use, and most commercial copyright licenses do so by prohibiting changes or distribution, copyleft licenses encourage free and widespread use.

''Note:  Wikibooks is made available under the copyleft [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GNU Free Documentation License].''

===Patents===
In the past few years the issue of software patents has become one of the most pressing to those in the open-source movement.  In the United States and some other countries software is subject to patent protections.  While only some other countries have placed similar restrictions on the production of software the patent system in the US has become problematic worldwide.

==Economics of FOSS==

===Zero Marginal Cost===
At the heart of the economics of FOSS is the zero marginal cost of goods in a digital environment. In this respect, the emergence of FOSS represents a confirmation of classical microeconomic price theory - that an equilibrium price in a perfect market approximates the marginal cost. From this perspective, FOSS can be understood as a pioneer in reaching what can be understood as an evolutionarily stable dynamic Nash equilibrium in  truly free market.

===Income-generation opportunities===
While contributing time and effort in developing, enhancing and documenting FOSS does not provide any direct income, the development of expertise in FOSS provides a broad range of income-generating opportunities - from generating in-house savings from enhancements to FOSS to consulting opportunties in installing, training, customizing and the provision of technical support for FOSS installations. In Part I: The Networked Information Economy of ''The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom'' (Yale University Press, 2006) [http://habitat.igc.org/wealth-of-networks/], Yochai Benkler provides an excellent analysis - with IBM's stategy as a key example - of ways that income and wealth are being generated through open source and open content strategies. 

==== Opportunities for the companies ====
Other possible ways of getting money from FOSS include:
* Dual license model, when the same code is provided both under aggressive FOSS licence (usually GPL) and &quot;commercial&quot; license that does not demand sharing of the derived works. The GPL version ensures wider user base, more popularity and may serve as an &quot;evaluation version&quot;. This model is used by many companies, most notably by Trolltech with QT.
* Paid documentation model, when the software and convinceable examples are delivered as FOSS but some really good documentation is described in a book that must be bought, or in a separate documentation package which is for sale. 
* Use of trademark. If the derived works cannot use the original trademark (logo, name) then the original work may be preferred by the user who is willing to pay for that one understands as a sign of high quality. This model is only possible if the trademark owner is already widely known as an expert in software development. It is successfully used by Red Hat.
* Use of the paid auto update service. In this case the paying user receives opportunity to get and install security and other important updates automatically. Non-paying user needs much more effort to keep the system up to date. This model is used by many commercial Linux distributions.
* Using the certification system, when the owner of the leading FOSS technology provides the paid certification exams to prove the qualification of the user (usually software developer). Many owners of the popular FOSS products (Sun Microsystems, Red Hat and others) offer the paid certifications that are recognized and valued by employers.
* Providing paid support for porting the FOSS to the new processor, device or operating system.
* Developing FOSS that at the given moment runs primarily on the device that is sold by the same company. FOSS adds the value to the device that now can attract more attention, be sold for the higher price or just simply become usable. This model is frequently used when porting Linux into mobile devices and other unusual platforms, it also enables companies to develop open source drivers for the hardware they produce.
* Using FOSS components (including components under GPL) to develop highly specialized software for internal use inside the same company. As such software is never officially distributed, there is no need to get profit from selling it. GPL does not demand to publish the source of the software that has been never released to public.
* Reaching new groups of customers. There are many FOSS enthusiasts in the world. The company that makes an open source - friendly product will likely attract these customers who prefer such products over its  alternatives. An example is the FIC OpenMoko project where tens of thousands of FOSS - friendly mobile phones have been sold even while still unsuitable for the normal end user. Also, some Linksys routers and most notably the NSLU2 device have a completely unexpected group of users who were just interested in hacking their internals.

==== Opportunities for individuals ====
* For the individual developer, joining the FOSS project and contributing the code may provide expertise  that is difficult to obtain in alternative ways. Software engineer that knows capabilities of the available FOSS, how to build it, how to port it and how to get the most use from it may be able to save large sums for her company. In some cases developing the FOSS replacement gives the direct expertise on the highly similar proprietary product. The notable examples include GNU Classpath and Sun Microsystem's Java, DotGNU or Mono and Microsoft's .NET and also various FOSS and proprietary implementations of J2EE. Such expertise is the most easy to get by contributing to the existing, highly successful FOSS project.
* Participating in FOSS helps to build a professional social network: a group of people that know well enough and if needed can recommend you as a programmer. 
* For the maintainers of the small but comparatively popular projects, offering the paid documentation may work, especially if this documentation is easy to buy online.

===Problems with traditional commercial software===
First it should be noted that the commercial software industry is one of the largest and most important industries in the world.  The rise of the Open Source movement does not necessarily spell the end of the commercial software industry.  On the contrary, many people argue that commercial software can be strengthed by the use of open-source techniques. Commercial software is designed to provide a product worth paying for and most of it is (that's why the industry is so big). Despite its price tag, commercial software is often far from perfect.

Commercial products will be updated frequently in order to reflect the fluctuating demands of the market and customer needs. These needs can lead to software practices that rearrange and rewrite the software too frequently, or release beta versions as commercial endeavours resulting in high rates of bugs in early versions. Some commercial programs are over designed and written in sloppy code leading to bloated, slow, running programs. Open Source by contrast is driven by the needs of the end users. The skills of the coders is in taking personal pride in what they do, not rushing to meet artificially imposed deadlines (except their own). Thereby their code is often of a superior calibre than that of programmers in the commercial environment. There is also usually a very extensive degree of feedback as the programmers test their products within a wide network of people.

When source code is available, it can be checked against various &quot;back doors&quot; and other security holes that may be intentionally or unintentionally left in the closed source software. In the past such holes have been found in multiple proprietary products, including software, used by the government. Advanced developers value source code of the used components as an important additional documentation.

Having source code also means that the software can be easily ported to run under different processor, device or operating system. Proprietary software can usually only be legally ported by the original developer that may or may not treat such request as important enough to work on it. 

Another problem with traditional commercial software is its closed nature. There is usually no or limited freedom to tamper with the copyrighted product. Also, companies often force users to follow upgrade paths that they may not wish to follow. Open source software enables the individual to customize the software to his end needs in all freedom. Another heavily criticised aspect of commercial software is that customers are frequently locked-in to a product because to keep using data files you are often forced to continue to use the same program. If you wish to share files with users that have upgraded, you often have to upgrade yourself or be written off as irrelevant.  Since open source software allows competing programs to share different data file types, there is no reason to be trapped into any one program. If a newer version has a new file format, then there often are converters that allow users of older versions to keep up their data files up to date.

===Free doesn't mean no Cost===
While FOSS is free to the end user, there is a cost associated with developing the software. These costs may be smaller than developing proprietary software, because developing the project under FOSS license means that:
* Numerous web portals like SourceForge would offer web hosting, content repository, mailing lists and other essential features for free. 
* The cost of advertising a FOSS project (like presenting it in the related conferences) is usually lower.
* Developing something under GPL may give free access to high quality components (like QT) that are otherwise expensive to buy or not available at all.

Still, development of any software first requires the developer time. Only very popular projects may expect to get a high quality code contributions for free.

==Internationalization==
The open nature of Open Source Software allows for extensive internationalization of software.  OS's can be modified for any language, for example recently a version of Linux was translated into Welsh (spoken in Wales).  While many major commercial projects are provided in multiple languages, it is often too expensive to translate them into more than 3 or 4 languages.  Many FOSS projects are available in 10 or more languages, as the translation can be done by a programmer who wants the package to be available in his or her native tongue.

==Case Studies==
Probably the four best known Open Source projects in the world today are: the Apache web server, the BSD operating system, the Linux kernel, and the Mozilla web browser (or its spin off, Firefox).

===Apache===
[[File:Apache_Software_Foundation_Logo_(2016).svg|thumb|right|Logo of the Apache Foundation.]]
The [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache web server]] is currently the most popular web server in the world.  Nearly 70% of all web sites are served by Apache.

The Apache project grew out of an attempt to improve upon the original web server httpd.  httpd, was a public domain software project that was largely abandoned in the early [[w:1990's|1990's]].  At that time it was the most popular web server in use, and several developers recognized that development needed to continue.  Since httpd was in the public domain they were able to continue work on the program and include a great number of improvements.  They quickly organized themselves into the Apache Foundation, to have a stable organization to oversee the on-going work on their new web server.  Apache's version of httpd quickly overtook the original httpd as the most popular web server in use.

Over time the Apache Foundation grew to house many related open source projects.  Including Tomcat, a popular Java servlet server, and many others.

After many years of developing Apache 1.x, the Apache Foundation found that some of the original architecture of Apache was starting to show it's age, and further extensions were becoming impossible.  Therefore a team of mostly volunteer developers started to develop Apache 2.  Apache 2 is a complete rewrite of Apache, and has allowed the Apache Foundation to add new flexibility of their flagship product.

The stature of the Apache Foundation has also allowed them to become a repository for significant donations of software to the open source community.  Most notably 2 large donations from IBM to the Apache Foundation in 2004.

===BSD===
BSD (short for ''Berkley Software Distribution'') is a family of three free Unixes, namely OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD. They are all successors of BSD 4.4.

===Linux===
[[File:NewTux.svg|thumb|right|Tux the Penguin, the mascot of Linux]]
The [[w:Linux|Linux]] kernel is currently one of the most active, and most important, free and open source software development projects.  In 1991, [[w:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]] used the Internet to invite collaboration on his infant project to develop an operating system kernel suporting a system very much like Unix. He wanted a Unix-like operating system that would work on his computer, an early and expensive 386 machine, and was unsatisfied with anything available at an affordable cost, including academic teaching examples like [[Minix]] (from Professor [[Andrew Tannenbaum]]). Since then the Linux kernel has been used in multiple Linux system distributions that are currently supported by organizations like [[w:IBM|IBM]], [[w:Novell|Novell]], HP, many universities (eg, ETH-Zurich), Bell Labs, and Borland. The Linux kernel is the kernel used in the GNU/Linux operating system, and is currently in its 2nd major version release, and 6th minor version. The official home page of the Linux kernel project is [http://www.kernel.org kernel.org]

GNU/Linux operating system is a textbook example why freedom to share the modified works is important. In his discussions Tannenbaum writes that he have frequently received suggestions to extend Minix in one or another way but was very strict when accepting these extensions. He tried to keep the system simple, easy to study and understand. People who wanted to convert it into the true next generation OS were not able to do this because direct sharing of the modified code was not allowed by the license, requiring to publish patches against the Tannebaum's version instead.

The second textbook example covers the FSF itself who have decided to refuse the available monolithic kernel and turned into difficult way of developing the microkernel based Hurd that even in 2009 have not yet been production ready. This error likely was serious enough to kill all GNU project, but FSF was protected by its own philosophy: GPL have allowed another, Linux, kernel to come, so the work spent building numerous other parts of the alternative operating system was not lost.

===Mozilla (Firefox)===
Mozilla and the more recent Firefox are open source derivatives of the Netscape Navigator web browser.  As a result of the release of Firefox 1.0 the web saw the first major shift in web browser usage in 5 years.

===GNU Classpath===
GNU Classpath is a project aiming to create a free software implementation of the standard class library for the Java programming language. GNU Classpath development started in 1998 with five developers. The initial progress was rather slow because Sun was already offering its own java implementation free of charge (including commercial use) and with the source code available. Still, porting to new platforms, connecting to new virtual machines and various unusual projects required to distribute the modified versions - this was not allowed by Sun's license at that time. During the history, the project merged several times with other projects having similar goals (Kaffe, libgcj). In the past, GNU Classpath supplied its own virtual machine (Japhar). As Classpath was becoming a base library, shared with a lot of different projects, this virtual machine received less and less attention until it was dropped as no longer supported. 
The project started to accelerate after approaching completeness of java 1.2 API, when it was clearly seen that some companies are joining, allowing they developers to contribute to the project at working time. GNU Classpath has become a part of near any Linux distribution and was ported to numerous processors and operating systems; some of them do not have any other java support till these days. Wave of talks passed through the conferences, demonstrating for the surprised public that there are ''fully functional'' alternative Free implementations of Swing, CORBA and other complex libraries that - it was believed - can never be completed by the community of volunteers.

The project status have changed after Sun released it own java implementation under near identical license (GPL+Exception). The primary purpose - to have the efficient java implementation under Free Software license - has been reached in another way. As both libraries implemented the same API and now had nearly identical licenses, it seemed doubtful that they can find they own groups of users rather than just taking one under another.

While the rise of Sun's OpenJDK meant the end of the increased status and prospects to join the history as authors of the long lived alternative java system, GNU Classpath community have shown self control keeping to serve the Free Software as good as they could: there were no opposition in the mailing lists, no attempts to create the negative image of Sun's project - shortly, no any trying to prevent replacement of GNU Classpath by OpenJDK that - now being open source - still was superior in performance. Sun has released its own libraries quite at time when GNU Classpath was about to become a fully working alternative and real competitor and it quite may be that this have contributed to the Sun's decision. Hence GNU Classpath may stay in a history as a successfull project. This project seems still active and attracts contributions, maybe because its virtual machine interface is historically much more adapted to connect various virtual machines. It is a common choice as extension of the Google Android to provide parts that were removed from the Google implementation as &quot;unnecessary&quot;.

==Joining the existing Open Source Project ==
Creating your own Open Source Project may be the first thing that comes in mind, but the general advice for the beginner would be '''do not do this'''. The project must be based on a really good idea and needs cooperation of more than one developer to be really successful. Otherwise you may just observe the download counter slowly ticking up, but never get any other feedback. It is usually much better to start from joining the existing project and starting your own later, when you already have enough experience. For the same reason it is better not to start from the attempt to revive the abandoned project which has already lost its previous team (see [http://www106.pair.com/rhp/hacking.html why]).

&lt;!-- Important: The text below is similar to the text from Wikihow article &quot;How to become a Free Software Hacker&quot;. This is because it is written by the same author, me, Audrius Meskauskas. The author is not bound by the license, I give the same text to WikiBooks under GFDL also. --&gt;
Writing and using Free software is not just programming, it is a kind of philosophy. While programming language is all you need to program, it seems also important to join the community, get friends, do a great work together and become a respected specialist with profile you cannot get anywhere else. 
=== Steps ===
==== Initial preparation ====
Be sure you are competent enough to make a valuable contribution as a programmer. Without this, you are useless to the developer community so nobody will talk to you. The next most important tool to master is the version control ([http://www.linux.ie/articles/tutorials/cvs.php CVS], [http://www.linux.ie/articles/subversion/index.php SVN]). Understand how to create and apply patches (text difference files). The most of the FOSS development in the community is done creating, discussing and applying various patches.

==== Searching for the first project to join ====
While a highly popular and very successful project may give you lots more expertise, such projects are also quite demanding to their contributors. You are expected to follow coding style, write CHANGELOG entries, create and apply patches, cover your code with tests and so on. Without experience that is expected and why, all this may end up by conflict between you and the project community. If you are totally new with FOSS, it may be more efficient to start from something less demanding, at least for a short time. Most of the small projects that are very easy to join now can be found on SourceForge.net. The suitable project must:
#Use the programming language you already know.
#Be active, with recent releases. Usually a project that has no release for more than a year is considered dormant if not dead.
#Already have three to five developers or about. 
#Use version control. 
#Have some part you think you can immediately start implementing without modifying the existing code too much.
#Apart from the code, a good project also has the active discussion lists, bug reports, receives and implements requests for enhancement and shows other similar activities.

Some FOSS portals offer &quot;job openings&quot; where administrators of the active projects are actively posting invitations for new developers. These may be interesting to read but it may be better just to search for a project you like, regardless if it posts invitations or not.

==== Joining the first project ====
#Contact the administrator of the selected project. In a small project with few developers your help will usually be immediately accepted. 
#Carefully read the rules of the project and more or less follow them. The rules of the coding style or necessity to document your changes in a separate text file may first appear ridiculous to you. However the purpose of these rules is to make the shared work possible - and the most of projects do have them.
#Work in this project for several months. Listen carefully that the administrator and other project members say. Apart programming, you have a lot of things to learn. But if you really do not like something, just go away to another project.
#Do not stick with the underground project for too long. As soon as you find yourself successfully working in that team, it is time to look for the serious one.

==== Joining the second project ====
#Find a serious, high level Free software or Open source project.
#As we are doing a serious jump now, be ready for the far cooler acceptance. You will likely be asked to work for some time without direct write access to the code repository. The previous underground project should, however, teach you a lot - so after several months of the productive contribution you may try do demand rights you think you could have.
#Take and do a serious task. Go on even after you discover that the task is lots more difficult than you initially thought - in this step it is important not to give up.
#If you can, apply with your serious task to the Google's &quot;Summer of code&quot; to get some money from this adventure. But just do not care if the application would not be accepted as they have far less funded positions than really good hackers working around.
#Look for a suitable conference happening nearby (&quot;Linux days&quot; or something similar) and try to present your project there (''all project'', not just the part you are programming). After you tell you are representing a serious Free / Open source project, the organizers frequently release you from the conference fee (if they do not, the conference is likely unsuitable anyway). Bring your Linux laptop (if you have one) and run demos. Ask the project administrator for the material you may use when preparing your talk or poster.
#Complete the task, cover with automatic tests and contribute to the project. At this point the initial goal of becoming the active member of the serious project is achieved. You may continue in the same project or later migrate into another one to learn something new. [[Image:GcAct_85.png|thumb|300px|Development history]]
#For better understanding, look into real example of the development history for a Free Software project (above). Each raising curve represents a contribution (lines of code) from single developer. Developers tend to become less active over years but the project frequently even accelerates as new people join.   Hence if you already come with some useful skills, there are no reasons why the team would not invite you.

=== Tips ===
*If you still do not trust yourself enough, start from some part of code that you think is missing and can be written from scratch. Changes in existing code are much more likely to attract criticism.
*For the beginning, select a class, module or some other unit under which nobody is very actively working at the moment. Working together on the same class or even function needs more skills and a lot of care from all sides.
*Before asking any questions about the working rules inside the project, try to search for the answer in the project documentation and mailing list archives.
*Avoid asking any questions related to fundamentals of programming or programming tools. The time of the Free software programmer is as valuable as gold and nobody can afford to teach you the basic.
*For the same reason, ''never'' expect an older hacker writing a detailed description of your task or even providing any kind of supervision for you. While open source projects may have a lot of strict rules, they usually work along the lines of that is known as [[wikipedia:Extreme Programming|extreme programming]] in the programming methodology.
*Linux is a rather good system now, but hackers widely used it even when it was far less complete in the past. For a hacker it is a lot more important that all corners of this system come with source code. They are open to explore, to understand, to change and to share your changes with others. Understanding starts from the trivial daily use (writings, mail, web and surely programming). Hence you must install Linux at least on a dual boot and start from using it for routine daily tasks like web surfing or programming.
*The employers of many hackers seem motivated enough to allow contributions during their working time (usually because the institution uses the Free/Open source program that the hacker is developing). Think, maybe you can get at least part of the needed time this way.
*Always continue the hacking you started. Does not build, does not run, crashes? There ''are'' reasons for everything and if you have source code this usually means that you ''can'' force the system to do whatever you want, especially with the help of the web search. This rule has its limits, but, indeed, never yield easily.
*Only say you are a hacker after some true hacker community recognizes you as such.

=== Warnings ===
While FOSS communities are in general very friendly and cooperative, it is important not to make some trivial mistakes that may result in an unpleasant experience.
*Avoid Windows, especially if you plan to meet Free software developers. Mac OS is tolerated somewhat better, but also not welcome. If you do bring your laptop, it must run Linux or another operating system that is considered as &quot;Free software&quot;. This may be less important in the Open Source communities but you likely will never miss by bringing Linux or a dual-boot laptop.
*If your mail client supports html messages, turn this feature off. Never attach documents that only proprietary software (like MS Word) can open properly. Hackers understand this as insulting.
*While the word &quot;hacker&quot; sounds respectable in most academic environments, for some uninformed people it may be associated with breaking into security systems and other computer-related crimes that a different social group, crackers do. Unless you are ready to explain, look to whom are you telling this word. Real hackers as they are meant in this article ''never'' join programming activities that seem for them illegal. First, they are proud of following the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic hacker ethic]. Second, the law violations are not necessarily better paid.
*Do not volunteer to the company-owned projects that are not releasing some parts of they code under approved Open Source license. In such cases the really important parts of the project are likely to stay behind the closed doors of the owner, preventing you from learning anything useful.
*Do not start from small code optimizations, extra comments, coding style improvements and other similar &quot;small-scale&quot; stuff. It may attract far more criticism than any serious contribution.

==Starting and Maintaining an Open Source Project==
===Getting Started===
[[w:Vaporware|Vapourware]] is software that is 'floated' to see if there is interest. Many projects, if donated to the open source methodology would find usage, development and markets much quicker. Lost code might be resurrected and enhanced. More and more computer users are learning to use the excellent development tools created and enhanced by programmers. If you have a good idea, open source is a way of making it happen.

===Project Management===
==== Necessary processes of the FOSS project ====
There is a typical set of tools that are usually involved in managing near any FOSS project. Small projects may not use some of them; large projects near always use them all. These tools, roughly by the  the frequency of usage, are:
* Version control repository that contains all past revisions of the project and can be accessed remotely. The past projects mostly used CVS. The recent projects usually use SVN or other tools.
* Bug/issue tracker that contains bug reports and requests for enhancement, together with subsequent comments and implementation status. One of the most frequently used tools there is Bugzilla.
* Mailing lists to discuss various aspects of the project development.
* Suite of automatic tests.
* CHANGELOG where all code changes are manually documented. This is especially important when there are many developers.
* Website that describes the project and provides both &quot;getting started&quot; and advanced documentation.
==== Contributors of the typical FOSS project ====
[[Image:GcAct_85.png|thumb|400px|The real example of the development history for a Free Software project (above). Each raising curve represents a contribution (lines of code) from single developer.]]
If the project depends on external contribution, it is important to attract new contributors over time. Volunteers tend to become less and less active over time, and donations from the companies are also frequently not continuous. This does not mean that the project stagnates: it may become even more active over time as new developers join. However it is obvious that novices must be welcome and maintaining the small group of &quot;elite developers&quot; that does not allow anybody else near to the code is problematic. The software quality is ensured using other methods (automatic tests and at least brief checking of all patches by older developers).

===Version Numbers===
Many new users find the FOSS projects often use strange version numbering systems. For instance it is very common to see software in wide distribution that has a version number less than 1.0. For example the web browser Firefox was widely used by version 0.6, more than a year before version 1.0 was finished. In the world of FOSS software it is generally considered important to work out all the known bugs before releasing version 1.0. While this is not a totally attainable goal, many users find early versions of software much more stable than early versions of their commercial counterparts.

Generally FOSS projects break their version numbers into 3 pieces: major version, minor update, point release. Major version is the first number in the version number; it is rare to see a free software project have a major version greater then 2 (although GNU Emacs is currently on version 21, so it is not unheard of). The minor update is the second number (the x in 2.x). A change in the number often signifies a significant update of the program. The third number (the y in 2.x.y) generally indicates a small update to fix a bug, or security problem. These numbers get very high, often over 30 or 40 over time. When a software project is well established most of their updates will come in the form of point releases.

Version numbers may also carry extra meanings. For instance ever since the Linux kernel went to version 2, it has been the practice of the design team to use odd numbers for development kernels, and even numbers for stable kernels. Therefore while it is common to see 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 all in use today, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5 are almost no where to be seen. There are still teams that work on supporting bug/security fixes to the 2.0, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. As of March 2005, this policy was under review by the primary authors of the Linux kernel, however there are many projects that use similar numbering schemes, and so it holds as a useful example.

When a software project changes the major version number, this generally indicates a complete rewrite of the software, or at least an extensive over haul. The Apache web server started a version 2.0 in 2003, after many years of 1.3.x versions. Apache2 is a near total rewrite of Apache, which provides many new features, and significantly improved the underlying code base. The apache foundation still maintains the 1.3.x code base, although most efforts for new code are done on the 2.0.x code base.

Writers of software may completely rewrite a program, improve software or unnecessarily inflate perfectly good software. If software works then there is little need to upgrade.

Also upgrading may solve some problems and add new ones. To give you an example 'Abi Word' is a fine word processor but it crashed on me. The complete package in Open Office has never done this nor has notepad or WordPad. New improved 'notepads' have occasionally crashed. So I stopped being seduced by what has many features. Any software that has the hidden feature of crashing is a liability. I have used Miranda IM without problem, others find it does not work.

==Open Source Hardware==
Various computer hardware frequently has its own specific features that only specialized piece of the software can read properly. As a rule, the operating system contains device drivers that deal with all specifics, providing more general access for other programs. A manufacturer may choose to disclose the documentation that is required to write a driver or to keep it secret, offering the finished drivers instead.

The proprietary driver is usually a problem for the open source project. First, it usually has licensing limitations that limit its usage (being closed source is automatically incompatible with GPL). Second, there is no way to check such driver against bugs and security flaws. Finally, the driver is frequently simply not available for the platform of interest; it is quite usual to provide such drivers for only one operating system.

Because of these reasons Linux, Solaris and other open source operating systems may not provide the needed drivers for the hardware which does not have sufficient documentation. In cases when such hardware is very widespread and popular, experienced hackers may succeed to reverse-engineer the device and write their own driver without documentation. However this is a difficult and long process and the finished driver may still lack some functionality.

Hence before writing the open source software that uses some specific hardware like camera, advanced video or wireless it is always important to choose the equipment from the manufacturer that shares the necessary technical information or at least provides its own driver for your system, your platform and under conditions that are for you acceptable. This must be carefully checked in advance, without expecting that &quot;it will work anyway&quot; and especially without assuming that the manufacturer may change its position later.

For instance, when designing the fully open mobile phone (OpenMoko project), the FIC company have selected Hammerhead PMB 2520 chip for its first prototype, Neo1973. The documentation on accessing this chip directly has been secret. After long negotiations the manufacturer provided some driver but due licensing problems every user needed to download it from the special web site and install individually. As the phone was primarily targeted to the open source enthusiasts that do not like such &quot;binary blobs&quot;, in many cases the driver at the end was refused, leaving the GPS on the phone non functional. Further negotiations were not successful and FIC was forced to switch into completely different chip in the next iteration. Switching, however, required to redesign some circuitry. When the new phone has been delivered, it was discovered that due lack of time the new GPS device has not been properly tested and only worked when the SD card has been removed from its slot. While at the end all problems have been fixed and resolved, long delays and non-working devices likely reduced popularity of the project that had financial problems afterwards.

[http://opencollector.org/Whyfree/ Open Source Hardware] is developing free BIOS and CPU specs and electronic designs.

==Future Developments==
[[File:Wikimedia logo text RGB.svg|thumb|right|Wikimedia projects use the same principles as the open source and free software movement but apply it to knowledge.]]
FOSS is creating a new outlook. The attitude is of particular benefit to the commercial sector who obtain code and tools to commercialise. Developing nations and people can use no cost materials and resources. The developer community is trying out new systems and most importantly leaving a legacy that will be available for generations to come. 

===Ideas in use outside of technology===
Grass roots organizers have started to take on some of the ideas generated by the Free software movement. By encouraging more transparency and sharing of ideas grass roots groups have found they can motivate more people with less effort.

Projects like [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] and [[Wikibooks]] were founded with many of these same principals in mind.

==Tips for picking software==
There is no one best way to find FOSS projects that will best serve your needs.  There are several rules of thumb you can use to help you make informed decisions.

;Is this Open Source?
:Some companies try to attract more users, pretending that they offer FOSS software when they actually do not. The simple way to check this is to look if they license is [http://www.opensource.org/licenses OSI approved]. Unusual license frequently means that the project just pretends being FOSS.
;Do you already have something that will do the job well?
:Before you hunt up new software, make sure you do not already have a program that will do the job nicely. From the other side, having possibility to do the job does not mean that there is no software to do this more efficiently so it may be good to evaluate alternatives time to time.
;Does the program do what you want?
:While this might seem obvious, every IT support person can tell you stories of users that came to them asking for help using a particular tool because a friend recommended it, but it is the wrong tool for the job.
;Do you care about the ideologies behind free software and open source software, or need to work with people who care?
:There are many people that feel that using free software is an important part of how they live and work.  Such people will not replace FOSS program by proprietary regardless of the quality of the two. However recently many FOSS is not much worse than proprietary alternatives and some is better. 
;Do you know other people that already use it?
:Online reviews are great, but there is still nothing like talking to someone you know about a program they use every day. Real users can tell you how the program has performed over the long run.  Your friend may have discovered that while it worked great at first it was missing an important feature for a project you have in mind. Also if you are doing a common task with a program that no one else is using, there's probably a reason (and it's not likely that you're smarter than everyone else...sorry).
;Is the current version over a year old?
:If yes, then the project has most likely died or stagnated.  Active projects tend to produce new updates every few weeks or months.  While old releases may be a sign of a well written program, that needs little to no updating, often it is a sign that the programmers have moved on to other endeavours and abandoned the project.
;Are there user support mailing lists you can join?
:Particularly  when you are new to a program it is nice to be able to get support learning your way around. Email lists or web discussion boards are often excellent sources of support for FOSS programs.  Also look at the list's archives, if they are active lists you can get a sense of what the common problems, and how many people are using the program.

==Other Frequently Asked Questions==
===Is Open Source software always of better quality than other types of software?===
This depends strongly on that do you understand as the main requirements. But, in general, far from it. The same is true of any kind of software (semi-free, proprietary, etc.). Everywhere it is possible to find bad software and good software.

Programmers may still be learning, and provide their projects in an open-source venue as a means of quicker development by opening the project to others.  Lack of interest may result in abandoned projects. If the need and idea is good, open source is rapidly and effectively developed. The original developer may benefit from their experience as well as faster bug discovery by others in the community.  Expect many minor releases from Free and Open Source software.

===Is Open Source always of worse quality, then ? ===
Some managers think that due lack of funding FOSS just cannot be as good as the proprietary alternative and is only used because it is cheaper to get. In recent days, it is also not necessarily so, especially taking into consideration that the criteria may be different. It is possible to propose acceptance criteria where Linux beats Windows (there ''are'' tests that run faster and at least less viruses), Thunderbird beats Lotus Notes (less capable but way faster and also cross platform) and KPdf beats Acrobat Reader (at least starts faster). Software like Linux kernel, OpenSolaris operating system, Sun java implementation, Firefox, Thunderbird, Google Android and many others have been created investing huge amount of money in the past. It is a myth that open source is developed only by scarce isolated individuals so there is no any particular reason why it should always be worse.

===Where can I find Open Source Software?===
The most reliable way to get such software is to download it from the popular, recognized web portal. The situation changes over time, but the most popular portal currently seems being [http://www.sourceforge.net sourceforge.net]. Also see [http://www.gnu.org www.gnu.org] for a list of projects sponsored by the Free Software Foundation. Linux users usually get lots of the Open Source software with their distribution and can search for more with user friendly software management tools that are part of the operating system.

There are also Freeware sites that offer trial, restricted or even fully functional versions of some software for free. However it is important to understand that offering software for free does not make it Open Source by itself.

==Ingredients==
* 6 small [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (peeled and chopped in half)
* 2 small cans [[Cookbook:coconut|coconut milk]]
* 1/2 can [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 2 cloves chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper
* enough [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] to sauté garlic
* salt to taste

==Procedure==
# Sauté the garlic in olive oil.
# Add tomatoes.
# Cook for 10 minutes, until the oil and tomatoes separate (they will bubble).
# Add the coconut milk.
# Stir.
# Add 1/2 teaspoon red pepper, and salt to taste.
# Boil it all.
# Add the potatoes.
# Cook over low-medium heat until the potatoes are done (they will become fairly soft; check with a fork).  

This dish is extremely creamy and rich; don't expect to be able to eat much of it.  It goes very well with [[Cookbook:Indian Beans|Indian Beans]] and [[Cookbook:Indian Rice|Indian Rice]].

== Ingredients ==
* 500 grams [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]] (ideally penne)
* 3 generous tablespoons of olive oil
* 2 large garlic cloves, chopped 
* 1 onion, sliced (ideally, a red onion)
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecan]] halves
* 1 pack of frozen [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], or, better, a moderate amount of fresh spinach.  If frozen spinach is used, consider steaming it quickly before using it in this recipe.
* Crushed red pepper flakes to taste
* Salt to taste
* Optional: feta or feta substitute

== Procedure ==

# Boil the pasta. Bring a pan of water to a boil and once it has a good rolling boil, put in the pasta.  Start checking it about 2 minutes before the amount of time specified on the package by tasting a piece.  A commonly held ideal for pasta is that it should be &quot;al dente&quot;, which means a tiny, tiny bit undercooked, rather than soft and mushy; it does not mean raw.  Drain the pasta once it's done.)
# Simultaneously, make the sauce.
# In a cold skillet, combine the olive oil, red pepper flakes, and garlic.  Put them on medium heat.
# After a brief amount of time, add the onion slices.
# Once the onion is slightly browned, add the pecan halves and sauté them for two minutes.
# Add the spinach.  
# Once the spinach is done, add salt.
# The original recipe contained 1 cup of feta.  I've never tried it that way, but if you're adventurous, you could consider adding a feta substitute; if you do, mix it in at the end.
# Put the sauce on the drained pasta and serve.  

This recipe can be a stand-alone meal; it's also good cold as a leftover.  It sometimes turns out a bit dry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prolog is a ''declarative'' programming language. This means that in prolog, you do not write out what the computer should do line by line, as in ''procedural'' languages such as C and Java . The general idea behind declarative languages is that you describe a situation. Based on this code, the interpreter or compiler will tell you a solution. In the case of prolog, it will tell you whether a prolog sentence is true or not and, if it contains variables, what the values of the variables need to be. 

This may sound like a godsend for programmers, but the truth is that prolog is seldom used purely in this way. Though the declarative idea is the backbone of prolog, it is possible to see prolog code as procedural. A prolog programmer will generally do both depending on the part of the code he or she is reading or writing. When learning prolog however, experience in procedural programming is in no way useful. (it is often said that it is easier to learn prolog for someone who does not have any experience in procedural programming than for someone who does)

Prolog is considered a difficult language to master, especially when the student tries to rush things, mainly because of the different way of thinking the student has to adopt and amount of recursion in prolog programs. When used correctly, however, prolog can be a very powerful language.

== Why Learn Prolog? ==

Learning prolog will certainly not always be as fruitful as learning C++, Java or Python. Prolog is most useful in the areas related to Artificial Intelligence research, such as problem solving, (path) planning or natural language interpretation. Some fields that are not strictly AI, such as parser building, can also benefit greatly from prolog. 

However those that do not work with natural language systems daily can also benefit greatly from prolog. As prolog uses certain programming techniques that are considered difficult or advanced (most  notably recursion), prolog can be a great way of gaining insight into these techniques. A practised prolog programmer will certainly have an in-depth understanding of such concepts as recursion, searching problem trees and constraint logic programming. Prolog can even serve as a 'sketching' tool to try out basic programming ideas before implementing them in procedural languages.

Because of its close ties with predicate logic, learning prolog can lead to a more fluent understanding of predicate logic. (The reverse is true as well: anyone experienced in predicate logic will certainly be able to pick up prolog faster)

All in all, if you're looking to improve your resume as a webdesigner, prolog may not be the way to go. Prolog is still mainly an academic language. This doesn't mean it's purely for testing ideas or outlining techniques. Very complex programs have been written in prolog. Most of all prolog is a complex, powerful, and elegant language that can inspire great satisfaction in its users; At times inspiring immense irritation as well.

As stated before, learning prolog is not easy. Prolog doesn't work as naturally as procedural languages and therefore requires a specific way of thinking. When learning prolog it's important to take things slow and let the concepts settle before moving on. It's also advisable to use more than one text or textbook in the learning process to get multiple perspectives on a subject. As a final note, once you've mastered something tricky that wasn't explained clearly here, feel free to edit this text on Wikibooks, so that future students can learn it more easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is about using rules recursively. That is, letting a rule refer to itself. This is one of the most important mechanisms in Prolog, but it can be difficult to work with at first.

== Recursive rules ==

Consider the following program.
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
 parent(david, john).
 parent(jim, david).
 parent(steve, jim).
 parent(nathan, steve).

 grandparent(A, B) :- parent(A, X), parent(X, B).
&lt;/source&gt;
It shows a male line in a family tree, and defines with a rule when someone is someone's grandparent (if he's a parent of that person's parent). 

What if we wanted to define when someone is an ancestor of someone else? That is, a parent, grandparent, great grandparent and so on. If we would write rules for all these situations we could define ancestor(A,B) for this particular bloodline:
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
 ancestor(A,B) :- parent(A, B).
 ancestor(A,B) :- parent(A, X), parent(X, B).
 ancestor(A,B) :- parent(A, X), parent(X, Y), parent(Y, B).
 ancestor(A,B) :- parent(A, X), parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z), parent(Z,B).
&lt;/source&gt;
Clearly this is not the way to go. It's not elegant, a lot of work and most importantly, it still doesn't define ancestor properly. This may work for a bloodline with four generations, but if we were to add a fifth parent to the program, we'd need a new line for ancestor as well. What we need is a definition for ancestor that works for any line of parents, no matter how long.

To achieve this we need to think about the definition of an ancestor. In the first place, ''person P is  person C's ancestor, if P is C's parent''. Furthermore, we can say that ''person A is person C's ancestor if person A is a parent of an ancestor of C''. This doesn't sound very useful, since we use the word ancestor in its own definition, but used together with the first statement, it becomes a complete definition. 

For instance, if we were to ask ourselves if Steve is an ancestor of John, we would look at the definitions. Steve is certainly no parent of John, so that doesn't apply. Is Steve the parent of an ancestor of John? Steve is a parent of Jim, so the question becomes, is Jim an ancestor of John? Jim is a parent of David, so is David an ancestor of John? Here we can use the first definition, because David is a parent of John.

In prolog, the definition looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
 ancestor(A, B) :- parent(A, B).
 ancestor(A, B) :- parent(A, X), ancestor(X, B).
&lt;/source&gt;
The second rule is recursive; it uses ancestor to define ancestor. The first rule is called the stop predicate as it stops the predicate calling itself.

When faced with the query '''?- ancestor(steve,john).''' prolog will first try line one of the definition, but won't be able to unify parent(steve, john) with any line in the database. It will then try the second line and come up with the sub-goals '''parent(steve, X)''' and '''ancestor(X, B)'''. It can unify '''parent(steve, X)''' with '''parent(steve, jim)''', so prolog is left with the sub-goal '''ancestor(jim, john)'''. It will continue this until it's left with the subgoal ancestor(david, john) which, using the first line of the definition, is true, because parent(david, john) is true.

Prolog is very comfortable with using recursive rules. It can very easily find all ancestors of John:
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
 ?- ancestor(X, john).

 X = david ;
 X = jim ;
 X = steve ;
 X = nathan ;
 No
&lt;/source&gt;
Or all people that Nathan is an ancestor of:
&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
 ?- ancestor(nathan, X).

 X = steve ;
 X = jim ; 
 X = david ;
 X = john ;
 No
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using recursive rules ==

Using recursive rules is not without its dangers, it can lead to all kinds of loops, which will usually cause ''stack overflows'', meaning prolog has run out of memory. The following guidelines should always be kept in mind when writing recursive rules.

* '''Start with your stop predicate.'''
:Always put the non-recursive predicate before the recursive predicate. If you start with the recursive predicate prolog will try to search 'deeper' before seeing if it can stop recursing. In the example above, it wouldn't actually make a difference, but your program won't always be so clean and straight-forward.

* '''Avoid recursion on the left'''
:When writing a recursive rule, if at all possible, put the recursive rule on the right. For instance, use:

 a :- b, a. 

:instead of

 a :- a, b.

:This is the same principle as the previous guideline, let prolog evaluate non recursive goals first.  If you recurse before you've evaluated the other sub-goals, prolog could either get stuck in infinite recursions, or do a lot of unnecessary work. Sometimes it's necessary to put the recursive element on the left, but don't do it unless you know why you're doing it.

== Examples ==

*A classic example of a recursive function is the factorial function. You can see how this is implemented in the section [[Prolog/Math, Functions and Equality|Math, Functions and Equality]]. In most programming languages, you might learn recursion by writing a function fact(), which took a positive integer as input, and ''returned'' a positive integer. In Prolog, since we usually use predicates instead of functions, we will instead define a predicate fact(X,Y) which is equivalent to the statement, &quot;The factorial of X is Y.&quot; Then, to find the factorial of 7, for instance, we would use the query ?- fact(7,X). Prolog will then tell us: X=5040.

* One thing that can easily be defined recursively is a list. In this context we'll consider a list a collection of things (elements) that are placed in some order. To define this recursively, we'll state that '''a list is a single element, that is followed by a list'''. To end the recursion we need a second statement, which says that '''a list is something that consists of an element'''. Together, these two definitions exactly define anything that is a list. 
:
: Lists are actually a very common structure in prolog programs, and they're used in a recursive way. The following chapter explains how.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Typelessness does not imply strong or weakly typed==

The fact that a variable does not have type does not make a language strong or weakly typed, Lisp for example is strongly typed but the type is linked to the value not the variable. This is called dynamically  typed: type check at runtime.

C and C++ are not strongly typed: e.g. you can add integers to a pointer for example. Both these languages are called statically typed because they need to know the type at compile time.

So we have two axes: ''dynamic'' vs ''static'' which have nothing to do with ''strong'' vs ''weak''.

== Output ==
ommm, that's gonna output 
 Hello world!Hello world!Hello world!Hello world!
4 times.

could we break the example up into 4 seperate chunks of &lt;?php &lt;php code goes here&gt; ?&gt; or something to let the reader know that if he copies &amp; pastes the source, he won't get the output listed?

:Yeah, I saw that but I was too lazy to fix it.  :P  It draws out one of the problems with the code template I made, so I'm debating whether to change the template or change the page content.  I tried to keep it exactly the same as it was previously so it would be easy to remove the template.  *shrugs*  I'll have to look at it later (or someone else can fix it up).  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 08:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
::Fixed.  I broke it up into two examples. --[[User:Karl McClendon|Karl McClendon]] ([[User talk:Karl McClendon|talk]]) 14:03, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

== echo !=print ==

it's not true that echo and print behave the same - echo does not return an exit code opposite print.
so if(echo &quot;bla bla&quot;) wouldn't work, while if(print &quot;bla bla&quot;) should work as expected.
:Fixed (well more or less).  The opening statement already noted the difference, so it was just the 1 sentence at the end of the print section that needing correcting.  Thanks for pointing out the error --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 20:00, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I added a note on one of the echo examples informing the reader that commas can be used to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenate concatenate] echo output, but not print output.  If the formatting is incorrect, please tweak it.  --banzaimonkey

== Double Quotes ( &quot; ) vs. Single Quotes ( ' ) ==

I did a quick find-replace in my practice script and there doesn't seem to be a difference between using single quotes ( ' )or double quotes ( &quot; ).  Is there some difference of which I'm not aware, or is it up to user preference? --banzaimonkey

:The example should be more clear. If you use double quotes, you can inject variable contents easily. All variable start with the ''escape character'' DOLLAR_SIGN

 $topping = 'gnanendra .p';
 $order = &quot;large $topping pizza&quot;;

:This is equivalent to:

 $order = &quot;large &quot; . $topping . &quot; pizza&quot;;

:In [[Java|any sane language]], that would be:

 String topping = &quot;pepperoni&quot;;
 String order = &quot;large &quot; + topping + &quot; pizza&quot;;

:Personally, I dislike the FULL_STOP character for combining strings, so whenever I can I exploit the $ syntax. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 23:23, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

== Line Breaks ==

A good programming tip might be to add whitespace (perhaps along with an explanation of whitespace) to line breaks to increase readability.  --banzaimonkey

== Polish ==

I think its about time to do some polishing and re-structuring of this page.  I think that the hello world examples and the topics on variables and whatnot should be split up to different pages since those topics should be discussed in length. --[[User:Karl McClendon|Karl McClendon]] ([[User talk:Karl McClendon|talk]]) 22:06, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

== Nice job ==

The PHP programing is nicely written. I see I can manage it. Easy and fast to learn. Thank You! --[[Special:Contributions/147.231.138.108|147.231.138.108]] ([[User talk:147.231.138.108|talk]]) 22:06, 26 July 2010 (UTC) (user Reo On on w:)

== Incomprehensible sentence ==

I don't think the following fragment (in section [[PHP_Programming/hello_world#Real_world_analogy|Real world analogy]]) makes sense, in particular near ''code&gt;$''.

: ... and the box is represented by the code&gt;$ and how the data is stored in memory.

Do you agree? If yes, what should it be?

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is (or will be) a glossary of common Prolog terms.

;Argument
:''Definition missing''
;Arity
:The number of arguments that a predicate takes. E.g. &lt;code&gt;member(X,List)&lt;/code&gt; has arity 2. In documentation, the arity of a predicate is written as predicate/arity. E.g. &lt;code&gt;member/2&lt;/code&gt;.
;Backtracking
:If a sub-goal fails, the built-in Prolog search mechanism will go back to the parent-goal. Any variables that were instantiated in the sub-goal will be un-instantiated. Prolog will then search for a new way of satisfying the sub-goal. This process is called ''backtracking''.
;Clause
:A single clause of a relation, usually defined as Head :- Body, but see also Fact.
;Fact
:A Clause with no body, that is a Head on its own.
;Functor
:''Definition missing''
;Goal
:See ''query''.
;Ground Term
: A Term which has no logic variables in it.
;Predicate
: A set of clauses or a relation.
;Query
:''Definition missing''
;Relation
:Synonym for Predicate.
;Recursion/Recursive
:''Definition missing''
;Rule
:See clause.
;Term
:Every object in Prolog is a term, that includes variables, compounds, numbers, source code.
;Unification
:''Definition missing''
;Singleton Variable
:If a variable is named only once in a clause, usually it is replace with _.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}

Radiation Oncology is a rapidly changing field with new advances being made daily.  As a consequence, any textbook becomes out-of-date almost immediately after it is published.  Thus, the WikiBook format is ideal for a textbook of radiation oncology, as updates can be made constantly as new information becomes available.

This textbook is meant to be used by residents, medical students, and practicing physicians in radiation oncology.  

At the creation of this textbook, the emphasis was placed on keeping the content up-to-date in terms of publishing the results of major trials.  It is not meant to be an encyclopedic work.  It is impossible to include the results of all trials relating to radiation oncology.  Publishing every little detail of each and every trial would bog down this resource and make it difficult to use.  Its main purpose is to be a useful reference for those wishing to gain knowledge about clinical radiation oncology.

As it is a WikiWork, its purpose may change. 

This book is dedicated to the patients who are the inspiration to those of us involved in this field, as well as to the pioneers in radiation oncology, without whom this textbook could not exist.

If you wish to contribute to this wiki, please see the instructions to authors at the following pages:
*[[Radiation Oncology/Standards|a working list of standards]]
*[[Talk:Radiation Oncology|Talk page]].

Artichoke hearts are readily available in cans and jars in many countries, and are increasingly used in the making of snack dips. Many national chain restaurants in the USA have some variety of artichoke dip, which is usually mayonnaise-based. One of the easiest, yet unhealthy, variations on the creamy artichoke dip is jokingly called the '''Artichoke Hearts Attack''', owing to the amount of mayonnaise and Parmesan cheese it contains.

As an &quot;equal parts&quot; recipe, (with 3 simple parts), it is especially amenable to whipping up at the last minute for a party, and as it is primarily a base to which other ingredients are added, it is popular among those who like to add something distinctive.

==Ingredients==

Equal parts:
* [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]] hearts, chopped or squeezed
* [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Romano cheese]]

==Procedure==
Mix them up.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

There are many who increase the amount of artichokes used, for health-conscious reasons. There are also versions that replace the mayonnaise with soft tofu.

Various items that are often added to the base artichoke dip, (to taste):

* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]].
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]], ([[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]]).
* [[Cookbook:Dill|Dill]] weed.
* Finely chopped [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], (often with pimento).
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] are an especially common addition.
* Any number of very finely chopped [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], sometimes pre-cooked but raw is fine.
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], cooked.
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]].
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]].
* Minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]].
* Small can chopped green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]].
* [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon Mustard]] (teaspoon or tablespoon to taste).

==Serving==

At room temperature, it is perfect for the savory dipping of vegetables, potato chips, and all other common party snacks. It becomes even better, however, as a warmed-up dip. Simply place it into a small, shallow, heat-resistant dish and broil it for just a little while, until the top turns slightly tan. It can also work well as a continuously warmed dip in a fondue pot, although it does need to be stirred every once in a while to prevent burning.

Another interesting use, for those who are definitely not counting calories, is as the base for a sandwich. Spread the dip onto a good Italian roll, then broil it. When the dip turns a nice tan color, take it out of the broiler and finish the sandwich with lettuce and tomato.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Xno. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Xno~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

C0 continuity

example



Position continuity only. Curves have a kink at the C0 point and surfaces have a sharp crease along the C0 seam. Abutting curves and surfaces touch one another, but they have no curvature similarities.



C1 continuity

example



Position and tangent continuity. The edges between a ball fillet and its adjacent faces are examples of C1 continuity.



C2 continuity

example



Position, tangent, and curvature continuity. Curves and surfaces are perfectly smooth, and the curvature at the joint between two abutting curves or surfaces is equal. Consequently, the joint is seamless and invisible.

==FAQ - Detail ==
'''How do I display PCD centrelines for radial pattern holes?'''
In detail mode - Advanced, Setup, Modify Val. 
Find the entry RADIAL_PATTERN_AXIS_CIRCLE and set the value to YES 
File, Exit and repaint the screen to see changes.
Note: This only works for pattern of holes defined using the radial type holes, where the dimension type is set to diameter when created not radius.

'''How do I change the size of datum points?'''
In detail mode - Advanced, Setup, Modify Val. 
Find the entry DATUM_POINT_SIZE and set the value (value is in inches) e.g. 3 is 3 inches not 3 mm 
File, Exit and repaint the screen to see changes.

'''How do I change the shape of datum points?'''
In detail mode - Advanced, Setup, Modify Val. 
Find the entry DATUM_POINT_SIZE and set the value to one of the following CROSS, DOT, CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, or SQUARE. 
File, Exit and repaint the screen to see changes.

'''How do you blank items on layers in assemblies/parts in the drawing?'''
Assuming the assemblies use default layers or the features to blank are on layers. Create a layer in the drawing with exactly the same name. When it is blanked it will effectively blank all features on the chosen layers in all components in the assembly. 

'''How do include symbols in notes?'''
Create the note as normal at the location where the note is required type &amp;sym(name) where name is the name of the symbol. You will need retrieve the symbol so it is part of the drawing before this will work.

'''How do I create a PLUS-PLUS tolerance?'''
Use Modify, Value pick the negative tolerance and add a minus sign in front of the value e.g 0.2 becomes -0.2 hit enter and Pro/Engineer will now show a plus-plus tolerance. This is because Pro/Engineer stores the integer as a positive value and applies a negative value to it, making the tolerance value negative creates a positive (two negatives = a positive).

'''What are the curly brackets that appear when editing notes?'''
A typical note will appear as below when editing

{0: First line of note}

{1: Second line of note}

The brackets and number control the text formatting. If you delete the number or the colon then the text line will return to default text formatting values.

:''Main article: [[Wikipedia:Einstein's field equation|Einstein's field equation]]''

The '''Einstein field equation''' or '''Einstein equation''' is a dynamical equation which describes how matter and energy change the geometry of spacetime, this curved geometry being interpreted as the [[Wikipedia:gravitational field|gravitational field]] of the matter source. The motion of objects (with a mass much smaller than the matter source) in this gravitational field is described very accurately by the [[Wikipedia:geodesic equation|geodesic equation]]. 

==Mathematical form of Einstein's field equation==

Einstein's field equation (EFE) is usually written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu} - {1 \over 2} {R g_{\mu\nu}} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi {G \over c^4} T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Where 

* &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wikipedia:Ricci tensor|Ricci curvature tensor]]
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wikipedia:Ricci scalar|Ricci scalar]] (the [[Wikipedia:tensor contraction|tensor contraction]] of the Ricci tensor)
* &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is a (symmetric 4 x 4) [[Wikipedia:metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wikipedia:Cosmological constant|Cosmological constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Wikipedia:pi|pi]]=3.1415..., the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wikipedia:Gravitational constant|Gravitational constant]]
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wikipedia:speed of light|speed of light]] in [[Wikipedia:free space|free space]]
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy-momentum [[Wikipedia: stress tensor|stress tensor]] of matter

The EFE equation is a tensor equation relating a set of [[Wikipedia:symmetric tensor|symmetric 4 x 4 tensor]]s. It is written here in terms of components. Each tensor has 10 independent components.  Given the freedom of choice of the four spacetime coordinates, the independent equations reduce to 6 in number.

The EFE is understood to be an equation for the metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; (given a specified distribution of matter and energy in the form of a stress-energy tensor). Despite the simple appearance of the equation it is, in fact, quite complicated. This is because both the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar depend on the metric in a complicated nonlinear manner. 

One can write the EFE in a more compact form by defining the [[Wikipedia:Einstein tensor|Einstein tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} + (\Lambda - {1 \over 2}R) g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
which is a symmetric second-rank tensor that is a function of the metric. Working in [[Wikipedia:geometrized units|geometrized units]] where ''G'' = ''c'' = 1, the EFE can then be written as

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the left represents the curvature of spacetime as determined by the metric and the expression on the right represents the matter/energy content of spacetime. The EFE can then be interpreted as a set of equations dictating how the curvature of spacetime is related to the matter/energy content of the universe.

These equations, together with the geodesic equation, form the core of the mathematical formulation of General Relativity.

==Properties of Einstein's equation==

===Conservation of energy and momentum===

An important consequence of the EFE is the local conservation of energy and momentum; this result arises by using the [[Wikipedia:curvature tensor|differential Bianchi identity]] to obtain 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_b G^{\mu\nu}=G^{\mu\nu}{}_{;b}=0&lt;/math&gt;

which, by using the EFE, results in

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_b T^{\mu\nu}= T^{\mu\nu}{}_{;b}=0&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses the local conservation law referred to above. 

===Nonlinearity of the field equations===

The EFE are a set of 10 coupled elliptic-hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equations for the metric components. This nonlinear feature of the dynamical equations distinguishes general relativity from other physical theories.

For example, [[Wikipedia:Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]] of [[Wikipedia:electromagnetism|electromagnetism]] are linear in the electric and magnetic fields (i.e. the sum of two solutions is also a solution).

Another example is [[Wikipedia:Schrodinger's equation|Schrodinger's equation]] of [[Wikipedia:quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] where the equation is linear in the wavefunction.

===The correspondence principle===

Einstein's equation reduces to [[Wikipedia:Newton's law of gravity|Newton's law of gravity]] by using both the [[Wikipedia:weak-field approximation|weak-field approximation]] and the [[Wikipedia:slow-motion approximation|slow-motion approximation]]. In fact, the gravitational constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the EFE's is determined by making these two approximations.

==The cosmological constant==

The [[Wikipedia:cosmological constant|cosmological constant]] term &lt;math&gt;\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; was originally introduced by Einstein to allow for a static universe (i.e., one that is not expanding or contracting). This effort was unsuccessful for two reasons: the static universe described by this theory was unstable, and observations of distant galaxies by [[Wikipedia:Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] a decade later confirmed that our universe is in fact not static but expanding. So &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; was abandoned (set to 0), with Einstein calling it the &quot;biggest blunder he ever made&quot;.

Despite Einstein's misguided motivation for introducting the cosmological constant term, there is nothing wrong (i.e. inconsistent) with the presence of such a term in the equations. Indeed, quite recently, improved astronomical techniques have found that a non-zero value of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is needed to explain some observations.

Einstein thought of the cosmological constant as an independent parameter, but its term in the field equation can also be moved algebraically to the other side, written as part of the stress-energy tensor:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{(vac)}} = -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi}g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
The constant
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\mathrm{vac}} = \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
is called the ''[[Wikipedia:vacuum energy|vacuum energy]]''. The existence of a cosmological constant is equivalent to the existence of a non-zero vacuum energy. The terms are now used interchangeably in general relativity.

==Solutions of the field equations==

The '''solutions of the Einstein field equations''' are [[Wikipedia:metric tensor (general relativity)|metrics]] of spacetime.  The solutions are hence often called 'metrics'. These metrics describe the structure of the spacetime including the inertial motion of objects in the spacetime.  As the field equations are non-linear, they cannot always be completely solved (i.e. without making approximations).  For example, there is no known complete solution for a spacetime with two massive bodies in it (which is a theoretical model of a binary star system, for example). However, approximations are usually made in these cases. These are commonly referred to as [[Wikipedia:post Newtonian approximations|post Newtonian approximations]]. Even so, there are numerous cases where the field equations have been solved completely, and those are called [[wikipedia:exact solutions|exact solutions]]. 

The study of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations is one of the activities of [[Wikipedia:cosmology|cosmology]]. It leads to the prediction of [[Wikipedia:black hole|black holes]] and to different models of evolution of the universe.

==Vacuum field equations==

If the energy-momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is zero in the region under consideration, then the field equations are also referred to as the '''vacuum field equations''', which can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ab} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions to the vacuum field equations are called '''vacuum solutions'''. Flat [[Wikipedia:Minkowski space|Minkowski space]] is the simplest example of a vacuum solution. Nontrivial examples include the [[Wikipedia:Schwarzschild solution|Schwarzschild solution]] and the [[Wikipedia:Kerr solution|Kerr solution]].

The above vacuum equation assumes that the cosmological constant is zero. If it is taken to be nonzero then the vacuum equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu} = \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematicians usually refer to manifolds with a vanishing Ricci tensor as [[wikipedia:Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci-flat manifold]]s and manifolds with a Ricci tensor proportional to the metric as [[wikipedia:Einstein manifold|Einstein manifold]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Johannes Kepler was a mathematician who attempted to derive a set of fundamental principles which would explain the motions of the planets. He believed in the heliocentric view of the solar system proposed by Copernicus, and he also possessed a rich set of observations of the planets made by Tycho Brahe.

After twenty years of painstaking attempts and various discarded ideas based on geometry, he finally arrived at a mathematical model of orbital motions based on the ellipse. Kepler summarized his findings in the form of three laws of planetary motion, frequently referred to as Kepler's First, Second and Third Laws, respectively:

* '''Kepler's First Law''', also known as '''The Law of Ellipses''' &amp;mdash; The orbits of the planets are ellipses, with the sun at one focus.
* '''Kepler's Second Law''', or '''The Law of Equal Areas in Equal Time''' &amp;mdash; The line between a planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in the plane of the planet's orbit over equal times.
* '''Kepler's Third Law''', or '''The Law of Harmony''' &amp;mdash;The time required for a planet to orbit the sun, called its period, is proportional to half the long axis of the ellipse raised to the 3/2 power. The constant of proportionality is the same for all the planets. It is often called the Law of Harmony because it shows a harmonic relation between distances and periods.

At that time he developed these laws, there was not yet a developed theory of gravity capable of explaining why the planets moved as they were observed to. Later, Isaac Newton, using his universal inverse-square law theory of gravity, was able to show how Kepler's Laws fit into a scientific theory of celestial mechanics.

==Elliptical orbits==
An ellipse is a shape formed by taking a diagonal slice through a cone. It is essentially the shape of a circle viewed at an angle.

An ellipse can be drawn by taking a piece of paper, two push-pins, a loop of string, and a pencil. The two pins are pushed through the paper into a suitable surface, providing the two foci for the ellipse. They should be closer together than the loop is long. The loop of string is placed around the base of these pins, leaving some slack. The pencil is now placed so that the pins and the loop form a triangle with a slight tension on the string.

Now try to draw a shape by moving the pencil about the pins while keeping the string taunt. The result should be an ellipse. The shape of the ellipse can be varied either by moving the pins closer together or further apart. This shape, according to Kepler, defines the path that a planet takes when it orbits the Sun.

Kepler's Second Law says in brief that an object speeds up as it gets closer to the Sun and slows down as it moves further away. Where the distance from the Sun to the orbital path is longer, only a smaller arc needs to be traversed to sweep out an area that requires a wider arc near the Sun.

As the planet moves closer to the Sun along its orbit the gravitational force works to increase the velocity. In contrast, as the planet is moving further away, the gravity of the Sun gradually decelerates the body and it is slowed down.

A line that divides an ellipse in half and passes through the widest part of the ellipse is called the major axis. A line perpendicular to this axis and dividing the ellipse in half is called the minor axis. Half the length of the major axis is called the semi-major axis, and is represented by ''a''. The period required for a planet to complete one full orbit is represented by ''P''. The relationship between the period ''P'' and the length of the semimajor axis ''a'' is known as Kepler's Third Law, and can be represented as follows:


:&lt;math&gt;P^2 \propto a^3&lt;/math&gt;


where the symbol &amp;prop; means &quot;proportional to&quot;, and implies that there is a direct mathematical relationship between the period squared and the length of the semi-major axis cubed.  

The Second and Third Laws provide a basis for calculating the period of any planet orbiting the Sun, as well as determining where the planet will be located along the orbital path.

==Eccentricity and Orbital Paths==

The ratio of the distance of a focus from the center of an ellipse to the semi-major axis is called the ''eccentricity'' of the orbit. When the two foci of the ellipse are on top of each other, the eccentricity is exactly 0.0 and the shape is a circle. As the eccentricity increases, the orbiting planet moves much further away than at the closest approach. The orbital eccentricities for planets in our Solar system vary from as much as 0.21 for Mercury down to 0.0068 for Venus. 

The scientific name for the point of closest approach is the '''periapsis''', while the most distance separation is the '''apoapsis'''. In the case of planets orbiting the Sun, these are called the '''perihelion''' and '''aphelion''', respectively. (The ''-helion'' suffix comes from the Greek name for the Sun deity, Helios. This word is also the source of the name for the element Helium.)

|''Two elliptical orbits with the same major axis'' '''a''' ''but different eccentricity.''
|}

Perhaps the most counter-intuitive aspect of the Third Law is that for any two identical bodies orbiting the Sun with the same semi-major axis, the orbital period is the same. This is true even if one is orbiting in a perfect circle and the other has an orbit that is highly elliptical (has a relatively high eccentricity). The elliptical shape will fit entirely within the circle except at two points (the ends of the major axis, at which the two curves will be tangent), so it is actually a shorter orbital path. However the aphelion of the ellipse will be located further from the Sun, so the planet will spend more time traversing the distant section of the orbit. The shorter orbit and the slower traverse of the aphelion compensate for each other, resulting in an identical period with the circular orbit.

==Some Examples Using Kepler's Third Law==

Originally, Kepler's Third Law was used to describe the motions of the planets around the Sun. As it turns out, it also works very well with regards to other two-body orbital systems like the orbits of moons around Jupiter, or the orbits of binary stars about the center of mass of their system. In all of these cases the period of the orbit squared is proportional to the length of the semi-major axis cubed, with the differences between the orbital systems reflected in the constant of proportionality.

In this section we will consider the special case of the planets going around the Sun. If we choose to measure the length of the semi-major axis of an orbit in astronomical units (abbreviated AU, where 1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun) and we measure the orbital period in years (abbreviated as y), then we can express Kepler's Third Law as

:&lt;math&gt;P^2 = ({{y^2}\over {AU}^3}) a^3&lt;/math&gt;


where ''P'' is measured in years and ''a'' is measured in astronomical units. What follows are a few example of how to use this equation.

===Mars' Orbital Period===

Repeated measurements of Mars' orbit have determined that the semi-major axis of its orbit has a length of 1.52 AU. How long does it take for Mars to orbit the Sun once?

''Solution'': In this question, we are being asked for the orbital period ''P'' of Mars. We know from reading the question that the length of the semi-major axis ''a'' is 1.52 AU. Solving Kepler's Third Law for the period gives us

:&lt;math&gt;P = ({{y}\over {AU}^{3\over 2}})a^{3\over 2} = ({{y}\over {AU}^{3\over 2}})(1.52 AU)^{3\over 2} = 1.87 y&lt;/math&gt;

which tells us that it takes 1.87 years for Mars to go around the Sun once.

===An Unknown Asteroid's Orbital Semi-Major Axis===

An amateur astronomer spends several months tracking an asteroid, and is able to determine that it takes approximately 3/4 of a year for it to orbit once around the Sun. What is the semi-major axis of this asteroid's orbit?

''Solution'': Reading the question tells us that the orbital period of the asteroid is 3/4 of a year, or 0.75 y. We are expected to find the length of the semi-major axis ''a'', so we need to solve Kepler's Third Law for that. Doing so gives us

:&lt;math&gt;a = ({{AU}\over {y}^{2\over 3}})P^{2\over 3} = ({{AU}\over {y}^{2\over 3}})(0.75 y)^{2\over 3} = 0.83 AU&lt;/math&gt;

which means that is has a semi-major axis somewhere between that of Venus' orbit and Earth's orbit.

Every day, the Earth turns once on its axis. At the Earth's equator, we move around the center of the Earth with speeds near a thousand kilometers per hour because of this rotation. We feel nothing, but we can see the effect of Earth's rotation. An observer on Earth sees everything in the sky appear to rotate around Earth at the rate of once per day. This motion is not apparent to an observer who steps outside for a moment, since it is so slow. For the motion to become apparent, an observer must watch the sky for a period of hours. During the day, the motion manifests itself in the movement of the Sun, which proceeds from the East in the morning towards the west in the evening. At night, the constellations move, seeming to circle about the pole.

Because the daily motion of the stars is driven by the same mechanism that drives the motion of the Sun, the stars move in almost exactly the same way that the Sun moves. Indeed, everything in the sky moves in almost exactly the same way over the course of a day. The motion of the Sun and the planets only differ at all because the planets have their own motion around the Sun along their orbits, and is noticeable from Earth. 

As the Earth spins, it appears to us that the celestial sphere is spinning. It spins about the Earth's pole, so that the celestial poles appear stationary and the stars and planets seem to move in circles around the poles. Stars move at 15&amp;deg; an hour.

The schematic illustrates the daily motion of the celestial sphere resulting from the spin of the Earth. The Sun, Moon, planets and stars make circles around the Earth. Since the observer is tilted with respect to Earth's rotation axis, the daily motion also appears tilted. As a result, celestial objects appear to rise and set at an angle.

Looking at the diagram, we see that stars should rise roughly in the East and come up at an angle. In the Northern Hemisphere, the stars move to the south as they rise, while stars move northward in the Southern Hemisphere as they rise. To an observer standing at the equator, the axis of rotation is horizontal, and stars rise in the East perpendicular to the horizon.

Since the stars seem to rotate around the celestial pole, some of the stars very near the pole never rise or set. Certainly, Polaris never sets &amp;mdash; it remains fixed. Only an observer very close to the equator will see any of the stars in the Little Dipper rise or set. The stars close enough to the pole never seen to rise or set are called '''circumpolar stars'''. These stars always remain above an observer's horizon. Different stars are circumpolar to different observers.

Imagine standing at the North Pole. You would see Polaris overhead with all the other stars spinning around it. In reality, you are the one who is spinning. From the North Pole, all of the motion of the stars is horizontal. Stars at the horizon skim along the horizon, never rising or setting. The stars higher in the sky also move horizontally, never moving up or down. From the poles, ''all'' visible stars are circumpolar.

At the Earth's equator, the situation is different. The celestial poles appear at the horizon on the north and south points. As stars move around the poles, they ''all'' rise and set, no matter how close to the pole they are. From here, there are no circumpolar stars. As you move from the equator to the pole, you will see gradually more and more stars become circumpolar, until on finally reaching the pole you find that all stars are circumpolar.

For centuries, the day has been the most fundamental unit of time in the calendar. Measuring the passage of days is as easy as counting sunrises or sunsets. The earliest clocks, the predecessors to the sundial, worked by tracking the daily motion of the Sun across the sky.

A sundial uses the position of the Sun to give the time. (The gnomon of a sundial can be used to find north: the shortest shadow cast by the sun (at noon) points north.) Of course, not all clocks work by measuring the Sun, although all work by measuring some reliably periodic and regular process. A wristwatch, for example, measures the oscillations of a quartz crystal. Atomic clocks use the natural period of oscillation of cesium atoms to measure time. Other systems of time are tied to the motion of the Earth, but there are a variety of ways to measure time in this way. The time measured by any particular method is not guaranteed to agree with the time measured by another, so it is sometimes necessary to convert between different &quot;kinds&quot; of time.

The time measured by sundials is called '''local solar time'''. The local solar time progresses according to the Sun's motion around the Earth. Since the Earth's speed in its orbit around the Sun changes slightly over the course of a year, this motion is not completely uniform. Sometimes, when the Earth is moving faster in its orbit, the solar day is shorter. Early timekeepers never noticed this slight difference, but the appearance of accurate mechanical clocks made it possible to measure the small changes in the length of the day.

To deal with this problem, astronomers invented '''mean solar time'''. The mean solar time averaged the length of the day so that each day was of the same length. This standard is up to fifteen minutes off from the true solar time, but is much more convenient for clocks that are accurate enough to see the difference. Over the course of a year, the local solar time drifts, but the two always agree after a full year has passed.

For much of history, every town in the world kept a slightly different &quot;correct time&quot; from every other town. Under local solar time, noon occurs at the moment the Sun passes through the observer's meridian. Two observers in different locations will observe local noon to occur at different times. This is why local solar time is called &quot;local.&quot; This difference wasn't a problem when transportation and communication were slow, but the advance of trains and telegraphs made even a small difference between nearby towns important. To deal with this, the time zones were developed. The standard time was defined to be the time at a nearby line of longitude. For most locations, the time zone was offset by an round number of hours from the time measured at Earth's prime meridian.

For historical reasons, the prime meridian is based on the line of longitude through the observatory in Greenwich, England.  That time zone is known as Greenwich Mean Time, and is often used as a standard for when one wishes to compare times without taking local time zones into account.  For this reason (since it is used universally) it is also called Universal Time. This is the most commonly used form of solar time, and the most commonly used measure of time in general.

It's very natural to use the Sun as a standard of time, since the cycles of day and night are so important to life on Earth. For this reason, most people think of a day as the time it takes the Sun to move through the sky once. The apparent motion of the Sun in the sky is similar to the motion of everything else, but not exactly the same. The daily motion is driven almost entirely by the rotation of the Earth, but the Sun's motion differs from the stars' motion. This happens because the Earth is moving around the Sun. The Earth moves a little in its orbit while a it rotates and day passes.  Because the Earth's position has changed, a full rotation doesn't quite bring the Sun all the way around the sky. This means that the Earth makes a little more than a full rotation over the course of a solar day.

A '''sidereal day''' is the amount of time it takes for the stars to go once around the sky, equal to 23 hours and 56 minutes. The word ''sidereal'' means &quot;relating to the stars.&quot; The difference in length between the solar and sidereal day causes the rising and setting times of stars to change throughout the year. If the star Rigel, for example, rises at noon today, it will rise at 11:56 tomorrow. In six months, it will rise at midnight. Because the difference between solar days is tied to the orbit of the Earth, there is exactly one more sidereal day in a year than there are solar days.

[[Image: The_Moon_Luc_Viatour.jpg|left|thumb|140px]]

A '''sidereal month''' is the period of the moon in relation to the stars; approximately 27 (1/3) days (13 degrees a day). Ancient peoples used this period to track time, as evidenced by the Big Horn Medicine Wheel in Sheridan, Wyoming.

Sidereal time is widely used in astronomy because it can be used to tell which stars will be up. At a given sidereal time, the stars in the sky will always be the same. Accurately finding the position of stars is easier than finding the position of the Sun, so measurements of the solar time are usually based indirectly on the sidereal time. Modern techniques measure time from atomic clocks, which are then tied to the motion of the Earth by measurement of the sidereal time.

A '''synodic month''' is one new moon to the next; approximately 29.5 days. This is about two days longer than the sidereal month. The reason for this is that while the Moon is orbiting the Earth, the Earth is orbiting the Sun. Therefore, the Moon has to travel more than 360 degrees to return to its original position above the same meridian on the Earth.

For anyone living on the coast, tides play an important role in everyday life. Despite this, the cause of the tides was a mystery for centuries, before gravity was well understood. People have always suspected that tides are related to the moon, since high tides always occur when the Moon is highest in the sky and again when the Moon is lowest below the horizon. This turns out to be correct.

Tides occur because the gravitational pull from the Moon is greater on the side of the Earth facing the Moon than on the side facing away. As a result, the gravitational pull &quot;stretches&quot; the Earth. The tidal pull from the Moon gives the Earth an oblong shape. The pull affects the ocean more strongly than the ground, because the ocean is liquid and less resistant to movement.

The stretching effect from the tides creates two places on Earth where the tides are high, with one high tide on the side of the Earth facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite the Moon. As the Earth rotates, the locations under the positions of high tides also move. If the moon didn't orbit around the Earth, high tide would occur exactly twice a day, every 12 hours. The orbit of the moon changes the position of the high tides over the course of the month, which lengthens the time between high tides to about 12½ hours.

The Sun also has a tidal influence on the Earth, although this is a much smaller effect than the Moon's tidal influence. Because of the difference in the gravitational pull from the Sun on opposite sides of the Earth is much smaller, the Sun's tendency to make the Earth bulge is much less. Still, the contribution to tides from the Sun is noticeable. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned, the Sun adds to the Moon's tidal pull, making the tides greater. This is called the '''spring tide'''. (The spring tide has no connection with the season of spring.) When the Moon is at a right angle with the Sun, the Sun's tidal pull interferes with the Moon's, making the tides weaker. This configuration is called the '''neap tide'''.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The new features and upgrades included into Java changed the face of programming environment and gave a new definition to [[Object Oriented Programming]] (''OOP'' in short). But unlike its predecessors, Java needed to be bundled with standard functionality and be independent of the host platform.

The primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
* It is simple.
* It is object-oriented.
* It is independent of the host platform.
* It contains language facilities and libraries for networking.
* It is designed to execute code from remote sources securely.
The Java language introduces some new features that did not exist in other languages like C and C++.

== Object orientation ==
[[Image:KP-UML-Generalization-20060325.svg|300px|thumb|Object oriented programming can be represented with [[Introduction to Software Engineering/UML|UML]] diagrams.]]
Object orientation (&quot;OO&quot;), refers to a method of programming and language technique. The main idea of OO is to design software around the &quot;things&quot; (i.e. objects) it manipulates, rather than the actions it performs.

As the hardware of the computer advanced, it brought about the need to create better software techniques to be able to create ever increasing complex applications.
The intent is to make large software projects easier to manage, thus improving quality and reducing the number of failed projects.
Object oriented solution is the latest software technique.

; Assembly languages : Software techniques started with the assembly languages, that was close to machine instruction and was easy to convert into executable code. Each hardware had its own assembly language. Assembly language contains low level instructions like move data from memory to hardware registers, do arithmetic operations, and move data back to memory. Programmers had to know the detailed architecture of the computer in order to write programs.

; Procedural languages : After the assembly languages, high level languages were developed. Here the language compiler is used to convert the high level program to machine instructions, freeing up the programmers the burden of knowing the computer hardware architecture. To promote the re-use of code, and to minimize the use of GOTO instruction, &quot;procedural&quot; techniques were introduced. This simplified the creation and maintenance of software control flow, but they left out the organization of data. It became a nightmare to debug and maintain programs having many global variables.  Global variables contain data that can be modified anywhere in the application.

; Object oriented languages : In OO languages, data is taken seriously with information hiding. Procedures were replaced by Objects. Objects contain data as well as control flow. Our thinking has to shift from procedures to interaction between objects.

== Platform dependence ==
In C or C++ programming, you start to write a source code:
{{Clr}}
[[File:Gnome-mime-text-x-c.svg|50px]]
{{Clr}}

... you compile it to a machine code file:
{{Clr}}
[[File:Gnome-mime-text-x-c.svg|50px]]
[[File:Gnome-mime-application-x-executable.svg|50px]]
{{Clr}}

... and then you execute it:
{{Clr}}
[[File:Gnome-mime-text-x-c.svg|50px]]
[[File:Gnome-mime-application-x-executable.svg|50px]]
[[File:Window Dialog.svg|50px]]
{{Clr}}

In this situation, the machine code file and its execution are specific to the platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, ...) it was compiled for, that is to say to the ''targeted platform'':
{|
|
[[File:Gnome-mime-text-x-c.svg|50px]]
| style=&quot;border: 2px solid red;&quot; |
[[File:Gnome-mime-application-x-executable.svg|50px]][[File:Window Dialog.svg|50px]]
|}
{{Clr}}

... because the compiled file is a machine code file designed to work on a specific platform and hardware. It would have produced a different results/output for another platform. So if you want your program to run on several platforms, you have to compile your program several times:
{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Gnome-mime-text-x-c.svg|50px]]
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Gnome-mime-application-x-executable.svg|50px]][[File:Gnome-mime-application-x-executable.svg|50px]][[File:Gnome-mime-application-x-executable.svg|50px]]
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Windows icon.svg|50px]][[File:Apple Logo.svg|50px]][[File:Tux-shaded.svg|50px]]
|}

It poses greater vulnerability risks. Note here that when a certain code is compiled into an executable format, the executable cannot be changed dynamically. It would need to be recompiled from the changed code for the changes to be reflected in the finished executable. '''Modularity''' (dividing code into modules) is ''not'' present in Java's predecessors. If instead of a single executable, the output application was in the form of modules, one could easily change a single module and review changes in the application. In C/C++ on the other hand, a slight change in code required the whole application to be recompiled.

The idea of Java is to compile the source code into an intermediate language that will be interpreted.
{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|
[[File:Text-x-java-source.svg|50px|center]]
|
[[File:Application-x-executable.svg|50px|center]]
|
[[File:Java.png|50px|center]]
|-
|The source code
|The intermediate file
|The interpretor
|}

The intermediate language is the ''byte code''. The interpretor is the ''Java Virtual Machine'' (JVM). The byte code file is universal and the JVM is platform specific:
{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Text-x-java-source.svg|50px]]
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Application-x-executable.svg|50px]]
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Java.png|50px]][[File:Java.png|50px]][[File:Java.png|50px]]
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|
[[File:Windows icon.svg|50px]][[File:Apple Logo.svg|50px]][[File:Tux-shaded.svg|50px]]
|}

So a JVM should be coded for each platform. And that's the case. So you just have to generate a unique byte code file (a &lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt; file).

The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. Since Java 1.2, Java VM produces programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.

The first of these is to simply compile directly into native code like a more traditional compiler, skipping bytecode entirely. This achieves great performance, but at the expense of portability. This is not really used any more.

Another technique, the ''just-in-time'' (JIT) compiler, compiles the Java bytecode into native code at the time the program is run, and keep the compiled code to be used again and again.  More sophisticated VMs even use ''dynamic recompilation'', in which the VM can analyze the behavior of the running program and selectively recompile and optimize critical parts of the program.  Both of these techniques allow the program to take advantage of the speed of native code without losing portability.

Portability is a technically difficult goal to achieve, and Java's success at that goal is a matter of some controversy.  Although it is indeed possible to write programs for the Java platform that behave consistently across many host platforms, the large number of available platforms with small errors or inconsistencies led some to parody Sun's &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; slogan as &quot;Write once, debug everywhere&quot;.

== Standardization ==
C++ was built atop the C language and as a result divergent ways of doing the same thing manifested around the language. For instance, creating an object could be done in three different ways in C++. Furthermore, C++ did not come with a standard library bundled with its compilers. Instead, it relied on resources created by other programmers; code which rarely fit together.

In Java, standardized libraries are provided to allow access to features of the host machines (such as graphics and networking) in unified ways. The Java language also includes support for multi-threaded programs&amp;mdash;a necessity for many networking applications.

Platform independent Java is, however, very successful with server side applications, such as web services, servlets, or Enterprise JavaBeans.

[[Image:Gui-widgets.png|300px|thumb|Swing does not rely on the underlying native user interface.]]
Java also made progress on the client side, first it had [[w:Abstract Window Toolkit|Abstract Window Toolkit]] (AWT), then [[Java Swings|Swing]], and the most recent client side library is the [[w:Standard Widget Toolkit|Standard Widget Toolkit]] (SWT).
It is interesting to see how they tried to handle the two opposing consuming forces. Those are :

; Efficient, fast code; port to most popular hardware (write once, test anywhere) : Use the underlying native subroutine to create a GUI component. This approach was taken by AWT, and SWT.

; Portability to any hardware where JVM ported (write once, run anywhere) : To achieve this to the latter, the Java toolkit should not rely on the underlying native user interface. Swing tooks this approach.

It is interesting to see how the approach was switched back and forth. AWT → Swing → SWT.

== Secure execution ==
[[Image:FreeBSD kernel panic.png|300px|thumb|The segmentation fault, one of the most recurrent issues in C programming.]]
With the high-level of control built into the language to manipulate hardware, a C/C++ programmer could access almost any resource, either hardware or software on the system. This was intended to be one of the languages' strong points, but this very flexibility led to confusion and complex programming practices.

== Error handling ==
The old way of error handling was to let each function return an error code then let the caller check what was returned. The problem with this method was that if the return code was full of error-checking codes, this got in the way of the original one that was doing the actual work, which in turn did not make it very readable.

In the new way of error handling, functions/methods do not return error codes. Instead, when there is an error, an [[Java Programming/Exceptions|exception]] is thrown. The exceptions can be handled by the {{java:catch}} keyword at the end of a {{java:try}} block.  This way, the code that is calling the function does not need to be mangled with error checking codes, thus making the code more readable. This new way of error handling is called ''Exception handling''.

Exception handling was also added to C++. However, there are two differences between Java and C++ Exception handling:
* In Java, the exception that is thrown is a Java object like any other object in Java. It only has to implement &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; interface.
* In Java, the compiler checks whether an exception may be caught or not. The compiler gives an error if there is no catch block for a thrown exception.

The optional exception handling in the Java predecessors leads the developers not to care about the error handling. As a consequence, unexpected errors often occur. Java forces the developers to handle exceptions. The programmer must handle exception or declare that the user must handle it. Someone must handle it.

== Networking capabilities ==
However powerful, the predecessors of Java lacked a standard feature to network with other computers, and usually relied on the platforms' intricate networking capabilities. With almost all network protocols being standardized, the creators of Java technology wanted this to be a flagship feature of the language while keeping true to the spirit of earlier advances made towards standardizing [[w:Remote procedure call|Remote Procedure Call]]. Another feature that the Java team focused on was its integration in the World Wide Web and the Internet.

The Java platform was one of the first systems to provide wide support for the execution of code from remote sources. The Java language was designed with [[w:Network computing|network computing]] in mind.

An applet could run within a user's browser, executing code downloaded from a remote HTTP server. The remote code runs in a highly restricted &quot;sandbox&quot;, which protects the user from misbehaving or malicious code; publishers could apply for a certificate that they could use to digitally sign applets as &quot;safe&quot;, giving them permission to break out of the sandbox and access the local file system and network, presumably under user control.

== Dynamic class loading ==
In conventional languages like C and C++, all code had to be compiled and linked to one executable program, before execution. In Java, classes are compiled as needed. If a class is not needed during an execution phase, that class is not even compiled into byte code.

This feature comes in handy especially in network programming when we do not know, beforehand, what code will be executed. A running program could load classes from the file system or from a remote server.

Also this feature makes it theoretically possible for a Java program to alter its own code during execution, in order to do some self-learning behavior. It would be more realistic to imagine, however, that a Java program would generate Java code before execution, and then, that code would be executed. With some feedback mechanism, the generated code could improve over time.

== Automatic memory garbage collection ==
In conventional languages like C and C++, the programmer has to make sure that all memory that was allocated is freed. Memory leaks became a regular nuisance in instances where the programmers had to manually allocate the system's memory resources.

Memory resources or buffers have specific modes of operation for optimal performance. Once a buffer is filled with data, it needs to be cleaned up after there is no further use for its content. If a programmer forgets to clean it in his/her code, the memory is easily overloaded. Programming in C/C++ languages became tedious and unsafe because of these very quirks, and programs built in these languages were prone to memory leakages and sudden system crashes &amp;mdash; sometimes even harming the hardware itself. Freeing memory is particularly important in servers, since it has to run without stopping for days. If a piece of memory is not freed after use and the server just keeps allocating memory, that memory leak can take down the server.

In Java, freeing up memory is taken out of the programmers hands; the Java Virtual Machine keeps track of all used memory. When memory is not used any more it is automatically freed up. A separate task is running in the background by the JVM, freeing up unreferenced, unused memory. That task is called the ''Garbage Collector''.

The Garbage Collector is always running. This automatic memory garbage collection feature makes it easy to write robust server side programs in Java. The only thing the programmer has to watch for is the speed of object creation. If the application is creating objects faster than the Garbage Collector can free them, it can cause memory problems. Depending on how the JVM is configured, the application either can run out of memory by throwing the &lt;code&gt;NotEnoughMemoryException&lt;/code&gt;, or can halt to give time for the Garbage Collector to do its job.

== Applet ==
The Java creators created the concept of the ''applet''. A Java program can be run in a client browser program. Java was released in 1995; the time when the Internet was becoming more available and familiar to the general public. The promise of Java was in the client browser-side in that code would be downloaded and executed as a Java applet in the client browser program.

:''See also [[Java Programming/Applets]].''

== Forbidden bad practices ==
Over the years, some features in C/C++ programming became abused by the programmers. Although the language allows it, it was known as bad practices. So the creators of Java have disabled them:
* Operator overloading
* Multiple inheritance
* Friend classes (access another object's private members)
* Restrictions of explicit type casting (related to memory management)

== Evaluation ==
In most people's opinions, Java technology delivers reasonably well on all these goals. The language is not, however, without drawbacks. Java tends to be more high-level than similar languages (such as C++), which means that the Java language lacks features such as hardware-specific data types, low-level pointers to arbitrary memory addresses, or programming methods like operator overloading. Although these features are frequently abused or misused by programmers, they are also powerful tools. However, Java technology includes [[Java Programming/Java Native Interface|Java Native Interface]] (JNI), a way to call native code from Java language code. With JNI, it is still possible to use some of these features.

Some programmers also complain about its lack of multiple inheritance, a powerful feature of several object-oriented languages, among others C++. The Java language separates inheritance of type and implementation, allowing inheritance of multiple type definitions through interfaces, but only single inheritance of type implementation via class hierarchies. This allows most of the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding many of its dangers. In addition, through the use of concrete classes, abstract classes, as well as interfaces, a Java language programmer has the option of choosing full, partial, or zero implementation for the object type he defines, thus ensuring maximum flexibility in application design.

There are some who believe that for certain projects, object orientation makes work harder instead of easier. This particular complaint is not unique to the Java language but applies to other object-oriented languages as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diffie-Hellman''', named for creators Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, was the first (publicly known, at least) public key algorithm and was published in 1976. Its security relies on the discrete logarithm problem, which is still thought to be difficult. 

Diffie-Hellman is generally used to generate a unique key by two (or more) parties with which they may then encrypt and exchange another key. This is similar to the use of the [[../RSA/]] algorithm within PGP. 

Alice and Bob select a large prime number ''n'', which will be the modulus. They then select another number ''c'' that is primitive ''mod n'', which will be the base. These two numbers may be broadcast far and wide. At this point Bob and Alice both select large, random integers (''a'' and ''b'', respectively) in secret, and exchange the result of the exponentiation:


Alice performs &lt;math&gt;A=c^a mod\ n&lt;/math&gt; and sends ''A'' to Bob in the clear.


Bob then performs &lt;math&gt;B=c^b mod\ n&lt;/math&gt; and sends ''B'' to Alice in the clear.


At which point Alice knows a and B, so she computes:

&lt;math&gt;K_2=B^a\ mod\ n&lt;/math&gt;

while Bob, knowing A and b, computes:

&lt;math&gt;K_1=A^b\ mod\ n&lt;/math&gt;

and,

&lt;math&gt;K_1\ =\ K_2&lt;/math&gt;


This is simply based on the commutative property of multiple exponents 

&lt;math&gt;(x^y)^z\ =\ (x^z)^y&lt;/math&gt;.

An eavesdropper can get A and B, but cannot easily calculate the key.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Transition State==

Many reactions occur in a single step when two reactant molecules collide with sufficient energy in the proper spatial orientation to create a product.  Many other reactions, however, do not occur in a single step, and such reactions are said to have transition states.  Multistep reactions have products that result from a series or chain of reactions, and these reactions are the kind that actually do pass through a transition state.

==Intermediate Molecules==
Multi-step reactions have an intermediate molecule that forms as a sort-of halfway point between the reactant and the product.  This intermediate molecule cannot be isolated in solution, because it is typically of much higher energy than either the reactants or the products.  

At a basic level of organic chemistry the intermediate molecule is often merely predicted or assumed, but many are also known to exist due to experimental observations in the laboratory.  Inversions and other changes in molecular configuration without another, more plausible explanation are one type of proof that certain reactions pass through a transition state.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''EXAMPLE''': As an example of a molecular inversion, in a 1st order nucleophilic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 reaction) the chirality of a carbon can be &quot;flipped&quot; from S to R configuration (or vice versa) 50% of the time.  This is due to the chiral carbon having only sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization of its electrons in the intermediate state, which creates a carbon center that is flat and thus subject to nucleophilic attack from either the top or the bottom.  If inversion occurs then it is considered to be proof that the reaction indeed is S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 and therefore has an intermediate molecule in its transition state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  NOTE: THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SEVERAL ERRORS AND NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.

==Energy Diagrams and Transition States==
Observing energy diagrams of reactions, you may notice that instead of a single peak energy, the energy peaks, drops a little, peaks once again and then returns to a lower energy state than the original molecule.  The &quot;saddle&quot; between the two peaks represents an intermediate - a place where the reaction temporarily &quot;rests&quot; between energy peaks. The energy peaks are defined as 'transition states' with no finite existence.  Reaction intermediates will often have a finite existence.  NOTE: THE DIAGRAM INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIES AN INTERMEDIATE AS A TRANSITION STATE.  IN FACT, THE ENERGY PEAKS ARE TRANSITION STATES BETWEEN THE INTERMEDIATE AND EITHER THE STARTING MATERIAL OR THE PRODUCT.

== Introduction to onigiri ==

Onigiri (also called omusubi) is a ball or triangle of hot or cold [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], often with a filling, frequently wrapped in [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]] making it easier to eat. It is a popular snack food, and is also common as part of a packed lunch. Depending on your location, some convenience store chains have shelves with a large selection of fresh onigiri for sale.

The most common form of onigiri has a filling in the center. This is often something sour or salty, as it helps preserve the rice for longer periods of time. Common fillings include [[Cookbook:Umeboshi|umeboshi]] (Japanese pickled plum); [[Cookbook:Katsuobushi|katsuobushi]] (dried bonito flakes, often called &quot;okaka&quot; in this case) moistened in [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]; cooked, salted [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] (&quot;sake&quot;); cod roe (&quot;tarako&quot;); [[Cookbook:Kombu|kombu]]; and canned [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]] (&quot;sea-chicken&quot;) with [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]. Less common is onigiri with the filling mixed in with the rice, making it spread throughout the rice. 

A related dish is Yaki-onigiri, which is a plain onigiri without fillings that has been brushed with soy sauce or [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]] and grilled. This is a common side dish in pubs. A creative variation is a yaki-onigiri in a bowl of [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] garnished with chopped [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] and katsuobushi.

Fillings for onigiri are only limited to your imagination.  One point to remember is to choose fillings that are not overly hard/crunchy.  If they are reasonably hard they become quite difficult to eat.  Western fillings that can be quite delicious include such things as corned meats, avocado, even olives or semidried tomatoes.  A recommendation is to use fillings with a lot of flavour as it can be very bland and to cut them to small pieces.

== Making onigiri ==
* '''Difficulty:''' Incredibly easy.  If you can boil rice and handle a little heat in the fingers, you can make onigiri.
* '''Time:''' About 45 minutes.  Most of this time is taken in prep work (i.e., cooking and cooling of rice)

=== Ingredients ===
* Japanese-style Short Grained Rice
* Filling (Ex:)
** Plums
** Tuna
** Salmon
** Egg
** [[Cookbook:Bonito Flakes|Katsuobushi]] (Bonito Flakes)
* Nori

===  Procedure ===
* First, you need to use Japanese-style short grain rice; if the rice isn't sticky, there is obviously little chance of the onigiri staying together. Cook it in the usual way (using the instructions that are on the packet or included with the rice cooker). A rice cooker is recommended since it will be far more 'hands off' and will also free up more time to prepare the fillings.  Estimate that one deciliter (1/2 cup) of uncooked rice will become about two larger onigiri or three smaller ones.  While the rice is cooking, prepare the fillings. As you can see in the list above, there is wide latitude on what you can use as a filling. A few easy examples:
**Umeboshi: estimate one-two [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] per onigiri. Squeeze out the stone, and you're done!
** Bonito Flakes: take a deciliter or so of the flakes, and pour a ''little'' soy sauce over it - it is very easy to pour too much, so be careful. Mix the flakes and the soy sauce until the flakes are moistened.
** Tuna: Take a can of tuna. Mix with a little mayonnaise - again, be sure you don't make it too wet. Add seasoning to taste; this can be chopped leeks, soy sauce, or [[Cookbook:Pepper|chilies]]; sour or salty flavours work well.
* When the rice is done and has allowed to sit for a while, but not too long, it needs to be hot - it is time to make the rice balls. It is a good idea to have a moderately large, clear workspace that is easy to clean afterwards. The rice is sticky, and you will end up getting it everywhere in the area. You need a bowl with salt water to rinse your fingers - the rice is ''sticky''; also, the salty water enhances the flavour of the onigiri. Lastly, you will probably want to have some sheets of nori, though if you can't find it or don't like it, you can certainly do without.  There are two options listed that can be used to make these items:
** Option 1 is to wet your hands in the salt water. Take two large spoonfuls of rice into one hand (carefully; the rice is hot), and gently squeeze and flatten it with the other. Make an indentation in the middle, and put some of the filling into the center. Be a little careful to get the filling only in the center and not all over the ball; that can make the rice less sticky, and stickiness is good. 
** &quot;Fold&quot; the rice over the filling so it becomes covered. Squeeze gently, and mold it into a triangular shape by folding both your hands along the palms while keeping the fingers straight. Squeeze like that, rotating the ball a few times, and you will soon have a very neat triangle - this really is much harder to explain than to do. Once the ball is done, put it down on a clean surface to cool down. Rinse your hands and repeat.
** Option 2 is to use a bowl and some plastic film (saran wrap/cling wrap).  Place about 2/3rds of the mixture into the centre of the cling wrap that has been draped into the bowl loosely.  Then add approximately 2 teaspoons of filling (this is working off of about 3-4 portions per cup of rice.  Then place the last 1/3 of the rice to the top.  Then, mould the onigiri within the cling wrap.  This drastically reduces mess and also is slightly more 'kid friendly'.
* Once the balls are reasonably cool, you need to protect them from drying out. The easiest way is to wrap them in cling wrap, or put them into an airtight plastic food container. When it is time to eat, take one rice ball, wrap it in a piece of nori, and eat away. If you don't mind soggy nori, you can wrap the balls in nori beforehand.

=== Tips, Notes, and Variations ===
Do not ever use refrigerated, cold rice and do not refrigerate after assembling onigiri.  Store in lunch cooler or thermos, the rice gets hard and doesn’t taste well.

You can however, freeze onigiri and then microwave them to defrost and then pack for a tasty lunch!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whether or not to abide by the laws and decrees of one's own country is the question addressed by Plato's &quot;Apology.&quot;  Socrates was accused and found guilty of &quot;corrupting the youth.&quot;  For this he was sentenced to death. With hindsight, and based on what we have remaining written by Socrates' friends and supporters, it appears that Socrates was unjustly accused, tried, and condemned.

Socrates points out that he voluntarily remained in his country.  He participated in government appropriately.  For these reasons (and others) he felt he was rationally obliged to abide by the laws and decrees.

Was Socrates right? How does this message apply to us today?      

For people living in a free and open society, Socrates' argument may well be every bit as applicable today as it was 2500 years ago in Athens.

One should note that Socrates might well have saved his own life had he tempered his thoughts with a more remorseful tone. Socrates refused to compromise his principles -- i.e., that he should say precisely what he thought -- and thus he forfeited his life. In this, Socrates poses an enduring example of authenticity and integrity.

We should also note that Socrates never failed to challenge the worldview of his listeners. The Apologia, in which he suggests that, rather than killing him, the State should sustain him as a pensioner, is an example of his bold but internally-consistent style of argument. For this alone, even if his logical and philosophical contributions are ignored, Socrates' greatness should be recognized and respected.

Can anybody tell me about where to get a pictorial guide to learn salsa. If its on net and for free it would be great...Thanx Vipul

If anybody wants to edit this page, take careful note of the templates used, they're fairly fragile.  There are some planned changes to mediawiki that will make the markup used here simpler.  When I hear that they're implemented, I'll change this book so that it is easier for people to edit. [[User:Ricky clarkson|Ricky Clarkson]] 09:37, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

maybe a place for alternative names - multiple names for one move and multiple moves for one name is common. for example i've encountered at least 3 variants of Dedo, there is confusion as to which move is setenta y seis and which is setenta complicado, and even more confusion about prima, prima con la hermana vs adios, adios con la prima vs adios (2 turns no partner shift) vs avión (same)

also, i propose this book is expanded to not just quick incoherent notes about moves but an attempt to a more systematical description. introduction could contain list of terms such as outside/inside turn, cross-handed, right to right, guapea, etc. [[User:Saur43|Saur43]] 23:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Video Links to the Wiki ==


I am trying to figure out where to find the info for the codecs used in the .avi links provided in wikibook index.  If someone can direct me there, it would be most helpful.

== Application for visualisation ==
Just a heads up if you want to add some pictures of the steps to this book. There is a nice free Java application, that can be used for illustrating dancing steps that already has the basic moves for all dances built in. Have a look here:
http://www.sebastianbauer.info/index.php?page=simpledance
If you create new moves, don't forget to write a mail to the author, so he can make them available to everyone. --[[Special:Contributions/84.178.123.44|84.178.123.44]] ([[User talk:84.178.123.44|talk]]) 16:14, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

         claims:

         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
             Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display,
             perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions
             thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger
             Work; and

         (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
             Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer
             for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or
             portions thereof).

         (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective
             on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code
             under the terms of this License.

         (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
             granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code;
             2) separate from the Original Code or 3) for infringements caused
             by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination

             a Larger Work; and

         (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
             Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
             combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
             combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,
             and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
             Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of

             Code.

         (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
             granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the

             3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
             Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made

             Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
             infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
             that Contributor.

===3. Distribution Obligations.===

    3.1. Application of License.

         The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
         governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
         Section 2.2.

         The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under
         the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
         under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with
         every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
         impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
         the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
         hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering
         the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

    3.2. Availability of Source Code.

         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
         either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
         Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
         months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
         (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
         has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
         ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

    3.3. Description of Modifications.

         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
         file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
         the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
         Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
         origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

         (a) Third Party Claims.

             If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
             intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
             granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
             must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
             &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim
             in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
             If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is
             made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
             promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
             available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
             appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
             inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
             been obtained.

         (b) Contributor APIs.

             If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
             interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
             are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
             also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (c) Representations.

             Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
             Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
             Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
             Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
             this License.

    3.5. Required Notices.

         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
         Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
         Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in
         a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
         Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
         obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
         may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
         offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
         requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
         and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
         the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
         including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
         obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
         in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
         collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
         Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
         Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
         contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
         compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
         Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
         License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
         from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
         Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
         the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
         terms You offer.

    3.7. Larger Works.

         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
         Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
         requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

===4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.===

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
    with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
    the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
    Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
    description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill
    to be able to understand it.

===5. Application of this License.===

    5.1. Attached license.

         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
         attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    5.2. Detached license.

         This License applies to code which is part of a Source Tree
         containing this license in a file named LICENSE or license.html
         at the top of its hierarchy and which is not explicitly covered by a
         different license.

===6. Versions of the License.===

    6.1. New Versions.

         The AROS development team may publish revised and/or new versions of
         the License from time to time.  Each version will be given a
         distinguishing version number.

    6.2. Effect of New Versions.

         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
         the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
         of any subsequent version of the License. No one other than the AROS
         development team has the right to modify the terms applicable to
         Covered Code created under this License.

===7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.===

    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
    MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
    SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
    CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE
    IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

===8. TERMINATION.===

    8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
         survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
         shall survive.

    8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
         (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
         Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
         file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:

         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
             infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
             Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
             shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
             prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
             You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
             agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
             Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
             litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
             such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
             royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
             writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
             the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
             2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
             period specified above.

         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
             Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
             then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
             2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first
             made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
             that Participant.

    8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
         that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
         infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
         or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
         litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
         Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
         determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

    8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
         user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
         have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

===9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.===

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
    ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
    OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
    SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
    PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
    THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

===10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.===

'''Pasta marinata''' (Italian for &quot;marinaded dough&quot;) is a batter used when frying food.

==Ingredients==
*2 ounces semolina [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (separated)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*2 ounces melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]),
*about 8 ounces [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
#Mix the following ingredients well together: semolina flour, the yolks of two eggs, a little salt, and melted butter.  
#Add the water so as to form a liquid substance.  
#At the last add the whites of two eggs beaten up to a snow.  

This will make a good paste for masking meat, fish, vegetables, or sweets which are to be fried in the Italian manner, but if for meat or vegetables add a few drops of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or a little [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]].

Would it be true that lines of a (dimension) forces  don’t occupy the same space (except where the are distorted by the influence of another  (crossed))?? laubesb@nex.net.au steven
: I am not really sure that this is the best place to put such a question. This is the talk page for of the contents article, and is supposedly for discussing the contents of the Physics section, specifically whether something should or shouldnt be in the Physics section, whether it has an appropriate name, whether it ought to be placed in a different position, etc.--[[User:81.157.101.101|81.157.101.101]] 19:34, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== NPOV ==
:A lot of the subjects covered in Quantum Field Theory (Postgraduate) are considered Undergraduate subjects in the UK. Is there a way to remove this US bias? --[[User:81.157.101.101|81.157.101.101]] 19:30, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:But quantum field theory is not an undergraduate topic in the UK. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:39, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Radiation Physics ==
This is s large subject with many practical applications for example in medicine and nuclear power generation.  Should it not be included as a sub-topic?

== Consolidation ==

This links to a huge number of works. When I first found this page, I didn't think it was a list of textbooks on Wikibooks but more of a... hodgepodge thrown together hapharzardly. All of these works need to be consolidated, somehow... Perhaps there could be several levels of physics textbooks - Middle School, High School, College, Graduate? And then this page could link to other Wikibooks on Electromagnetism, Optics, Electronics and other topics that are more on the fringe - when I think of physics, I think objects in motion, touching on waves, touching on gravity, but mostly forces, work, some energy, collisions, velocity, acceleration, etc.

'''I would be willing to head a WikiProject on the Physics textbooks'''. It's very important to me to have a focused, comprehensive, and overall well put-together text here. I'll do what I can, if anyone else is with me. [[User:LockeShocke|LockeShocke]] 03:57, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)


== Physics experiments: household items / low budget schools ==

Noticing that schools (and populations which are curious but can't afford the tools) are increasingly having lower budgets to conduct physics experiements, i propose that we make some kind of project that takes common household items and uses them to create experiments. 

if your interested in collaborating with me to create such experiments, than contact me on my discussion page at [[User: compatta | compatta]] 

(ex) measuring resistance qualitatively
using a wheatstone bridge, qualitatively conclude the resistance of the object that is inserted. (multimeters are pretty expensive)

== Free physics textbook ==
Can someone check this out?

http://www.motionmountain.net/

Apparently, someone has put a FREE, 1200 page physics textbook on the web. It's copyrighted, so we can't just move the whole thing onto Wikibooks, but maybe someone wants to [http://www.motionmountain.net/author.html contact the author] and inform him that Wikibooks exists, he might grant special permission or something...

If somebody helps me, I am ready to put a test chapter on wikibooks.

== Needs improvement ==

This page blows, I think that a lot of the information is there, and just badly organized, so I am going to start a comprehensive &quot;cleaned up&quot; version ''under'' everything else.  I am not really sure if this is the best way of doing this, but I don't want to wipe the page first, nor do I think starting a new one on top of the several other pages is a good idea.  Anyone wants to help me, send me a message, and I will be very happy that day. [[User:Sameerkale|Sameer Kale]] 23:15, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

== Orphaned Modules ==

While traversing the [[Special:LonelyPages|orphaned pages]] list, I came across this module which should probably be placed on the shelf, but I'm not sure where it would go.

It is common to add a small amount of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (approx. 1/2 teaspoon per egg) to the egg mixture before cooking (will make eggs fluffier).  [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] is also popular, and should be added near the end of cooking.  Other ingredients to try include: [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|peppers]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], shaved [[Cookbook:Truffle|truffles]], smoked [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]], [[cookbook:Chive|chives]], [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] and [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]. [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] is also good mixed into the egg mixture prior to cooking.

==Procedure 1==
# Heat pan (a non-stick or well seasoned cast iron is preferable) to medium and add enough butter, oil, or cooking spray to coat bottom
# Crack desired number of eggs into a bowl.
# Add milk or water to eggs, if desired (apprx. 1/2 teaspoon per egg)
# Season with salt and pepper to taste (other herbs and spices may be used as well)
# Beat eggs gently with fork or whisk for 15-20 seconds.  It is not necessary to make a completely uniform mixture.
# Add egg mixture to heated, greased pan.
# With a spatula or spoon (avoid metal tools if using teflon pan) continuously gently scrape cooked egg from pan.  The length of time and the frequency with which you scrape will determine the consistency of the eggs and is a matter of personal preference. The time will vary from 30 seconds to 3 or more minutes depending on number and type of eggs, size and heat of pan, and personal preference.

==Procedure 1b - Microwave==

To cook in microwave, grease bowl before cracking one to two eggs into bowl.  Mix gently.  Microwave on high for 40 seconds to 2 minutes.  Actual cooking time will vary.  A general rule of thumb is to watch eggs for entire time and stop microwave when entire mixture has risen somewhat.  If it explodes, you waited too long.  Egg(s) will come out in shape of the bowl; depending on the size of the bowl, this method is very useful for making an appropriate size egg patty for a sandwich.

==Procedure 2==
# Heat a non-stick pan w/ the bottom covered in butter, margarine, oil or cooking spray to Med. settings.
# Crack eggs and place inside pan.
# Immediately begin mixing while lightly sprinkling with salt for 5 seconds.
# Continue mixing until eggs are thoroughly scrambled and mixed.
# Turn off heat, and wait 1 minute for eggs to cool.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*[[Cookbook:Southwestern Scramble|Southwestern Scramble]] and the various [[Cookbook:Omelet Recipes|Omelet Recipes]] are variations of scrambled eggs

==History==
XBasic is a variant of the BASIC programming language. Xbasic was developed in the late 1980s for the Motorola 88000 CPU and Unix. In the early 1990s XBasic was ported to Windows and Linux. Since 1999 it is has been available as [[Open Source]] software.

==Making a Standalone Executable==
XBasic programs can be compiled to create an executable just by double-clicking the program's MAK file. The following method works for XBasic V6.2.0 and above, in Windows 95; it should also work with later Windows versions.

The setup needs to be done only once. 
In all of the following, replace ''''\XBasic''' with the path to your XBasic directory.

1. Using a text editor (Notepad will do), put the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT. Do not put any spaces or tabs around the &quot;=&quot;. 

SET XBDIR=\XBasic

SET PATH=%XBDIR%\bin;%PATH%

SET INCLUDE=%XBDIR%\include;%INCLUDE%

SET LIB=%XBDIR%\lib;%LIB%


If the path to your XBasic directory contains spaces (eg., \Program Files\xb), then it may be necessary to use quotes around the paths, as for example 

SET PATH=&quot;%XBDIR%\bin&quot;;%PATH%


These lines should be placed after any existing definitions of the PATH, INCLUDE, or LIB variables.  Save the edited AUTOEXEC.BAT, and re-boot.

2. Make sure the following files are in the appropriate XBasic directories:

\XBasic\bin
     spasm.exe     nmake.exe     link.exe

\XBasic\include
     xbasic.mak

\XBasic\lib
     xstart.o, and all RESOURCES, STDLIBS, and LIBS listed in xbasic.mak and in your own .mak file:

     advapi32.lib comdlg32.lib gdi32.lib kernel32.lib msvcrt.lib user32.lib winspool.lib xb.lib
     xb.rbj

     (There will be more if your program IMPORTs anything other than these libraries or the standard XBasic libraries.)

3. Create the text file NMAKE.BAT, containing the following line

&quot;%XBDIR%\bin\nmake.exe&quot; %1

and save it - for example, in the \XBasic\bin directory. The quotes are only necessary if your XBasic directory path contains spaces (eg., \Program Files\xb). The purpose of this BAT is just to keep the DOS window open when nmake.exe has finished, so you can see results of the compilation.

4. From Explorer's View menu, select Options, then File Types to associate MAK files with NMAKE.BAT. Make this the Default association for this file type.

If you aren't familiar with this procedure, then an alternative is to double-click any .mak file. An &quot;Open With&quot; dialog will appear, asking you which program you want to use to open .mak files. Click &quot;Other&quot;, then go to the folder containing nmake.bat, and select it. Also, make sure the checkbox 'Always use this program to open this file' is checked.


This completes the setup.  Now whenever you want to create an EXE, just select 'assembly' from the 'run' menu in the PDE - which creates the .s and .mak files - then double-click the .mak file.  Or, run XBasic from the command line, using the command xb myprogram.x.  Create a DLL the same way, but select 'library' from the 'run' menu instead (or run xb myprogram.x -lib).  (For more information on making a DLL, see Multiple Module Programs.)

One hint: Save the .x source before creating the .s and .mak files, not after. If the source is saved after the assembly (.s) file is created, then nmake will see the .s file as being older than the .x file, and will invoke xb.exe to re-compile the .x.

When running your EXE, remember that you should have copied xbrun.dll into your \Windows folder, and re-named it xb.dll. Also, you can run the EXE from any folder except the XBasic\bin folder; if you run it in this folder, it will link to the wrong xb.dll, and start up the PDE instead of running your program.

==Collaborative Project==

''please add your contributions''

Here is how : [[Help:Editing]]

Is Opensource the best place for collaborative projects?
I am sure there must be simpler tools?

===Idea 1===

Xbasic on a USB stick (and/or self booting CD)

I recently put [[Puppy Linux]] on a 64 meg USB stick

Maybe a dual booting CD (Linux and Windows)

ReactOS that is developing an Open Source

Windows NT)

===Idea 2===
XBasic Wizards

One of the things we hear on the forum again and again

is I have just started etc

How do I etc

Well how about a list of questions

and paremeters set and then the required functions are added

This would mean that nay code we are familair with could be added

===Idea 3===
. . . Your idea here . . .	

Code examples

Look here to see some screenshots of projects completed using XBasic. These
are programmes developed for airlines in Iceland by Stefan Saemundsson:

[http://www.xbasic.org/samplan1.jpg XBasic Program screenshot] 

[http://www.xbasic.org/sam41.jpg XBasic another program screenshot]


''add your links here''

==Future Developments==
A regularly updated [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/xblite/ XBLite] is a Windows only version which aims to use the API of Windows to reduce the code size.

A new update of Xbasic is expected before the end of 2004

A new version XBasic 2 that generates C code rather than assembler is also being created.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When contacting PTC's support people, it is important to bear in mind a number of suggestions in order to help them help you.  

* First, remember that even if it is an emergency for you, they can't know that without you telling them.  They will frequently ask, but if this is a situation where you need an answer on the same day, or the next day, politely let them know, and explain to them why; the more they know about your situation, the more they can tailor the answer to it.  At the same time, keep in mind that if you're calling them at the 11th hour, the time remaining before your deadline might not be enough for them to give you the most meaningful answer.  In most cases, they will try, however.

* To avoid the unhappy situation of calling Support in an emergency, try to envision possible trouble spots in a project beforehand.  Ask them about possible pitfalls of one approach versus another, and chances are they will be able to enumerate the pros and cons.  If nothing else, you can at least use this to obtain a call number that will get you right through if you're running into trouble at a later stage.  

* Use the Web utilities to open calls.  If you don't like waiting on the phone, just don't wait; they really do make it very easy to avoid, and while sometimes there will be a wait for a callback, at least your neck and shoulder aren't stiff from cradling the phone, and you've gotten some work done.  

* When exchanging voicemail with them, always give the call number, even if you just gave it to the operator.  When returning a call in the initial stages of discussing an issue, give them information to start off with.  If the initial call description didn't have much, let them know what they should be looking at; the more you tell them, the more, and the sooner they can help you.

* When you upload data, always zip up the files.  It doesn't matter if they're small, they're just more likely to get through intact if they're zipped up.  Always be sure to follow their directions when sending data, to avoid wasting your time with multiple emails.  

* If you're planning on sending a screenshot, but there's no problem with sending a model, just send the model.  A screenshot is only useful if you think they don't believe you, and really, they've no reason not to.  The model is far more useful to troubleshoot a problem, and, in many cases, not much bigger than the screenshot.  

* In most cases, if they figure out what needs to be done with a model, they won't be able to send it back, for a variety of reasons.  If you don't think you'll be able to do it on your own, have them walk you through it using WebEx, or request a detailed writeup over email (which is useful to refer back to as well).  

* For an issue where Pro/ENGINEER exits, try the same thing multiple times.  If it is not repeatable, make a note of it, but hold off on contacting Technical Support, as there probably won't be much they can do.  If it is repeatable, try it with the config.pro option GRAPHICS set to WIN32_GDI (on Windows), and restart Pro/ENGINEER.  If it ceases to happen at that point, it's a graphics card-related issue, and you might want to upgrade your graphics drivers.  If it still happens, then you can save a lot of time in their investigation of the issue.  If you send PTC a trail file, make it as simple as possible, with all files in the working directory, and no special configs or mapkeys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientific Method is a misleading term because there is no single method of science.

A more accurate term would be Scientific Best Practices. 

Science is a search for truth about the natural world.  

In the past, Science was called Natural Philosophy.   

Philosophy is a discipline that humans use to discover truth.

Natural is a word we use to describe anything not made by humans.

So then, Science is the search for truth about nature.

Different scientists use different methods depending on what they study.

The field of science that studies stars and galaxies is called Astronomy.   
It is not possible for humans to perfrom experiments on stars and galaxies.
Chemistry studies how atoms and molecules react to form different molecules.
Chemists can experiment directly with the atoms and molecules that they study.
Both Astronomy and Chemistry are sciences.  
But each science uses very different methods to discover the truth about nature.

In general all sciences use two kinds of information to study nature.
Observations of natural phenomenon are recorded and are called Data.
Ideas that explain observations are called a Hypotheses.
Scientists share data, the steps used to collect the data, and their ideas that explain the data.   When many people have reproduced a set of observations and think that a particular hypotheses is true, the hypothese may become a Theory.

The open sharing of information has been part of science for hundreds of years.
In recent years, some sharing of information has become controlled by greed.
Corporations attempt to own scietific discoveries that their employees make.

Politeness in Japanese language is important when speaking to anyone; being punched in the face or getting fired by your employer are prime examples of what can happen when being impolite by simply speaking!

The Japanese society can be thought of like a ladder: at the top rungs are those of the highest social standing (royalty, company CEOs, high-ranking government officials, high-ranking religious figures, and so on), and then below them are the common people, and then the scum of the earth even farther below. These distinctions are quite evident in how people act around others and how they act towards them. While all cultures reflect this on some level, Japanese culture revolves around it.

From the bottom of the social ladder upwards, the Japanese language changes in sometimes subtle, sometimes noticeable ways. Let's start in the middle, with Standard Polite language. This is comprised of ていねい (teinei, or polite) verbs, grammar, and nouns. (As a side note, all foreigners should begin learning Japanese with Standard Polite forms, then move around from there.) One would use verbs ending in -ma + the ending, standard honorifics when required, and state the subject every few times once understood until the subject changes. Even further upwards, at the top, highly irregular verbs replace the more common ones, one would speak in a way to make the listener or object more honored and the speaker lower and humbler.

Going down the social ladder, the language becomes simpler, rougher, and even rude to some. The subject, once understood, can be dropped altogether at first. It would become highly repetitive to constantly say the subject over and over once understood by the listener. While this facet of informality is seen in all levels of Japanese language formality, it becomes more and more prominent in informal speech. One can replace the polite copula &quot;desu&quot; with the simple copula &quot;da,&quot; or drop it altogether. Simple forms of verbs and adjectives are used more often. Vulgar or taboo words appear more frequently. Honorifics are rarely seen, if at all. Talking in this way to higher ranking people than yourself is comparable to obliviating your social life and your chances to advance in rank.

An example chart of comparitive polite forms is below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In American and other Western societies, hierarchy is based on supposed skill level and theoretically, everyone has equal opportunity. In Japanese society, by contrast, people are &quot;ranked&quot; based on their age, job or grade level, and other criteria. Japanese language reflects this: there are a variety of ways to express formality (politeness) and informality (impoliteness) in Japanese language. This is called the honorifics system.

== Verbs (動詞 - Doushi) ==
Japanese has three different ways to espress formality in verbs: the plain form (くだけた, kudaketa, &quot;chatty&quot; or &quot;impolite&quot;), the simple polite form (ていねい, teinei, &quot;polite&quot;) and the advanced polite form (敬語, keigo, &quot;honorific language&quot;). Kudaketa verbs build off the dictionary form of a verb. Teinei verbs build off the stem of a verb + ma + the tense endings. Keigo is usually formed by archaic or highly irregular verbs that can be divided into two further groups: 尊敬語, sonkeigo, or honorific, and 謙譲語, kenjougo, or humble language. Sonkeigo&quot; is a honorific way of speaking in which you elevate the rank of the person you're speaking to or about way above your own. Kenjougo is a humble way of speaking in which you humble yourself or lower your rank below the person you're speaking to.

Below is a chart comparing kudaketa verbs to teinei verbs.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; These forms are not used commonly. Usually, the plain forms of the conjunctive and conditional tenses would be used.

On the conjunctive, also known as the &quot;-te form:&quot; This is used as a variety of tenses but mainly when several verbs come in succession of each other (私はピザを食べて、眠りました。 - Watashi wa piza wo tabete, nemurimashita. - I ate pizza, then slept.)

The おいでになります ''oideninarimasu'' comes from the regular forms above applied to the old verb いづ ''izu'' (= modern 出る ''deru'').

== Honorifics (敬語 - Keigo) ==

A variety of ways can be employed to make words polite or impolite. One way that can be used is simply choosing a certain word (i.e., instead of using あなた (anata) to refer to the second person, one can use their name) or employ the usage of special affixes. Notably one of the most common is -さん (-san), used to denote something like Mr./Mrs./Ms. onto a name. A list of affixes is below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
! Affix !! Romaji !! Translation
|-
|お-
|o-
|Honorific title used on words of typically Japanese origin or other titles
|-
|ご-
|go-
|Honorific title used on words of typically foreign origin
|-
| -さん
| -san
|Mr./Mrs./Ms./Miss
|-
| -ちゃん
| -chan
|Used to denote familiarity or a kind of cuteness
|-
| -君 (-くん)
| -kun
|Used to denote someone of lower rank or a small level of impoliteness
|-
| -後輩 (-こうはい)
| -kohai
|Used to denote someone of a lower grade than the speaker ('underclassman')*
|-
| -先輩 (-せんぱい)
| -senpai
|Used to denote someone of a higher grade than the speaker ('upperclassman')
|-
| -様 (-さま)
| -sama
|Used to denote someone of royalty or godhood
|-
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; -こうはい (kohai) is rarely used as an affix. Most people in a senpai position would use -くん (kun) instead.

Note that -くん (kun) is a somehow (not strictly, just more often) preferred affix speaking to or between boys (although boyfriends are sometimes addressed with -ちゃん). Girls tend to use -ちゃん (chan) in a similar manner, although -くん (kun) is also used sometimes. Unlike -さん (san) which is commonly used with a family name, these two affixes can also be used with given names (moreover, the name used may be shortened in front of these two affixes).

Wow, looks really really good so far. Like the fact that you didn't forget the classless (prototype-based) oop, which normally happens. I personally don't feel that C++ or Java are at the same level at smalltalk, many things are not objects in both Java and C (e.g.: Classes are not objects and methodes neither). But so far a very good job. [[User:Gmlk|Gmlk]] 15:30, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Re: tone and inheritence.  
I think an editor that selected more academic vocabulary would be better suited for a work that desires 'textbook quality'.  Granted, I didn't read the whole article, I just skimmed it as I evaluated its suitibility as an introduction to object-oritented programming for non-programmers.  I stopped reading and dismissed the content as worthless when I came across the &quot;is-a vs has-a moley baloney&quot; topic under &quot;Inheritence&quot;;  if one does not recognize the importance of these two fundamental relations then it is impossible to build quality software using object-oriented techniques or otherwise.

For example, while colloquially understandable, I feel the term 'moley baloney' is completely inappropriate.  I feel The entire &quot;Inheritence&quot; section is poorly structured and contains little information of value.  I completely agree that inheritence is an often misunderstood concept for many programmers new to object-oritented techniques.  The muddling of &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;implementation&quot; in popular class-based object-oriented language inevitably leads to misunderstandings.  This section would do well to cite sources that examine inheritence from an object- or functional-based perspective as it is impossible to understand inheritence before the conflicts between the notions of 'type', 'class', and 'interface' are resolved.  Which brings me back to where I started as it is my belief that such understanding can only achieved if one understands the is-a and has-a relations.

:Obviously, you didn't look very closely.  This text is specifically not aimed at non-programmers.  It is not an academic treatise.  However, many, many texts trot out the old is-a vs has-a discussion when itroducing inheritance.  This confuses type, class, interface, and implementation.  Because this confusion is so common, I feel it is necessary explain it's failings.  Going into a long winded discussion of type theory and systems before before tackling this confusion is premature, in my opinion. --[[User:Augustus.saunders|Augustus.saunders]] 00:55, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== What is OOP? What is OOP? What is OOP?  ==

'''This text is a horror.''' It is a horrible read. Demotivating. There is so much incoherent babbling about nonrelevant stuff... or about somehow juicy stuff we are not supposed to know yet, but get a taste of nevertheless, but should remember not get into too deep yet, but is nice to get a feeling of already, but we'll explain it later really, and now we will not, but it is nice to... AAAARGh! I'll never understand what Object Oriented Programming is! Please, authors, '''get to the point! What the hell is OOP?'''

Why the long introduction about &quot;classical OOP&quot; and a &quot;modern OOP&quot; without telling us first what is OOP. And add in REAL Python code, instead of having us read a warning paragraphs about pseudocodes. The thing I have learned after reading six A4 pages is: encapsulation is important, encapsulation, encapsulation, encapsulation, encapsulation, encapsulation... I ask myself: what the hell is encapsulation? oh, dear reader, haven't we explained that? No! you haven't!

Are you writing a book on the different ways of writing a book?
:''In most books, this chapter would be the heart of the book. But this isn't &quot;How to Program Language-of-the-week Without Even Trying,&quot; and we're not syntax obsessed, assuming you can look in the manual or one of those other books. We want to blaze through here focusing on the concepts and the why's and what-fors so we can get on to the programming! Like we said before, this isn't an academic treatise.
:''&quot;There are some books on OOP that will tell you that the cornerstones of object oriented programming are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, or something along those lines. This is fairly typical of the classic OOP view, and there's nothing wrong with it per se, it's just that we've generalised some ideas and decoupled things here and there since then. But they are still important concepts, so let's dive in!

Who cares that there are different ways of writing books! We come here to know: What is OOP? I don't know. And this way I will never know. Why don't you get to the point? Why do you need to talk about other books? We don't want to know! We want to know about OOP, not about different ways of writing books. Aaargh! (from unknown)

:I would have thought Wikipedia could tell you what OOP was. This book seems to be focused on what the features of OOP are, how they are used, and what is good or bad about each of those features. I don't really see your problem with this text, at least the author is giving an attempt to be entertaining and &quot;personal&quot; to alleviate text boredom.

----
I think that you are looking for a different book.  &quot;OOP&quot; and &quot;Object Oriented Programming&quot; means many things to many people.  Providing a dictionary definition early in the discussion would confuse things more than help.  One of the aims of this text is to counteract much misinformation that has spread over time.  There is a lot of wrong-headed advice given in other texts available, especially those focusing on one particular language, that I feel that it is necessary to address this misinformation.  This derives from a long legacy of ideas superseding each other.  Any text on C++ today that ignores template and generic programming and the STL would be completely remiss.  Similarly, any text hoping to describe modern OOP programming must address the influence of functional programming.  Ruby, Python, and the Boost libraries pretty much define modern OOP practice (by which I mean being used in the real world, not some fancy-pants academia thing).  Nobody would accuse Java or .Net of being on the forefront of programming technique.  But people think of them as being &quot;object oriented.&quot;  Basically, the programming techniques vary significantly depending upon which abstractions a language supports.  Thankfully, they can be loosely divided into 2 categories, which I choose to call &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;modern.&quot;  I think the terms are appropriate.  Trying to define OOP independant of these is, IMO, a mistake.  OOP is used as such a catch-all term it's necessary to lay out a map.

Finally, many random people contribute little bits and pieces, and obviously everything is a work in progress.  You may be used to 3 page articles on &quot;exxxxpert-programmer.com&quot; or some such, but books tend to have introductions that establish the basics and set the stage.  Books tend to go more in-depth and go a little slower.  A book of this type should be in the 300-500 page range to have any hope of adequately covering the material.  Currently, there is a fair word count on design patterns that would more properly belong in an appendix.  Aside from that, the total page count here is less than 20.  So of course it never delivers. --[[User:Augustus.saunders|Augustus.saunders]] 00:42, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

I agree with unknown user, the language used is kinda chatty and really doesn't get the point across to some of us...(Uh...tide, tide...something. Why don't they have a button for it here?)

== Simple Objects vs Behavioral Entities ==
Quote from the section:

    &quot;Writing good simple objects, combined with good collection libraries provided by your language of choice, can easily reduce the complexity of basic operations by as much as 80%.&quot;

How was &quot;complexity&quot; measured? By who and when? Pretty bold and interesting statement. Definitely requires a reference. I would be very interested in knowing what the source of this claim is for one.

== is a Vs has a ==
The main reason for this concept--a very good one--is that inheritance can be a bad idea, it binds classes too tightly and makes both reuse and debugging more difficult.

I'm not saying there aren't many perfect cases for inheritance, but misusing it is much worse than not using it at all.

When teaching someone new to the subject when to inherit and when to encapsulate, &quot;Has a&quot; or &quot;Is a&quot; makes a good test.  You will find very few instances of &quot;is a&quot;, and that's exactly how often you should subclass.

The single case for inheritance is where multiple children inherit from a single parent, override methods of that parent, and have those methods called through an object of the type of the parent (IE: you are using polymorphism).

The first Java GUI framework (AWT) was extend-based.  It was a horrid model that didn't scale.  Notice that in Swing you are never required to extend?

For a another viewpoint, you might google &quot;Extends is evil&quot;[http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2003/jw-0801-toolbox.html], there is a java world article that does a great job of examining why you should limit instances where you subclass.

Note that implementing an interface is a COMPLETELY different discussion--It has nothing to do with subclassing and should not be avoided--in fact, should be used as often as possible.

(I'd like to move the meat of this rant into the main module, but I'll wait for comments first since it may be more controversial than I would have suspected)

Object oriented programming is said to be one of the most influential developments in modern computer programming, gaining acceptance and praise for it’s’ ability to facilitate complexities in a field of growing software systems. Object oriented programming as a concept is a programming language which uses some object oriented construct or programming which in term is supported by some object oriented principle.  Object oriented programming is noted to be a mindset which respects programming as a problem solving method which requires precise application of abstractions which ultimately divides complex problems into manageable pieces or tasks. Idealistically object oriented code can be broken down into a vast number of smaller tasks with each task being simplistically verifiable. Ultimately the goal of object oriented programming is to facilitate the combination of several different programming functions and techniques for the purpose of easier maintenance and more widespread reuse, with the future hope of standardization of functional techniques within the object oriented programming

== Functional Programming ==
Why on earth would there be a functional programming section in an OO book?  Not debating the usability of Functions, just the placement.  If I don't see comments in a few days, I'll delete that and fix the &quot;is a vs has a&quot; stuff.

I wanted to write my own book, but in completely different manner. I want to start from Functional Programming first. Can I begin my own book? I am new in wikibook... [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 15:55, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

:If you don't intent into duplicate content creating a new book with a new approach and directed to a different audience is possible, but it will split the number of possible contributors Try to see if no one objects first to the changes (I've checked the history log for contributors and it seems the only registered users contributing content are [[User:Augustus.saunders]] and [[User:BillKress]] try posting a note on their talk page or directly contact them by email if available), give it a week if no one objects you can reshape the book, try to find another place/context to any content you will be removing if possible.

We will first define a field.

'''Definition.''' A ''field'' is a non empty set &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with two binary operations &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(F,+,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; has commutative unitary ring structure and satisfy the following property:

&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in F-\{0\} \exists y\in F : x\cdot y=1&lt;/math&gt; 

This means that every element in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; except for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; has a multiplicative inverse.

Essentially, a field is a commutative division ring.

'''Examples:'''

1.&lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Q}, \Bbb{R}, \Bbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; (rational, real and complex numbers) with standard &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; operations have field structure. These are examples with infinite cardinality.

2.&lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;, the integers modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime, and &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; are mod &lt;math&gt;p,&lt;/math&gt; is a family of finite fields.

==Fields and Homomorphisms==

=== Definition (embedding) ===
An '''embedding''' is a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f: F\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; from a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to a field &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Since the kernel of a homomorphism is an ideal, a field's only ideals are &lt;math&gt;{0}&lt;/math&gt; and the field itself, and &lt;math&gt;f(1_F)=1_G&lt;/math&gt;, we must have the kernel equal to &lt;math&gt;{0}&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is injective and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to its image under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the embedding deserves its name.

== Field Extensions ==

===Definition (Field Extension and Degree of Extension)===
*Let F and G be fields. If &lt;math&gt;F\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; and there is an embedding from F into G, then G is a '''field extension''' of F.
*Let G be an extension of F. Consider G as a vector space over the field F. The dimension of this vector space is the '''degree''' of the extension, &lt;math&gt;[G:F]&lt;/math&gt;. If the degree is finite, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a '''finite extension''' of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is of degree &lt;math&gt;n=[G:F]&lt;/math&gt; over F.

===Examples (of field extensions)===
*The real numbers &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be extended into the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{C}.&lt;/math&gt;
*Similarly, one can add the imaginary number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to the field of rational numbers to form the field of Gaussian rationals.

=== Theorem (Existence of Unique embedding from the integers into a field) ===

Let F be a field, then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\alpha: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow F.&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: Define &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha (1)=1_F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha (2)=1_f+1_F&lt;/math&gt; etc. This provides the relevant homomorphism.

Note: The Kernel of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, it is generated by some integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;m=ab&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a,b \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;0=\alpha (m)=\alpha (a)\alpha (b)&lt;/math&gt; and, since &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field and so also an integral domain, &lt;math&gt;\alpha(a)=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\alpha(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;. This cannot be the case since the kernel is generated by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; must be prime or equal 0.

=== Definition (Characteristic of Field) ===

The '''characteristic''' of a field can be defined to be the generator of the kernel of the homomorphism, as described in the note above.

== Algebraic Extensions ==

=== Definition (Algebraic Elements and Algebraic Extension) ===

*Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be an extension of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in K&lt;/math&gt; is '''algebraic''' over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a non-zero polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)\in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\lambda)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is an '''algebraic extension''' of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, such that every element of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Definition (Minimal Polynomial) ===

If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; then the set of polynomials in &lt;math&gt;F[x]&lt;/math&gt; which have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a root is an ideal of &lt;math&gt;F[x]&lt;/math&gt;. This is a principle ideal domain and so the ideal is generated by a unique monic non-zero polynomial, &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We define the &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be the minimal polynomial.

== Splitting Fields ==

=== Definition (Splitting Field) ===

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field, &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2,...,a_n&lt;/math&gt; are roots of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Then a smallest Field Extension of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;a_1,...,a_n&lt;/math&gt; is called a splitting field of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.


===Theorem (Existence of Splitting Fields)===

== Finite Fields ==

=== Theorem (Order of any finite field)===

Let F be a finite field, then &lt;math&gt;\left\vert F \right\vert = p^n &lt;/math&gt; for some prime p and &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

proof: The field of integers mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a subfield of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we can view &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; as a vector space over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;. Further this must be a finite dimensional vector space because &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is finite. Hence any &lt;math&gt;x \in F&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; members of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with scalers in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt; and any such linear combination is a member of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;\left\vert F \right\vert = p^n &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Theorem (every member of F is a root of &lt;math&gt;x^p-x&lt;/math&gt;) ===

let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a field such that &lt;math&gt;\left\vert F \right\vert = p^n &lt;/math&gt;, then every member is a root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^p-x&lt;/math&gt;.

proof: Consider &lt;math&gt;F^*=F/{0}&lt;/math&gt; as a the multiplicative group. Then by la grange's theorem &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in F^*, x^{p^n-1}=1&lt;/math&gt;. So multiplying by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;x^{p^n}=x&lt;/math&gt;, which is true for all &lt;math&gt;x \in F&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Theorem (roots of &lt;math&gt;x^p-x&lt;/math&gt; are distinct)===

Let &lt;math&gt;x^p-x&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial in a splitting field &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} _p&lt;/math&gt; then the roots &lt;math&gt;a_1,...a_n&lt;/math&gt; are distinct.

__TOC__
In this type of programming, a section of code is written to respond to each event. Events can be user events such as button clicks or mouse moves. Events can also be generated within the computer, for example timer events. Finally, the programmer can generate events.

Responding to an event is sometimes termed handling an event.

The program simply consists of sections that respond to events. These may, in turn use other sections (procedures, methods).

== Example ==


This simple GTK+ program makes a GUI, with a button,
that responds to the click event, after we enter a main-loop
given by the gtk_main() function. When ever events occur,
like &quot;clicked&quot; event, we lookup event-handlers connected
to it via g_signal_connect() function, and delegate functions
by invoking them. In this case the handler, btn_clicked is
invoked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In procedural programming, the program is written as a collection of actions (a procedure) that are carried out in sequence, one after the other. The order is important.

A procedure is sometimes termed an algorithm.

An ingredient of procedural programming is the idea of state. The actions in a program change the value of data items, usually termed variables. As the program executes, the values of variables change. At any point in time the variables have a set of values, which is their state.

==Overview==

'''Structured programming''' is the suggested antidote to unstructured programming, which existed for decades before Structured programming was invented.

== In the beginning, there was UN-structured programming ==

An unstructured program is a procedural program – the statements are executed in sequence as written. But this type of programming uses the goto statement. A goto statement allows control to be passed to any other place in the program.  When a goto statement is executed, the sequence continues from the target of the goto. Thus to understand how a program works, you have to pretend to execute it. This means that it is often difficult to understand the logic of such a program.  Some program compilers cross-index where a goto connects to, making it practical to rapidly navigate the source code.  However, it was a common practice in some programming languages to use a variable in association with where the goto goes, making automated indexing impractical.  There are similar problems in some structured programming languages, such as how foreign language views are implemented, to permit many people to view the same computer data, in their human language.  

This contrasts with the idea of using some form of abstraction to understand how a program works - as in structured programming.

For this reason, it was suggested by Dijkstra that the goto statement should be banned.

== Structured programming ==

In one view it avoids using the dangerous goto statement. This prevents potentially confusing transfers of control.  Many structured programming languages support the goto statement, which can be used in a structured manner.  For example, to exit to the end of a routine, or return to the beginning of a loop.

In another view, structured programming confines itself to using control structures with only one entry point and one exit point. The most important of these structures are sequence, selection (if and if..else) and repetition (while).

Yet another view is that structured programs are programs written in such a way that they can be understood easily using abstraction. Abstraction means being able to understand the overall purpose of some code without understanding the detail. A prime mechanism for abstraction is the procedure (method). But the above-mentioned single-entry single-exit structures also help in using abstraction.

Structured programming was made possible by high-level languages and packages of related programs, that could be flow charted with software diagramming techniques understandable to non-programmers.

== The Inventors ==

A few computer scientists were responsible for discovering the idea of Structured Programming, and communicating this notion to the world of other programmers. Structured programming was first embodied in the ALGOL (Algorithmic Language) language (which became the first high-level language used for systems programming in the Burroughs B5000 MCP (OS), (designed by Bob Barton, later a professor at the University of Utah, where he influenced a student Alan Kay who invented the GUI window and was one of the developers of Smalltalk). In turn, ALGOL became the basis of Simula, the first object-oriented language.

ALGOL was based on a language design formalism called BNF (Backus-Naur Form) after its originators John Backus and Peter Naur.

The landmark book in the technique was &quot;Structured Programming&quot; (Academic Press 1972), which contained three sections: &quot;Notes on Structured Programming&quot; by Edsger W. Dijkstra, &quot;Notes on Data Structuring&quot; by C.A.R. Hoare, and &quot;Hierarchical Program Structures&quot; by Ole-Johan Dahl and C.A.R Hoare. The last section introduced Simula and its object-oriented and concurrency features.

Edsgar Djikstra also wrote the book &quot;A Discipline of Programming&quot; (Prentice Hall, 1976).

Another luminary in the structured programming world is Donald Knuth who wrote the multi-volume &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;.

Later a book called &quot;Structured Design&quot; was written by Ed Yourdon and Larry Constantine, which many consider is structured programming, but it is not. This was a graphical technique which was extremely tedious in practice, and although mostly abandoned has successors in other non-formal approaches such as UML. The technique outlined in Structured Design and Structured Programming are very different and should not be confused because they share the word Structured.

Genealogy research creates a mountain of paper. Even those who store their genealogy on a computer must have an organized method for indexing, storing, and retrieving documents. For people who do not use a computer, an efficient filing system is even more essential.

As mentioned in the [[../Recording your research|previous chapter]], a good filing system has these qualities:

== System is easy to understand, use, and maintain. ==
Nothing can waste more time than spending hours searching through mountains of paper to find a scrap of parchment you stored 5 years ago. Organized storage of your documents is essential.
more...

== All materials are stored securely and redundantly ==
Nothing can ruin years worth of work faster than a disaster to your archives. Fire, flood, tornado... they can destroy years worth of work and permanently eliminate original works forever. For this reason, you should secure your creation by keeping copies of your work in a separate location. Store original documents, such as family bibles, birth certificates, and photos in a safe or bank deposit box. Store only copies of the original in with your files.
more...

== Provides the ability to transport relevant data to research sites ==
;Original Documents

Your original documents have cost you time and trouble to gather, even if they are merely photocopies.  If they are old family bibles, or birth certificates from a county courthouse which has since burned down, they are irreplaceable.  As discussed elsewhere, irreplaceable documents need to be stored in a safe deposit box.  Your replaceable documents should remain safely at home in your files, together with hand- or photo-copies of the irreplaceable ones.  

;Take Information, Not Originals

When you are doing research, you need to know what you already know, to guide your search.   Since you will sometimes need to go to a library or archive to try to find the missing link in your family tree, you will need to be able to take with you the records which are relevant to your current search.  This could mean a printout from your computer data base, or it could mean extracting some pages from your three-ring binder.

The optimum might be to travel to the remote archive with a copy of your entire, computerized database on a notebook computer.  This may be impractical, for any of several reasons: you might not be able to bring your notebook computer into the archives, you might not bave a notebook computer, there might be no place to plug it in (and dead batteries), and so on.  Therefore your record-keeping system should allow you to extract what you know, or a subset of it, in a compact, easily accessible form. 

You might want to bring along copies of birth certificates, lists of dates (of birth, death, marriage, immigration, et cetera) and a copy of a family tree.  You could take photocopies, or abstracts of the information.  A computerised record keeping system which could print out an abstract of the information (and the sources from which it came) you have for some of the people in your database would be an enormous help.  So would a logical, up-to-date filing system which allows you to pull out that information.

== Facilitates the future publication / distribution of collected information ==
I do not understand this requirement, as the only criteria for it that I can imagine would be far better placed under the following topic.

(Could refer to being able to easily retrieve information for sketches, articles &amp; books.)

== Records complete sources for each document ==
Proper recording of the source for all your documents is very important. If the document is a copy, then you should record the location and work where that document came from. Both the location and the work should be very specific, allowing a complete stranger to both find the work, and the reference inside that work.
; location : The site or organization you got the work from. The full name and address should be specified. Try to remember that not everyone is from the same country as you, and to include the country in the address as well.
Examples:
:* Boston Public Library, McKim Building, 700 Boylston Street, Copley Square, Boston, MA 02116 US
:* Calvary Cemetary, 686 Fond du Lac Ave, Fond du Lac, WI 54935 US
:* All Saints Church, Hertford, England, UK
; work : The publication you are referencing. You should include the work, volume, page, and maybe even the line that your information came from. Include ranges as appropriate.  
Examples:
:* 1973 Brattleboro, VT phone book, page 132, second column, line 14
:* All Saints Marriage Register, volume covering 1822-1927, March 1824
Since genealogical records are often not commonly available, it doesn't hurt to include pointers to documents which are not available to the general public.  For example, the only reference to an ancestor might be a birth or marriage record in an old family bible.  In that case, an appropriate  reference might look like this:
:* Written on flyleaf of Surname family bible, in custody of Jane Surname, 123 Streetname, City, Country.</text>

Done using the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) survey.

'''US System'''

'''UK System''' 

The National Vegetation Classification is a system of classifying natural habitat types according to the vegetation they contain.  Different systems exist in different countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. 
A large scientific meeting of ecologists, botanists, and other related professionals in the United Kingdom resulted in the publication of a compendium of five books ISBN 0521797160 by Cambridge University Press which  detail the incidence of plant species in 5 major habitat types in the United Kingdom natural environment. They are the first systematic and comprehensive account of the vegetation types of this country. They cover all natural, semi-natural and major artificial habitats in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland), representing the fruits of fifteen years of research by leading plant ecologists.
From the data collated from the books was developed a commercial software product called 'MATCH' which helps to classify vegetation identified into one of the many habitat types found in Great Britain. [http://web.archive.org/web/20030521155917/biol.lancs.ac.uk/vegsci/what-nvc.htm]

The Intel 8051 microcontroller is one of the most popular general purpose microcontrollers in use today. The success of the Intel 8051 spawned a number of clones which are collectively referred to as the MCS-51 family of microcontrollers, which includes chips from vendors such as Atmel, Philips, Infineon, and Texas Instruments.

== About the 8051 ==

The Intel 8051 is an 8-bit microcontroller which means that most available operations are limited to 8 bits. There are 3 basic &quot;sizes&quot; of the 8051: Short, Standard, and Extended. The Short and Standard chips are often available in DIP (dual in-line package) form, but the Extended 8051 models often have a different form factor, and are not &quot;drop-in compatible&quot;. All these things are called 8051 because they can all be programmed using 8051 assembly language, and they all share certain features (although the different models all have their own special features). 

Some of the features that have made the 8051 popular are:
*4 KB on chip program memory.
*128 bytes on chip data memory(RAM)
[ 32 bank reg + 16 bit addressable reg + 80 general purpose reg ]
*4 reg banks.
*128 user defined software flags.
*8-bit data bus
*16-bit address bus
*16 bit timers (usually 2, but may have more, or less).
*3 internal and 2 external interrupts.
*Bit as well as byte addressable RAM area of 16 bytes.
*Four 8-bit ports, (short models have two 8-bit ports).
*16-bit program counter and data pointer.
*1 Microsecond instruction cycle with 12 MHz Crystal.

8051 models may also have a number of special, model-specific features, such as UART, ADC, Op_Amps, etc...
it is a very powerful micro controller.

== Typical applications ==

8051 chips are used in a wide variety of control systems, telecom applications, robotics as well as in the automotive industry. By some estimations, 8051 family chips make up over 50% of the embedded chip market.

[[Image:Pinouts8051.jpg|thumb|right|Pin diagram of the 8051 DIP]]

== Basic Pins ==

'''PIN 9''':
PIN 9 is the reset pin which is used to reset the microcontroller’s internal registers and ports upon starting up. (Pin should be held high for 2 machine cycles.)

'''PINS 18 &amp; 19''':
The 8051 has a built-in oscillator amplifier hence we need to only connect a crystal at these pins to provide clock pulses to the circuit.

'''PIN 40 and 20''':
Pins 40 and 20 are VCC and ground respectively. The 8051 chip needs +5V 500mA to function properly, although there are lower powered versions like the Atmel 2051 which is a scaled down version of the 8051 which runs on +3V.

'''PINS 29, 30 &amp; 31''':
As described in the features of the 8051, this chip contains a built-in flash memory. In order to program this we need to supply a voltage of +12V at pin 31. If external memory is connected then PIN 31, also called EA/VPP, should be connected to ground to indicate the presence of external memory.
PIN 30 is called ALE (address latch enable), which is used when multiple memory chips are connected to the controller and only one of them needs to be selected.We will deal with this in depth in the later chapters.
PIN 29 is called PSEN. This is &quot;program store enable&quot;. In order to use the external memory it is required to provide the low voltage (0) on both PSEN and EA pins.&lt;br&gt;

== Ports ==

There are 4 8-bit ports: P0, P1, P2 and P3.

'''PORT P1 (Pins 1 to 8)''':
The port P1 is a general purpose input/output port which can be used for a variety of interfacing tasks. The other ports P0, P2 and P3 have dual roles or additional functions associated with them based upon the context of their usage.The port 1 output buffers can sink/source four  TTL inputs.
When 1s are written to portn1 pins are pulled high by the internal pull-ups and can be used as inputs.

'''PORT P3 (Pins 10 to 17)''':
PORT P3 acts as a normal IO port, but Port P3 has additional functions such as, serial transmit and receive pins, 2 external interrupt pins, 2 external counter inputs, read and write pins for memory access. 

'''PORT P2 (pins 21 to 28)''':
PORT P2 can also be used as a general purpose 8 bit port when no external memory is present, but if external memory access is required then PORT P2 will act as an address bus in conjunction with PORT P0 to access external memory. PORT P2 acts as A8-A15, as can be seen from fig 1.1

'''PORT P0 (pins 32 to 39)'''
PORT P0 can be used as a general purpose 8 bit port when no external memory is present, but if external memory access is required then PORT P0 acts as a multiplexed address and data bus that can be used to access external memory in conjunction with PORT P2. P0 acts as AD0-AD7, as can be seen from fig 1.1

'''PORT P10''':
asynchronous communication input or Serial synchronous communication output.

== Oscillator Circuits ==

The 8051 requires an external oscillator circuit. The oscillator circuit usually runs around 12MHz, although the 8051 (depending on which specific model) is capable of running at a maximum of 40MHz. Each machine cycle in the 8051 is 12 clock cycles, giving an effective cycle rate at 1MHz (for a 12MHz clock) to 3.33MHz (for the maximum 40MHz clock).
The oscillator circuit generates the clock pulses so that all internal operations are synchronized.

One machine cycle has 6 states. One state is 2 T-states. Therefore one machine cycle is 12 T-states.
Time to execute an instruction is found by multiplying C by 12 and dividing product by Crystal frequency.
:T=(C*12d)/crystal frequency

== Internal Architecture ==

[[Image:Intel_8051_arch.svg|thumb|center|723px|Internal schematics of the 8051.]]

== Data and Program Memory ==

The 8051 Microcontroller can be programmed in PL/M, 8051 Assembly, C and a number of other high-level languages. Many compilers even have support for compiling C++ for an 8051.

Program memory in the 8051 is read-only, while the data memory is considered to be read/write accessible. When stored on EEPROM or Flash, the program memory can be rewritten when the microcontroller is in the special programmer circuit.

== Program Start Address ==

The 8051 starts executing program instructions from address 0000 in the program memory.
The A register is located in the SFR memory location 0xE0. The A register works in a similar fashion to the AX register of x86 processors. The A register is called the accumulator, and by default it receives the result of all arithmetic operations.

== Special Function Register ==

The '''Special Function Register''' (SFR) is the upper area of addressable memory, from address 0x80 to 0xFF.  A, B, PSW, DPTR are called SFR.This area of memory cannot be used for data or program storage, but is instead a series of memory-mapped ports and registers. All port input and output can therefore be performed by memory '''mov''' operations on specified addresses in the SFR. Also, different status registers are mapped into the SFR, for use in checking the status of the 8051, and changing some operational parameters of the 8051.

=== General Purpose Registers ===

The 8051 has 4 selectable banks of 8 addressable 8-bit registers, R0 to R7. This means that there are essentially 32 available general purpose registers, although only 8 (one bank) can be directly accessed at a time. To access the other banks, we need to change the current bank number in the  flag register.

=== A and B Registers ===

The A register is located in the SFR  memory location 0xE0. The A register works in a similar fashion to the AX register of x86 processors. The A register is called the '''accumulator''', and by default it receives the result of all arithmetic operations. The B register is used in a similar manner, except that it can receive the extended answers from the multiply and divide operations. When not being used for multiplication and Division, the B register is available as an extra general-purpose register. The A and B registers can store up to 8-bits of data each.</text>

'''What is the difference between a surface model and a solid model?'''

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;A surface can be open e.g. it does not completely enclose a volume&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;A surface has no thickness&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;A solid is a special type of surface model. The CAD system knows where the inside is. Therefore the CAD system will know whether a given point in space is inside or outside of the solid. &lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Solids can be created from closed surfaces&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Thin solid can be produced from most surfaces&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

'''Is there a need for surfaces?'''
&lt;P&gt;There are lots of geometry shapes that cannot be produced any other way. Surfaces are a cleaner way to produce certain types of feature.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Are surfaces difficult to master?'''
&lt;P&gt;Not really. Once you understand the terminology the are no more difficult that than solid features, in fact extrude, revolve, blend and sweep are created in exactly the same way as their solid counterparts.&lt;/P&gt;
'''What are the Magenta and Yellow lines in Pro/ENGINEER 2001 and earlier?'''
&lt;P&gt;In wireframe and hidden line views, surfaces are displayed with tangential edges as magenta (double-sided surfaces). Surface edges, cuts, are displayed as yellow (single-sided surfaces).&lt;/P&gt;
'''How do I stop surfaces cluttering the screen?'''
&lt;P&gt;If you use automatic layers then blank the surface layer. If you use manual layers create a layer, add the surfaces to the layers using the &lt;B&gt;Feature, All of Type&lt;/B&gt; option, then blank that layer.&lt;/P&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Symmetrical Models'''
When creating symmetrical surface models only model half and transform, mirror it. Use insert mode to add features before the mirror feature.

'''Merging'''
Merge surfaces at the end of the model where possible, the model will be more robust. 

'''Avoid 2 and 3 sided boundary surfaces'''
Avoid using 2 and 3 sided boundary surfaces. Use 4 boundaries to get the best quality surfaces in pro/engineer otherwise downstream features such as solids and offsets may not work correctly. see [[Surfaces:Avoiding 3 sided boundaries]]


'''Do not use boundary surfaces to create flat surfaces'''
Using boundary surfaces to create flat surfaces will not result in perfectly flat surfaces.

'''Tips for creating datum curves for use with boundary surfaces'''
Avoid 2 projection curves as it is almost impossible to control the tangency conditions at the curve ends. If 2 projections are used try to line up intersections of the sub curves, otherwise the resulting curves will have lots of segments.

Avoid curve intersecting surfaces for the same reason.

Try to use curve, thru points because you can control the tangency of the curve. It is also possible to tweak the curve and pull it into the right shape.  Or use a curve from ISDX as a single feature.

When creating curves for the 'same dir' of a boundary surface try to create it with a similar number of segments. This can be achieved by using divide in sketcher.

Build the datum curves with the same tangency conditions as required in the boundary surfaces.

When creating splines (and ISDX curves) use the minimum number of points, this reduces the risks of introducing ripples into the curve. (unless of course you want ripples!)

'''Use colours'''
Set surfaces to a shiny black as this shows up the shape of reflected highlights. The outline of highlights should be smooth if not the surface is probably not smooth.

&lt;P&gt;Suppressing a feature or component using family table will suppress all children automatically. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Create features in instances'''
&lt;P&gt;Creating features in an instance will automatically suppress the feature/ component in the generic and add the items to the family table. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Don't use the generic as an instance'''
&lt;P&gt;Create an instance for each model required e.g one for casting, one for machining: avoid creating one instance (machining) and then using the generic as the casting instance. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Tolerances can be added to family table'''
&lt;P&gt;Display tolerances, &lt;B&gt;Family Table, Add Item, Dimension&lt;/B&gt; pick the required dimension and the tolerance figures. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Add parameters instead of dimensions'''
&lt;P&gt;Adding parameters to the family table instead of dimension enable you to drive many dimensions/ features from a single column in the family table. e.g. a bolt family with different bolt heads, the thickness of the head can be driven by one parameter (head_thickness) instead of adding a dimension for each type of bolt head. Each bolt head thickness dimension has the relation d**=head_thickness. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Patterns'''
&lt;P&gt;Complex features such as patterns can be added either by adding individual pattern dimensions or by adding pattern tables to the family table. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Reduce generic part load time'''
&lt;P&gt;If a feature/component is only used in a few instances suppress that feature/component in the generic to reduce load/regeneration times. Generic assemblies could have all components suppressed in the generic. Parts can also have all features suppressed in the generic. Features and components are then added at the instance level. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Create the family table at the end'''
&lt;P&gt;Each instance has to be regenerated after certain operations, this can cause long regenerations. Complete the majority of features before constructing the family table. &lt;/P&gt;
'''Verify'''
&lt;P&gt;Always verify a family table before saving to Intralink. Intralink will issue a warning if instances are not verified &lt;/P&gt;
'''Don't leave default values in family table'''
&lt;P&gt;Fill in all values do not leave * (the * denotes the value will be the same as the generic) in the family table otherwise instances may change unintentionally when the generic is modified.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Reorder Features'''
&lt;P&gt;Reorder the features that change via the family table to be as late as possible in the model tree - this will improve performance and regeneration.&lt;/P&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Configuration'''
&lt;P&gt;Remove search paths and search.pro from pro/engineer configuration files (both local and global config files)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Remove PRO_FORMAT_DIR from the config.pro. Check out formats from commonspace.&lt;/P&gt;
'''File Manipulation'''
&lt;P&gt;Never try to manipulate files at the operating system level.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Only use Pro/engineer linked to Intralink to open and modify Intralink controlled files.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clean temporary files from start up directory&lt;/P&gt;
'''Check In and Check Out'''
&lt;P&gt;Check in the latest version of an object when someone else needs it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Check files in regularly. This will store a design history and the file will be backed up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Adminstrators should set access to the root directory as read only to force users to set a destination directory.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Only check in the files you intended to change - review the checkin form and remove any that should not have been modified.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Family Tables'''
&lt;P&gt;Check out the generic and all instances before the modification of family table driven parts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Verify family tables before checking in to Intralink.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Workspace'''
&lt;P&gt;Create a new workspace for each new task. When finished delete the workspace. This will reduce disk usage and minimise 'check in' conflicts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Check the status of an object before working on it. This will avoid check in conflicts and having to use Integrate.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Frames'''
&lt;P&gt;Turn on frames. This will enable you to undo mistakes easily.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Pro/Engineer'''
&lt;P&gt;Use Intralink to rename objects it is safer than Pro/Engineer as Pro/Engineer will only update objects that are in session. Intralink will update all objects it knows about.&lt;/P&gt;
'''Viewing Objects Without Opening Pro/Engineer '''
&lt;p&gt;Highlight the object (drawing, part or assembly) click &lt;strong&gt;Object, Information&lt;/strong&gt; a preview of the object is shown in a small window. Click the upward arrow to show the image full size. 3D objects in the small image and large window can be rotated by holding down the middle mouse button and moving the mouse. Holding down the ctrl + MMB zooms the object and shift + MMB pans the object. &lt;/p&gt;

Verbs are the most variable words in the Portuguese Language, so they are much more complex than the English verbs. Portuguese verbs vary on mood, tense, voice, number and aspect.

==Mood==
Any verb that expresses a desire in some form can be used to introduce the subjunctive. Doubt, denial, emotion, wish, hope, suggestion, certainty, supposition, recommendation are other examples.  It is also used after indirect commands. In Portugal, the subjunctive (subjunctivo) is called the conjunctive (conjuntivo).  (More details below).

The Indicative Mood is the opposite and refers to statements of fact or certainty.

The Imperative Mood is used for commands.

==Tense==
The present, preterite, and future tenses refer to a fact that is occurring in the moment in which one is speaking, before the moment in which one is speaking, or after the moment in which one is speaking, respectively.

==Aspect ==
The aspect is the speaker's point of view of the action expressed by the verb.  The word Imperfect comes from the Latin &quot;imperfectum&quot; which means &lt;i&gt;not completed&lt;/i&gt;.  This is often a source of confusion when studying Portuguese because this has no relation at all with what is considered the imperfect aspect of a verb.

== Mood, Tense, and Aspect ==
The following table explains each of the the moods, tenses and aspects of Portuguese verbs.  The first four columns represents a typology often found in Portuguese grammar books.  As they are best understood when they are used together, the following table displays all the variations&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| &lt;b&gt;Mood&lt;/b&gt; ||  &lt;b&gt;Tense&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;Aspect&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;simple/compound&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;Example in English&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;Verb in Portuguese&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;Explanation&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| Indicative || Present || N/A || N/A || I study today || estudo || Action in the present
|
|-
| Indicative || Preterite || Imperfect || N/A || I was studying while watching T.V.  I used to study every day || estudava; estava estudando || Action began, continued and ended in the past.  It relates to a continuous action or describes the state of things over a period of time in the past.  Note: Also known as the Imperfect Indicative.
| 
|-
| Indicative || Preterite || Perfect || simple || I studied last night.  I have studied already. || estudei || A single action completed in the past.  Note: Also known as the Preterite Indicative.
| 
|-
| Indicative || Preterite || Perfect || compound || I have studied a lot lately.  I have been studying since last week. I have repeatedly studied all semester. || tenho estudado; estiveram estudando|| An action started in the past and continuing into the present.  &quot;Have studied&quot; can only be translated as &quot;tenho estudado&quot; if there is a contextualizing element indicating the action is still continuing (I have studied all semester long; I have studied this since yesterday).  There are other ways of forming this tense by using the present indicative (e.g. estudo) with other contextualizing elements in the sentence such as (e.g. Ha um ano que eu estudo portugues, Desde que..., Ha mais de dois anos...).  See &quot;Present Perfect&quot; below for more information.  Note:  Also known as Present Perfect Progressive/Continuous Indicative.
| 
|-
| Indicative || Preterite || Pluperfect || simple || Yesterday, I had studied before I went to school. || estudara || An action in the past before another action in the past. Largely a literary form.  In English, only the compound form exists (see next item below) Note: Also known as Simple Pluperfect Indicative.
| 
|-
|  Indicative || Preterite || Pluperfect || compound || Yesterday, I had studied before I went to school. || Tinha estudado || An action in the past before another action in the past (just like in English).  Note: Also known as Past Perfect or Pluperfect Indicative.
| 
|-
| Indicative || Future || Of the Present || simple || I will study tomorrow.  I'm going to study tomorrow || estudarei/vou estudar || An action that will happen in the future
| 
|-
| Indicative || Future || Of the Present || compound || By 6:00pm tomorrow, I will have studied everything || terei estudado; vou ter estudado || An action in the future in relation to another action in the future.  Note:  Also known as the Future Perfect Indicative.
| 
|-
| Indicative || Future || Of the Preterite || simple || I would/should study tomorrow || estudaria || An action intended in the future.  Note:  Some grammar books refer to this as the conditional mood or simple conditional or just conditional.
| 
|-
| Indicative || Future || Of the Preterite || compound || If I had seen the test, I would have studied more. || teria estudado || An action intended in the future. Note:  Also known as the Conditional Perfect.
| 
|-
| Subjunctive || Present || N/A || N/A || I may study today.  Maybe I will study today. I want/need you to study. I hope that I will study tomorrow. It is a shame that I study all the time.  I hope that I will study tomorrow.|| estude || desire, doubt, hope, emotion, suggestion, that one has now about a present or future action. Also for indirect commands.
| 
|-
| Subjunctive || Preterite || Imperfect || N/A || I would like you to study with me today.  I wanted you to study with me yesterday.|| estudasse || desire, doubt, hope, emotion, suggestion, about an action in the past, present, or future.  This is always used in the subordinate clause with the verb in the main clause usually being in the Imperfect Indicative, the Preterite Indicative, the Conditional, or Present.
| 
|-
| Subjunctive || Preterite || Perfect || N/A || Maybe I had studied too much yesterday. I doubt that she had studied yesterday.  I'm sorry that I hadn't studied more. You probably will have studied for your test by noon.|| tenha estudado || desire, doubt, hope, emotion, suggestion, about a fact in the past supposedly concluded or a fact in the future terminated in relation to another fact in the future.  Always conjugated with help of verb ter.  Note: Also known as Present Perfect Subjunctive.
| 
|-
| Subjunctive || Preterite || Pluperfect || N/A || I would be happier if I had studied before I went to work. If I had studied more, I would have scored better.  I would not have cheated if you had studied with me.  || tivesse estudado || desire, doubt, hope, emotion, suggestion, about an action in the past before another action in the past or a past condition in relation to a fact in the past that hasn't occurred.  Also, what you would have done in the past if things had been different.  Note: Also known as the Past Perfect Subjunctive or Pluperfect Subjunctive.
|
|-
| Subjunctive || Future || N/A || simple || If I study tomorrow, I will know everything || estudar || desire, doubt, hope, emotion, suggestion, about the eventuality of a future action.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  It can also be used for uncertain present reality (details below).
|
|-
| Subjunctive || Future || N/A || compound || Tomorrow I will be ready if ,by then, I have studied everything.  When/As soon as I have studied everything, I will go to Brazil. || tiver estudado || desire, doubt, hope, emotion, suggestion, about the eventuality of a future action.  Note: Also known as the Future Perfect Subjunctive.
|
|-
| Imperative || Present || N/A || N/A || Study the book, students! || estudem || commands
|
|-
|
|-
| N/A || N/A || N/A || N/A || I will be studying during class tomorrow! || estarei estudando || Future Progressive/Continuous.  An action starting in the future and continuing in the future usually in relation to some other future event.
|
|-
|
|-
| N/A || N/A || N/A || N/A || I had been studying during classes all day yesterday! || tinha estado estudando || Past Perfect Progressive/Continuous.  An action starting in the past and continuing in the past and ending in the past usually in relation to some other past event.  These longer constructions are not very natural-sounding and occur infrequently.
|
|-
|
|-
| N/A || N/A || N/A || N/A || I have studied for this test already! || (ja) estudei || Present Perfect.  An action starting in the past and continuing up to the present where it stops but still has some sort of effect.  This tense is best explained [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_perfect_tense here.]There is no correspondence in Portuguese so the simple preterite is used sometimes preceded by &quot;ja&quot;.  The only exception to this is &quot;should have studied&quot; -- devia ter estudado
|
|-

|}
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are some special treatments of participles (see below).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The future subjunctive is formed by taking the 3rd person past tense form of any verb and dropping the &quot;am&quot;.  For the 1st person plural add &quot;mos&quot; and for the 3rd person plural add &quot;em&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

'''GENERAL RULES:'''

It is first important to understand the difference between a main clause and subordinate clause in order to understand when the subjunctive is used.  More on clauses can be found [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Sentences#Sentence_Structure here].  Usually the subordinate clause is used after que, other conjunctions (e.g. embora, porque, se, quando, etc.) or relative pronouns (cujo, quem, qual, onde, etc.).

* The subjunctive is used in the main clause when the verb in the clause expresses a curse or a wish or when it begins with the word &quot;maybe&quot; (talvez)
* Any wish, intention or purpose in the main clause that expresses the desire to influence the action in the subordinate clause necessitates the use of the subjunctive.
* When the verb in the main clause expresses denial, doubt or uncertainty, presupposition, or emotion about the action in the subordinate clause, the verb in the subordinate clause must use the subjunctive.
* Certain conjunctions introducing a subordinate clause require the indicative to be used in the subordinate clause (e.g. visto que (given that), porque (because), dado que (given that), ja que (now that), assim como (in the same way that)).  Others require the use of the subjunctive.  (e.g. the following require the use of the present or imperfect subjunctive: caso (in case), antes que (before), ainda que/posto que (although or even if), unless (a nao ser que or a menos que), a que (to), in order to (a fim de que), unless or without (sem que), para que (so that, in order to), even if (mesmo que, nem que), although (embora), provided that (contanto que), as soon as (logo que/assim que)).
* You can use the indicative or the subjunctive in sentences where the following verbs are negated (preceded by nao):  achar, crer, sonhar, revelar, mencionar, alegar, aununciar, confirmar, comunicar, contar, informar.

'''SOME SPECIFICS BASED ON THE GENERAL RULES:'''


* If the verb in the main clause is in the indirect command form or expressing desire or emotion in the present, the verb in the subordinate clause will be in the present subjunctive.  

**I hope (desejo: present indicative) that you accompany (acompanhem:  present subjunctive) me.  – these are indirect commands or verbs that express a desire or emotion somewhow.  They require the use of the present subjunctive after them (e.g. I hope that…, I want that…, I need that…, I suggest that..., I recommend that..., I insist in that..., I permit that, It is important that..., It is better that..., It's a pity that..., It's sad that...It's ridiculous that..., It's strange that..., I'm upset that..., I deny that...).  

** Use with verbs such as sugerir (to suggest), permitir (to permit), recomendar (to recomend), insistir em (to insist), É preciso que... (it is nesscessary that), É importante que...(it is important that), É melhor que... (it is better that) and others.  


* If the verb in the main clause is in the present or imperative, the verb in the subordinate clause will be in the present subjunctive or the imperfect subjunctive depending on whether the verb in the main clause refers to a present event or a past one respectively.  

**I doubt (duvido: present indicative) that they speak (falem: present subjunctive) very well. – This refers to a present situation so the present subjunctive is used.

**They doubt (duvidam: present indicative) that my mother was (estivesse: imperfect subjunctive) at the house.  – This refers to a past situation so the imperfect subjunctive is used.  

** Study (estude: imperative) now so that you can learn (aprenda: present subjunctive) more Portuguese.

* The imperfect subjunctive or pluperfect subjunctive is used after &quot;como se&quot; (as if).  

** My friend was speaking (falava: imperfect indicative) as if he was (fosse: imperfect subjunctive) an important person.

** They speak (falam: present indicative) as if they are (fossem: imperfect subjunctive) lawyers.

** My sister ate (comeu: preterite indicative) as if she hadn't eaten (tivesse comido: pluperfect subjunctive) in three years.


*  If the verb in the main clause is in the future,  the verb in the subordinate clause will be in the present subjunctive or the future subjunctive.

** Before I see (veja: present subjunctive) him, I will tell (direi: future indicative) my husband everything.  

** When she comes (vier: future subjunctive), I will be (estarei:  future indicative) in California.

*When the if-clause refers to a future occurrence, the future subjunctive is used in the if-clause:  

** If I have (tiver: future subjunctive) a boyfriend, I will take (farei: future indicative) him to brazil.
** If you can (puder: future subjunctive), arrive (chegue: present subjunctive) as late as possible to the party.

*  &quot;While&quot; followed by a reference to a future situation requires future subjunctive in the while-clause.

** While you are (estiver: future subjunctive) not feeling well, stay (fique: present subjunctive) with me.

* Doubt about a present reality sometimes necessitates the future subjunctive:

**I'm not sure if you want to or not (...se voce quiser...)
**I'm not sure if you can or not. (...se voce puder...)
**If she perfers... (Se ela preferir...)
**As you wish...(Como voce quiser...)
**Wherever you wish....(Onde voce quiser)


*  &quot;When&quot; followed by a reference to a future situation requires future subjunctive in the when-clause:

** When you know (souber: future subjunctive) the day of the test, tell (diga: present subjunctive) me.

* The translation of wherever, whenever, whoever, and whatever require the use of the Future Subjunctive:

** You can love whoever you wish (quiseres: future subjunctive).

* The future subjunctive is also used with &quot;as soon as you wish&quot; (assim que quiseres/logo que) and &quot;as you wish&quot; (como quiseres).


*  If the the verb in the main clause is in the past (e.g. preterite indicative, imperfect indicative) or the simple conditional, the verb in the subordinate clause will be in the imperfect or the past perfect.

** I would like you (queria: conditional) to have dinner (viesses jantar:  imperfect subjunctive) with me tomorrow or next week.  

**I wanted (quis: preterite indicative) you to have dinner (viesses jantar:  imperfect subjunctive) with me last week.  

** I didn’t believe (acreditei: preterite indicative) that he had sold (tivesse vendido: past perfect subjunctive) everything.  

**I wanted (desejava: imperfect indicative) him to be (estivesse: imperfect subjunctive) with me everywhere.


* If the &quot;if&quot; condition can't be met (i.e. doesn't imply a real fact) and the sentence refers to a present situation, the imperfect subjunctive is used in the if clause and the conditional or imperfect indicative is used in the main clause:

** If I had (tivesse: imperfect subjunctive), I would take (faria or fazia: conditional or imperfect indicative) a vacation in Rio de Janeiro.


* If the &quot;if&quot; condition can't be met (i.e. doesn't imply a real fact) and the sentence refers to a past situation (what could have been), the past perfect subjunctive is used in the if-clause and the conditional perfect (or simple pluperfect indicative) in the main clause:

** If I had had (tivesse tido: past perfect subjunctive) a girlfriend, I would have taken (teria feito or tinha feito:  conditional perfect or pluperfect indicative) her to Brazil.

== More on Participles ==
The verb forms with participles are those with &quot;estudado&quot; listed above. Here are two important topics regarding participles:

* The participle stays the same in the active voice (like #1) but agrees with the subject in the passive voice (#2 and #4) except when using the passive voice with ter or haver (#3, #5, #6).

# A professora ja tinha ido.
# Algumas pessoas foram atingidas pelo meu carro. 
# Os cavalos nos quais eu tinha andado estavam vividos. 
# A rua foi feita um ano atras. 
# Os problemas tinham partido da minha alma. 
# A carta que eu havia escrito foi longa. 

* Some verbs have two particple forms.  Examples of verbs with two participles are:

aceitar - aceitado - aceito&lt;br&gt; 
acender - acendido - aceso &lt;br&gt;
contundir - contundido - contuso &lt;br&gt;
eleger - elegido - eleito &lt;br&gt;
entregar - entregado - entregue &lt;br&gt;
enxugar - enxugado - enxuto &lt;br&gt;
expulsar - expulsado - expulso &lt;br&gt;
imprimir - imprimido - impresso &lt;br&gt;
limpar - limpado - limpo &lt;br&gt;
murchar - murchado - murcho &lt;br&gt;
suspender - suspendido - suspenso &lt;br&gt;
tingir - tingido - tinto &lt;br&gt;
findar - findado - findo&lt;br&gt;
isentar - isentado - isento&lt;br&gt;
matar - matado - morto&lt;br&gt;
salvar - salvado - salvo&lt;br&gt;
segurar - segurado - seguro&lt;br&gt;
soltar - soltado - solto&lt;br&gt;
benzer - benzido - bento&lt;br&gt;
morrer - morrido - morto&lt;br&gt;
prender - prendido - preso&lt;br&gt;
suspender - suspendido - suspenso&lt;br&gt;
emergir - emergido - emerso&lt;br&gt;
expelir - expelido - expulso&lt;br&gt;
exprimir - exprimido - expresso&lt;br&gt;
inserir - inserido - inserto&lt;br&gt;
omitir - omitido - omisso&lt;br&gt;
submergir - submergido - submerso&lt;br&gt; 
juntar - juntado - junto&lt;br&gt;
trazer - trazido - trago&lt;br&gt;

**ter/haver in front of the verb to form the perfect tenses use the first form (e.g. juntado).
**ser/estar in front of the verb (more adjectivial in nature) use the second form (e.g. junto).

==Nominal Forms==

These are forms of a verb that are characterized by not having an indication of time or of mood depending always on the context in which they're found.  In these nominal forms, the verbs can themselves function as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.
{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| Infinitive || &lt;i&gt;Infinitivo&lt;/i&gt;
| When expressing the idea of the action of the verb, the infinitive is used. Just like in English, it is also used as the name of the verb.  This comes in two forms, the personal and the impersonal.  The former is when it refers to a subject and the latter when it doesn't.
|-
| Participle || &lt;i&gt;Particípio&lt;/i&gt;
| Used to form compound tenses.  This represents the result of the action expressed by the verb and accumulating the characteristics of the verb as an adjective.  You have eyes buried...(poetically).  Tens os olhos encovados...
|-
| Gerund || &lt;i&gt;Gerúndio&lt;/i&gt;
| A type of Present Participle which is using in special conjugations called '''Conjugações Perifrásticas'''.  This is the function of the verb being expressed as an adverb or adjective.  Chegando a manha, continuamos.
|}

&lt;u&gt;More on the Infinitive&lt;/u&gt;:

The infinitive has many uses.  The impersonal infinitive has one form: the one you see in the dictionary that ends in –ar, -er, or –ir.   Here are some uses of the impersonal infinitive:

* Driving (Dirigir) is fun. – when it is the subject of clauses
* I need to drive (dirigir).  I am going to drive (vou dirigir) – coupled with other verbs.
* I am learning now.  (estou a aprender).  This is another form of the present continuous and is the same as “estou aprendendo”.
* I am happy being (ficar) with you.  – Complementing nouns and adjectives.
* They were forced to stop.  (Eles foram forcados a parar).  – verb in the passive voice with preposition is followed by the impersonal infinitive.
* I stated that I was prepared (disse estar preparadas) for the examination.-- When the main and subordinating clauses have the same subject.
* And he yelled, “Stop” (Parar) – substituting for the imperative

There are also Personal Infinitives which are less used in spoken language than in writing.  They are used when there are infinitive verb constructions but the subject of this verb is not very clear.  Therefore the infinfitive is &quot;personalized&quot; to make clear who the subject is.  It is formed by:

* Adding a subject in front of the singular infinitive forms:
** Eu sair -- Before I leave, I want to talk to her.
** Voce sair -- Before you leave, I want to talk to her.

* Adding endings to the plural infinitive forms:
** infinitive + mos for first person plural
** infinitive + em for third person plural

Here are some uses for the personal infinitive:

* They regret that we are (estarmos) not here.  When the main and subordinating clauses have different subjects.
* It’s necessary for me to buy (eu comprar) another car.  It’s easy for them to arrive (elas chegarem) early. It’s impossible for you to leave now (voce entrar) – Used after impersonal expressions.  In these sentences “for” is not translated.
* When they opened (Ao abrirem eles) the card, they saw the picture.  Used after ate, antes de, depois de, ao (translated as when or upon), a fim de, sem, para

__TOC__

== Guidelines and Direction ==

Each chapter should follow this pattern:

 == chapter == 
 === section == 
 ==== exercises for section ==== 

Answers for the exercises belong in the (currently empty) answers appendix.

Generally, I suggest we keep the number of chapters small, but have lots of sections.

There's a C programming appendix at the end that covers some stuff people might not know about C.

== pseudocode vs. real code ==

While functional examples are great, sometimes it's best to introduce a topic with psuedo-code.

Additionally, you may be interested in [http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~beej/guide/ Beej's Guides], which I've found to be particuarly useful.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 06:59, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Thanks for the Beej link!  Another site I really like is [http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/CE.html this guy's], and he covers just about everything.

--[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 02:36, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Named pipes and locks ==

Consider adding sections for named pipes and locks (eg sephamores, mutex).  Granted the latter you'll probably cover in the threads section, but locks should at least be their own subsection.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 17:56, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Yeah, I just added some example mutex code today.  I'm typing this stuff in as the class progresses.

== goals for this book ==

I would consider naming this something else than &quot;Distributed Systems&quot;. That is far too general term for Unix thread/process intercommunication software development and TCP/IP protocols. If you really want to make a book on this subject, its not just Ethernet/TCP/IP-based distribution (message passing) - what about CANopen, Lin, Profinet, EPL, etc. Also, we are not talking about sensor networks, control systems, ...

--Mikko Laakso

I agree that *currently*, this book seems to be almost entirely about multitasking on a single box, and &quot;distributed systems&quot; is a much larger field.

However, I really do want a book on distributed systems.
So the stuff you see on &quot;multitasking on a single box&quot; is merely one chapter of what I hope this book becomes.

How can I make clear that this is still a rough draft, and there are still a lot of other sections yet to be written?
How can I persuade people to write those other sections?

p.s.: There currently seems to be a lot of overlap with [[Computer programming/Concurrent programming]] [[Parallel Computing and Computer Clusters]].
So I expect that someday, after both have matured a bit, that several pages from this book will be moved into those books, and a few pages from those books will be moved into this &quot;Distributed Systems&quot; book.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:44, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

I still think this book needs a better focus to be really useful. That would help and steer writing this book as well. Focus on one, more limited, subject instead scraping the top of everything. And perhaps later, would be good to make it clear for everybody by re-inventing the name.

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Benc. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Benc~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Use the above given alphabet to read the whole VMs. If for any reason it is decided to reverse the transliteration than remove the vowels and replace the consonants with VMs alphabet given in table above. Although if you will be more comfortable to work with English alphabet you can replace Ukrainian consonants with English using the above given alphabet table &lt;ref&gt;[http://or-ch-blog.blogspot.com/2010_10_01_archive.html Cyrillic and Latin alphabets J. Stojko]&lt;/ref&gt;. Or you can replace my transliteration in Ukrainian with English alphabet. To do that use alphabet table above for consonant and for vowels and correct phonetic value of the words use table in my Home Page http://home.att.net/~oko/home.htm
To obtain meaning of Ukrainian words in English use Ukrainian – English dictionary.
Except for names you will find meaning for all the words used in VMs.
Bellow is given translation of page 18R.
 

18R in Ukrainian ф\
1. Що Око робе заре косе? Хиба Орів хапа. Був, бору і суть повіли. Око боре в злі. Попита се. Ви пита віру Кагалу?

2.   Вість одновили і світу повіли. Пише то пишу. Ви те побили Око божиє косе.Повіло  Око Бозйа.

3.   У свьату по вірі повір і повіта нашу віру і панусьу. Свьаті повіли косо. Се што поборе зло?
 
4. По вірі поставе Орі і увітеа онову Ора. Се то повіли ви та Бозя.

5. Што повірі повіру у пусті божиї. Пусто вола половили і повезли.

6. Се пишу то повір. Хиба заре се што вола попустиш. Око боре, Ока бере і Око було.

7. В одновір одне божиє. Пошто се повіла? Око вола, вала косо, хвали Око божиє.

8. Свьата по вірі пита волі. Вольа в Коси. Ви то були коси а Око береш.

9.   Повіли і попусту були. Ви то одні були і пише та булака.

10.  Око боре одну віру. Се ви то повіли?  Волі се Око божиє?

11.  Де в Степу бажає. Пові та пиши. Попита вольу по вірі Коса.

12.  Усі по базару поставили. Око божиє і Свьата пише пусте се.

13.  Віру одну бажайе пустовіри. Пусті були ви та буле у Око бере .

14.  Се Понті пиши та побажай.


                             18R in English   
1. What slanted Oko is doing now? Perhaps Ora’s people you are snatching. I was, I am fighting and told the truth. Oko you are fighting mischievously (evil manner). Ask this. Are you asking religion for your clan?

2. We renewed the information (news) and told to the world. He wrote and I am writing. You broke this slanted eye of God. Oko Bozia (Baby God) answered.

3. In believe she is holy and you should believe and welcome our religion and Miss. The holy told in slanted way. Is that the evil that will be victorious?

4. In religion we decide for Ora and Ora will welcome the renovation. What a news you and Bozia told.

5. That in religion I will believe in god’s emptiness. Empty (vain) is your calling, we caught (snatched) and carted away.

6. What I am writing you should believe. Perhaps now that what you are calling you will relinquish, Oko is fighting, Oko is victorious and Oko was.

7. In one religion only one is gods. For what reason Kosa (slant) is telling us? Oko is calling slanted, praise the God’s Oko.

8. In believe her holiness is asking for freedom. Kosa has the freedom. You were slants and now you are taking Oko.

9. You are saying but you were idlers. You were alone but you are writing and talking.

10. Oko is fighting for one religion. You told this. Do you won’t this God’s Oko?

11. Where do you wont in Steppe? Tell and write. Kosa should ask for freedom in religion.

12. Every one was vain in the marked place. God’s Oko and (she) holy one is writing this emptiness.

13. Vain believers are wishing one religion. You are vain therefore you are taking Oko that was.

14. Write this to Pontia and wish him.


Now please read the meaning of the VMs in English or if you speak Ukrainian in Ukrainian. After reading you will and you should make conclusion what is this all about. I do not know what your conclusion will be but I believe that I should explain my understanding of the VMs text. 
Some one in authority received letter and he reads and dictates to his scribe what answer he should write. From time to time he gives phrases from his letter that provoked the other side response and than give phrase what he desired in the answer.
For example: I will take line 1.
1.  In his letter he wrote “What slanted Oko is doing now?” And than gives his answer, “Perhaps Ora’s people you are snatching”. He received the following answer, “I was, I am fighting and I told the truth”.  Now he wants the scribe to write in this answer “Oko you are fighting mischievously (in evil manner). And than he order the scribe “Ask this” and give the phrase “Are you asking religion for your clan?”

After reading the letter and stating to the scribe what he want to be included in the answer, he gives the following order. See line 14.
“Write this to Pontia and wish him”

From the other pages in VMs where is stated that Pontia was Median King or general that come with his army to help Miss Mania Koza and her son Sus to fight Ora’s army.
When the VMs were written is not known. But it is good indication that VMs was written at the time when Media was strong and the King of Media or general Pontia was known for his glory in history. The Black Sea was named after him. The Greek to the present time call Black Sea Pontus.
I doubt that the original notes of the scribe survived in its original form. It seems that the original notes were rewritten. If the VMs were original it would be written by the same hand writing. Although I am not hand writing expert however, I do recognize more than one hand writing. Who and when the VMs was rewritten, probably we will never know. But it can be stated that, at that time it was known what it contain. Also they knew the alphabet and language in which the VMs were written.

Whether the original was in poor shape or the political time dictated.
That the writing should be preserved for the future. 
It was rewritten and the pictures were added for deceptions.
That I do know. Many hours I spent trying to decipher to decipher looking for name or clue in the pictures. When I succeeded deciphering the alphabet and started to read than I realized that the writing has nothing to do with the pictures. Yes, it is ingenious deception to mask true contents in VMs.

== Introduction ==

=== General ===
This content is part of the [[Serial Programming]] book. It covers the programming of Hayes and Hayes-compatible telephone modems. Such types of modems are the norm in consumer applications, as well as many professional applications - basically, wherever modems are still used. 

Modem programming is slowly becoming a lost art, particularly with the widespread migration of users from dial-up lines to DSL for very obvious performance reasons. Nevertheless, modems are used for many applications. In recent times, modems can be found in new areas where they were previously not seen. For example, embedded modems in machines are used to automatically  &quot;call home&quot; to the manufacturer in case the machine is in need of some service. Often this is done via a wireless phone system, where the wireless module still provides a Hayes-compatible interface for dialing and data transmission.

The original Hayes modem command set is exclusively used as a reference in this module. '''Vendor specific extensions are not covered, and do not belong into this module'''. The module explains the origin of the term ''Hayes'', and the related ''AT commands''. It also includes some principal information about what a ''modem'' is, and how the signaling with a modem happens. The module then continues with a description of the basics of modem programming, including the set-up of a development environment.

Further, the module provides detailed (but ''incomplete'') programming information, and an ''incomplete'' reference of the original Hayes command set and registers.

=== Administrative Information ===

This section particularly addresses potential authors. Please note:

* This module '''is not''' a dumping ground for random modem programming information and folklore.
* This module is '''operating system agnostic'''. The [[Programming:Serial Data Communications|Programming Serial Data Communications]] book provides other modules for such information.
* This module deals with '''generic Hayes modems''', not with any vendor specific extensions. If you really want to see your particular love-child covered, provide an Appendix with that vendor/brand specific information. 
* Do not assume that just because something works on you particular modem it is the standard and other modems do it the same way. If you have no first hand experience that something is done the same way on &quot;almost&quot; all Hayes-compatible modems, then leave it out, or mark it at least as doubtful.

The reason why this module sticks with the original Hayes command set is to have a defined boundary. This module is not intended as a reference manual. Once someone has mastered the basic set, and implemented the code, it is rather straight forward to deal with vendor-specific extensions. Other extensions, e.g. the very rough and basic FAX extensions require some deep insight into the involved protocols (e.g. in the case of FAX the detailed encoding, compression and timing of fax data on the phone line). This is out of the scope of this book. If you know how to handle the FAX extensions, write your own book.

=== What is Hayes? ===

''Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc.'' was a modem manufacturer from the beginning of the 1980s until the end of the 1990s, with its heyday in the early '90s. The name ''Hayes'' still exists as a brand name, owned by ''Zoom Telephonics, Inc.'' (as of Fall 2004). 

In 1981, Hayes developed the '''Hayes Smartmodem'''.  This was a unique product at the time, because this modem was no longer simply a &quot;dumb&quot; device blindly converting serial data to and from audio tones, but contained some &quot;intelligence&quot;. It was possible to send commands to the modem to configure it, to execute certain operations (such as dialling a number, quieting the speaker, hanging up, etc.), and to read the current status of the connection. Hayes developed and published a command set to control the modem over a serial line. This command set became popular among consumer modem manufacturers, and was cloned a thousand times. Known as both the &quot;Hayes command set&quot; and the &quot;AT command set&quot;, it has long been the de-facto standard for controlling consumer modems and also many professional modems. Modems which support this command set are called ''Hayes-compatible''. 

The commands were standardised at some point in time, however, as it is typical with standards, there are several standards. Plus, of course, there are still vendor-specific extensions and implementations in different modems vary slightly. Some of these enhancements were required to support at that time emerging features, such as data compression and FAX support. As a result, the command sets of modern modems are not fully compatible with each other. The original Hayes commands, however, should still work, and still form the core of almost all consumer modem command sets.

The basic set of commands was at some point in time standardised as [http://www.tiaonline.org/standards/search_results2.cfm?document_no=TIA/EIA%2D602 TIA/EIA-602] and the syntax as EIA/TIA-615. But as already mentioned, modem manufacturers added their extensions. A larger extended set, particular under the pressure from cell phone manufacturers, was standardised as [http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&amp;lang=e&amp;parent=T-REC-V.250 ITU V.250] (old name V.25ter). That one usually forms the base for professional Hayes-compatible modems, and cell phones with build in data modems. ITU V.250 further referes to a bunch of other standards (e.g. V.251, V.252, V.253) for particular applications and extensions, and also has some supplements. Plus, of course there are the many standards defining other aspects of a modem, like compression and transmission.

* [[Transferring Data between Standard Dial-Up Modems]]

=== What are AT Commands? ===

Almost all of the Hayes modem commands start with the two letter sequence &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; - for getting the modem's ''attention''. Because of this, modem commands are often called ''AT Commands''. This still holds for many of the manufacturer specific command set extensions. Most of them also start with &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt;, and are called ''AT Commands'', too. Please note, that just because an AT command contains a ''&amp;'' does not make it an extensions. ''&amp;'' commands were already part of the original Hayes command set.

The exact usage of the term ''AT command set'' slightly varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, often subject to marketing blurbs. In general, it can be assumed that a modem with an ''AT command set''

* uses commands mostly starting with &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt;,
* uses the original Hayes way of separating data and commands, and
* supports the original Hayes commands and register settings as a subset.

=== What is a Modem? ===
{{wikipedia|Modem}}
A modem in the classic sense is a '''mo'''dulator/'''dem'''odulator for transmitting digital information over analog wires, such as the analog telephone system's two-wire or four-wire lines. The term has come to be used as acceptable slang for many communication devices used to link a computer to either another computer, or a wide-area network ([[Wikipedia:WAN]]).  For example, the Ricochet radio data transceivers were commonly known as &quot;Ricochet modems&quot;.

This module deals with the classic type of ''smart'' modems, designed to convert data from/to a serial interface to/from an analog line. The module also applies to modems which provide the classic serial interface but connect over a different physical layer, such as a digital line, as well as devices providing a serial modem-like interface for other purposes. For our purpose, the modem is a classic DCE (data communications equipment) device, controlled via serial line by a classic DTE (data terminal equipment) device (such as a computer).

Depending on the type of modem, the modem can use a number of different technologies and speeds to transmit the data over the analog line. The details of these technologies are of no particular interest here, other than to note that it is possible with most modems to specify these communication parameters (for example, to disable compression, or to change modulation techniques).  The data this module deals with is not the data on the analog line, but the data as it appears on the serial interface between the DTE and DCE. I.e. the data as read and written by a device like a computer.

(''Smart'') Modems also provide auxiliary services, such as dialling a particular number to set up a connection. As a consequence, a modem can be in a number of different states and modes, which are not always orthogonal. It is possible, for example, for a modem to be in the command mode while still keeping a connection (see the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; sequence for details).

Non-smart modems had to rely on other equipment like an ACU (automatic call unit) to provide these auxiliary services, but they are practically extinct today.

=== Inband Signalling ===

The original RS232C/V.24 specification contained a TX wire for transmitting data and a RX wire for receiving data, and other completely separate wires for transmitting control information between the DTE and DCE, the idea being to separate data and control information. In telecommunication jargon this is called &lt;b&gt;outband signalling&lt;/b&gt;.

Hayes-compatible modems use almost none of these RS232C/V.24 features. Instead, communication with the modem is done almost exclusively via the same RX/TX lines which are used for transferring the data. This mechanism is called &lt;b&gt;inband signalling&lt;/b&gt;.

Inband signalling has significant disadvantages. At any point in time, both the DTE and DCE must know if information sent or received via the TX and RX lines is for signalling purposes, or if it is data, which should be handled transparently.  Therefore, the DTE and DCE must operate in sync. If they get out of sync, either data will be lost, data will be incorrectly interpreted as commands, or signalling information will be interpreted as data, effectively destroying the original data.

Inband signalling has the advantage that the wiring between the DTE and DCE is simpler, and also that, at least at first glance, the communication software in the DTE is simpler.

As it has been said, Hayes-compatible modems use almost none of the RS232 control lines. But only almost. For example, they often drive DCD (data carrier detect). This, however creates the situation that modem-driving software now has to take care not only of the inband, but also the outband signalling with a modem. This slightly complicates the communication software's [[Serial_Programming/Modems_and_AT_Commands#Welcome_to_the_World_of_State-Machines|state machine]].

Further, especially with the rise of cell phone modems, manufacturers have again started to introduce more outband signaling. Such modems provide multiple virtual serial interfaces. Some of these interfaces are exclusively dedicated to data transport, controlled by another serial interface which is either used exclusively for signalling (i.e. outband signalling) or can still also be used in the more conventional inband signalling scenario. In such cases the communication software needs to manage even more complex states.

=== Command State / On-line State ===

With respect of controlling the modem a Hayes-compatible modem is one of two main states:

; Command State
: The modem interprets data from the DTE as modem commands. The modem can be in command state while still keeping a connection with a remote party.

; On-line State
: The modem interprets data from the DTE as payload and transmits it to the other party. This state requires that a connection to the remote site has been established.

Inside these main states are a number of sub states. Also, with respect to other issues a modem has a number of communication states, e.g. if a remote carrier has been detected or not.

=== Originating Mode / Answer Mode ===

; Originating mode
: A modem in originating mode is a modem which is setting up a connection, e.g., by dialing the number of a remote station and initiating the negotiation of protocols.

; Answer Mode
: A modem in answer mode is a modem waiting to be contacted and ready to &quot;answer the phone&quot;.

=== Command Responses ===

A modem is supposed to send a response for almost all commands it receives. These responses can either be in the form of ASCII strings, or numeric values. The response type can be switched with a command, but it is typical to use the ASCII responses.

Responses need to be tracked by the DTE with great care. Among other things they inform the DTE if the dialling of the remote site was successful or not, and if the modem switches from command state to on-line state or not.

Unfortunately, the set of response messages has been greatly enhanced since the original Hayes modems and are often configurable via additional &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; commands. It is suggested to not strictly parse response messages but to forgivingly check if they contain interesting keywords, like &lt;code&gt;CONNECT&lt;/code&gt;. It is also suggested to study the manual of a particular modem very carefully.

=== S-Registers ===

The so called S-registers are also a Hayes heritage which all Hayes-compatible modems support. They are registers in the modem which contain various settings. And like the AT commands, they have been extensively enhanced by different modem manufacturers.

The reason why they are called '''S'''-Registers is a little bit unclear. Some say the '''S''' stands for modem ''settings''. Some say they are just called like this, because      they are set and read with &lt;code&gt;ATS&lt;/code&gt;... commands.  In the common vernacular they were usually termed ''storage'' registers because they permanently stored the values even through power-off.

Several of the other &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; commands also change values of particular S-Registers. There is usually no difference in setting a value directly via an S-Register or via another &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; command. It depends on the particular situation which way of setting a register is better.

== Modem Programming Basics ==

=== Command Reference ===

In order to program for an actual modem it is a rather good idea to obtain the command reference for that particular modem. Unfortunately, it has become quite common for no-name modems to ship without any kind of usable command reference. Thanks to Windows' Plug &amp; Play feature it is no longer necessary on Windows to know the individual commands. Instead, all that is needed for a modem to run on Windows is to be shipped with the necessary &lt;code&gt;.inf&lt;/code&gt; files (often hidden inside some &quot;installer&quot; software, and called a &quot;driver&quot; which is technically not the case, Windows already contains the necessary drivers).

If the modem doesn't come with a command reference the next logical step is to search the web. However, unfortunately, a lot of modem information has vanished from the surface of the earth and the web in recent years. With the rise of broadband Internet connections, modems have become old fashioned devices and many sources are no longer available. It has become more and more difficult to find basic information about particular modem types. Even for modern modems like cell phone modems it can be difficult to find the necessary information.

There are a number of alternatives to obtain a command reference if one doesn't come with the modem:

* Maybe the distributor provides one on its website
* Maybe the OEM manufacturer provides one.&lt;br&gt;This requires to identify the OEM manufacturer. A possible way is to use the FCC number of the device, and then looking the original manufacturer up on the FCC web site.
* Maybe the chipset manufacturer provides one.&lt;br&gt;Consumer modems are often just build around &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; modem chipsets from larger hardware manufacturers. The cheaper the modem, the more likely it is that the modem manufacturer didn't change anything in the firmware and is using the original example software from the chipset manufacturer. Some chipset vendors provide command references for their modems.
* By looking into the corresponding Windows &lt;code&gt;.inf&lt;/code&gt; files it is possible to at least obtain the basic commands
* By using the generic Hayes command reference in this Wikibook module.
* Obtaining the previously mentioned standard documents if there is an indication a particular modem complies to such a command standard.
* Using some kind of ''sniffer'' program to monitor the communication between the modem and the DTE and reverse engineering the commands using the obtained information. This requires that (a) reverse engineering is legal in your jurisdiction and (b) that there is some DTE communication software available that handles the particular modem so there is some valid communication to sniff.

=== Setting up a Development Environment ===

It is highly recommended to spend some preparation time setting up a suitable development environment before starting to write drivers or software for a modem. Most of this consists of hardware set-up.

It is suggested to set up a small network with a &quot;remote&quot; computer and a second modem in answer mode. &quot;Remote&quot; computer in this case means a computer sitting right next to the development machine, but connected via the modems. If a &lt;b&gt;terminal program&lt;/b&gt; is being developed, the &quot;remote&quot; computer should run some small BBS software (for example), so there is always someone ready to answer, and/or protocol analysis/data dump software. Developing modem software without such a setup can be extremely frustrating. Such a set-up pays off a hundred times in reduced development time and lower stress.  Likewise, the modems used should have real speakers, and support &lt;code&gt;ATM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; commands well enough that you can leave the speaker on for the entire connection process (and ideally have the option to leave it on, period).  &quot;Debugging by ear&quot; can be a reality with modems, particularly during compatibility testing.

If possible, a hardware protocol analyser, or at least an [[Serial_Programming/RS-232_Connections#Breakout_Box|RS-232 breakout box]], should be obtained.  These can be placed between the computers and modems, if needed, to troubleshoot the serial link and ensure that data is, in fact, being transferred between the modem and the computer -- a sanity check which comes in handy far more often than you might expect.  Actual hardware protocol analysers are surprisingly expensive, however; old Wyse terminals are not, and are almost as useful for this purpose.  If you find one, pick it up.  Terminals that support automatic baud-rate detection are particularly useful.

If dialing with the modem also needs to be tested, a small analog PABX for home usage is needed.  These PABX units are dirt cheap; an analog PABX for four internal lines and one external line should cost no more than US$50. If dialing is not needed, then the modems should be capable of directly driving a two-wire or four-wire line in &lt;b&gt;leased-line&lt;/b&gt; mode; otherwise, the PABX is still needed.

Possible setups are for example:

a) Leased-Line Mode
 +-------------+  serial  +---------+  2-wire  +----------+  serial  +----------+
 | Development |----------| Modem A |----\/----| Modem B  |----------| BBS      |
 |  Computer   |----------|         |----/\----| (answer) |----------| Computer |
 +-------------+          +---------+          +----------+          +----------+

or

b) With PABX
 +-------------+  serial  +---------+  phone wire  +------+  phone wire  +----------+  serial  +----------+
 | Development |----------| Modem A |--------------| PABX |--------------| Modem B  |----------| BBS      |
 |  Computer   |----------|         |--------------|  X   |--------------| (answer) |----------| Computer |
 +-------------+          +---------+              +------+              +----------+          +----------+

or

c) Leased-Line Mode with Protocol Analyser

 +-------------+  serial  +---------+  serial  +---------+  2-wire  +----------+  serial  +----------+
 | Development |----------| Y Cable |----------| Modem A |----\/----| Modem B  |----------| BBS      |
 |  Computer   |----------| Breakout|----------|         |----/\----| (answer) |----------| Computer |
 +-------------+          +---------+          +---------+          +----------+          +----------+
                               ||
                               ||
                               ||
                          +----------+ 
                          | Protocol |
                          | Analyser |
                          +----------+

Other combinations are of course also useful. And being able to easily reconnect the protocol analyser, e.g. between Modem B and the BBS Computer is helpful, too.

=== Operating System, Programming Language &amp; Communication Basics ===

Before dealing with the details of handling a modem, a few basics should be in place. First of all, the communication with the serial interface should be in place. This includes that the APIs as provided by the particular operating system for serial communication - if any - should be understood. If the operating system doesn't provide such APIs, then it is recommended to first implement the UART access and wrap it into a library, if the serial UART in some hardware is supposed to be programmed directly. Alternatively, a programming language which provides convenient access to a serial interface can be used.

Whatever is used, it should be tested before starting to program for the modem. There is nothing more annoying than not knowing if a particular misbehaviour is caused by a failure in the serial communication with the modem, or is a problem with the modem (usually with the commands sent to it).

Unless in the most simple case, it is suggested to use hardware handshaking with the modem - particularly for speeds greater then 2400 bps or 9600 bps. Therefore, the used low-level serial communication software and hardware should support hardware handshake. If the UART supports some FIFO, like the 16550 UART, the FIFO should be enabled (both for sending and receiving data). 

It is undecided if data reception via polling or via interrupts is better. If every incoming byte raises an interrupt there are many interrupts at high communication speeds, and, as surprising as it might sound, polling the UART might be more efficient in such cases.

Communication as supported by a modem is usually half-duplex. Either the DTE or the DCE talks, the other side is supposed to listen. The communication with the modem should best be done with

* 8 Bit
* No parity
* 1 Stop bit

See the next section for speed information.

=== Line Speed is not DTE/DCE Speed ===
 +-------------+  DTE/DCE speed +---------+  line speed
 |    DTE /    |----------------| Modem / |--------------
 |  Computer   |----------------|  DCE    |--------------
 +-------------+                +---------+ 

{{Helpful hint|hint=Some modem manufacturers call the DTE/DCE speed ''DTE speed'', and the line speed ''DCE speed''. Others distinguish between ''DTE speed'' (DTE/DCE speed on the serial interface), ''DCE speed'' (bps between the modems), and ''line speed'' (Baud rate between the modems). Carefully observing the terminology can help to correctly interpret a manufacturer's documentation.}}
An issue which can be very confusing is the difference between the line speed (the data transfer speed on the telephone line) and the speed on the serial line between the DTE (computer) and the DCE (modem).

First, there is always some general confusion about the line speed, because some line speed is given with taking compression into account, while other data is given without taking compression into account. Also, there is a difference between ''bps'' and ''Baud'' due to the modulation schema used on the line. In addition, marketing blurbs obscure the picture. We will not make any attempt to clean up the long-standing Baud vs. bps confusion here (it is hopeless :-)). It is just recommended that whenever the modem returns information about line speed the above mentioned differences are taken into account to avoid any misinterpretation.

Second, the speed on the telephone line does not necessarily have to be the same as the speed on the serial line. In fact, it usually isn't on modern modems. It is recommended to set the DTE/DCE speed to a fixed speed instead of following the line speed. Logically, the fixed DTE/DCE speed should be large enough to cope with the highest expected line speed. V.90 modems should e.g. be accessed via 115200 bps or higher on the serial interface.

Setting the DTE/DCE speed on modern modems is quite simple. They all use autosensing on the serial interface. That is, they themselves detect the speed of data as received from the DTE and use the same speed to return data to the computer. They usually also autosense the parity, and 7 bit / 8 bit data length. Usually modems assume one stop bit when autosensing the serial interface. Therefore it is enought to just configure the serial interface on the DTE to the desired DTE/DCE communication parameters and let the modem figure it out on its own.

Autosensing can fail in rare cases and some modems might have broken autosensing. If a modem tends to fail autosensing it can help to start the initial communication after the DTE is configured with one or more ''nop'' AT commands
 AT''&lt;CR&gt;''
repeated a limited number of times until the modem starts to return
 OK
for the ''nop'' commands.

When a modem sets up a connection with a remote party it can report the used speed. In fact, it can report the line speed or just the DTE speed (some modems can report both). The end user is most probably interested in the line speed, and not the DTE/DCE speed. So from this point of view, it is best to set the modem to report the line speed, and e.g. write the received information to a log file.  However, some old communication software or modem drivers interpret the response from the modem as a request to change the DTE/DCE speed. In such cases the modem must be set to always return the DTE/DCE speed. Since this DTE/DCE speed will be the same as detected via autosensing there will be no speed change.

In the rare case that the DTE/DCE speed should indeed follow the line speed, the responses from the modem should of course be set to return the line speed. Then the DTE software has to evaluate the response, and change the DTE/DCE speed accordingly. This is really not recommended these days.

See the [[#W: Negotiation Progress Message Selection]] command for details on how to set which response to get.

=== Character Set and Character Case ===

Commands sent to the modem, and textual responses are supposed to be in the ISO 646 character set. ISO 646 is just another name for the  familiar 7-bit [[Wikipedia:ASCII|ASCII]] character set. Typically, modems chop off any 8th bit in commands they receive anyhow. They interpret the result as if the command has been sent using only 7-bit characters. However, it is not recommended to rely on this, but instead ensure that commands are only sent using 7-bit characters.

Commands are not case sensitive, assuming a modern modem. Some early modems insisted on uppercase-only commands. Still, a generic driver could do worse than ensuring that all commands are sent in uppercase, and all responses are interpreted case-independent. Typically, both letters of the &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; command prefix must be of the same case. So &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt; are acceptable, while &lt;code&gt;At&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;aT&lt;/code&gt; are not.

=== Welcome to the World of State-Machines ===

Modem programming means to tap into the world of telecommunications. This is an unknown field for most amateur, as well as professional programmers. Telecommunication is heavily centered around state-machines. And in fact, it is rather difficult or impossible to program a modem without using a state-machine. The modem is at any time in a particular state, and any DTE software which tries to control and use the modem needs to track the state of the modem - in its own state machine. This is necessary, because a Hayes-compatible modem can only do certain things when it is in a certain state. E.g. it can only dial out if it is not already connected to some remote site.

Part of a modem's state can be tracked via particular RS-232 lines. E.g. DCD (data carrier detect) can be used to figure out if the modem has detected a remote modem's carrier signal. Other information is provided by the flow-control lines. However, some states, and associated data need to be tracked via interpreting the modem's [[#Result Codes|result codes]].

People unfamiliar with the theory and practice of state machines often try to circumvent the issue by &quot;tough coding&quot;. Which means, they throw more and more code onto the problem (wrapped in a heap of if/the/else/otherwise/maybe/... statements), until things seem to work - sort of. If they are lucky they have implicitly managed to create a state machine which works. If they are unlucky, they end up with a partial state machine, which breaks down should something unusual happen in the communication. This usually comes with the problem that the software was not designed to recover if things break down. So such software tends to hang or crash.

It is much more efficient to first spend a few hours to to learn the basics of simple state machines, and then spending a few more hours to describe the communication with the modem as a state machine. The result of this planning serves as a nice template for implementing the DTE software.

{{TODO|Provide a complete state machine, describing all the usual modem and communication states, and the possible transitions}}

== Flow Control ==
A slow device needs a way to tell its peer that currently, it is busy, so further incoming data must be stopped until this slow device tells otherwise. This mechanism is provided by flow control.
There are two ways of doing flow control: by hardware or software.
=== Hardware Flow Control ===
Hardware flow control is usually implemented using the CTS ([[Serial_Programming/RS-232_Connections#CTS_.28Clear_To_Send.29|Clear To Send]]) and RTS ([[Serial_Programming/RS-232_Connections#RTS_.28Request_To_Send.29|Request To Send]]) lines, which needs separate hardware data lines between devices. This is allocated in the RS-232 cable specification.

Hardware flow control based on DSR ([[Serial_Programming/RS-232_Connections#DSR_.28Data_Set_Ready.29|Data Set Ready]]) and DTR ([[Serial_Programming/RS-232_Connections#DTR_.28Data_Terminal_Ready.29|Data Terminal Ready]]) is uncommon, particular for modems. It can usually be found at serial printers. Again, DSR/DTR hardware flow control requires additional hardware data lines between devices.

From a programming point of view there is usually not much difference in programming CTS/RTS or DSR/DTR hardware flow control. The hardware has to provide means to drive/read the corresponding signals in the serial interface. If the hardware supports both, CTS/RTS and DSR/DTR flow control, then it is recommended to support both and provide the user with a configuration option.

It should be noted that some hardware or operating system drivers do not provide means to drive/read the less common DSR/DTR combination. If the remote device insists on DTR/DSR flow control a common workaround is to use CTS/RTS in the software, but rewire the cabling so the CTS/RTS wires are in fact connected to DSR/CTS.

=== Software Flow Control ===
This kind of flow control doesn't need extra signal line(s) like hardware flow control, but instead uses special control characters within the data content.  To stop further incoming data, the receiving device sends the XOFF character.  To enable more data, an XON character will be sent.

However, since the data being sent cannot contain these characters (unless you know that the receiving device ignores such information), binary (non-ASCII) data cannot be transmitted this way.  Software flow control is typically used for communications to terminals and other character-based devices.  Binary data should not be sent this way as it could, randomly, contain these characters.  Hardware flow control using RTS/CTS is usually used.

Helpful Hint: Realizing that the Control Key is a special &quot;shift&quot; key that chops off the 100 bit (octal), it is easy to remember that the ASCII character used for sending XOFF is a Control-S (23 Octal) while the character for XON is a Control-Q (21 Octal).  [Think of &quot;S&quot; for Stop and &quot;Q&quot; for Qontinue... don't you spell it that way?]

== Changing State ==

=== General ===

Changing the state from command state to on-line state or vice versa is either straightforward or a great mystery. This module covers the more obscure ways.

=== On-line State to Command State ===

It is of course possible to switch from on-line state to command state by dropping the connection (going on-hook in modem terminology). It is also possible to temporarily switch into command state while keeping the connection.

Going on-hook programmatically (and not via dropping a modem control line) requires to first switch into command state while keeping the connection, too. 

Switching into command state, while in fact in the middle of transferring data (nothing else is meant with on-line state) requires to send a certain escape sequence as part of the data. This escape sequence is detected by the modem and the modem changes state. Since this character sequence might also be part of the normal data, an additional mechanism is needed to separate the escape sequence from normal data. This is the curse of inband signalling.

The separation of the escape sequence is done by using a so called guard time, which was once patented by Hayes. As a result, some modem manufacturers eliminated the guard time using an alternate escape sequence called the Time Independent Escape Sequence. Anyway, the escape sequence is only recognized by the modem when there was no other data from the DTE (terminal) for at least the duration of the guard time, and when there was no other data from the terminal after the escape sequence for at least the duration of the guard time, too.

An escape sequence consists of three times the same particular character. The character, as well as the guard time is configurable. By default, the character is &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, and the guard time is one second. So, with the default configuration, a change to command state requires

 ''&lt;1 sec. nothing&gt;''+++''&lt;1 sec. nothing&gt;''

If the connection should be dropped, this escape sequence should be followed by the &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; command to go on-hook, which is &lt;code&gt;ATH0&lt;/code&gt;:

 ''&lt;1 sec. nothing&gt;''+++''&lt;1 sec. nothing&gt;''ATH0''&lt;CR&gt;''

=== Command State to On-line State ===

The usual way to go from command state to on-line state is via dialing the remote site (see &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; command). But if the connection already exists, and the modem has been switched to command mode via the escape sequence, the way is different.

If the connection should not be dropped, but instead data transmission should be continued, the &lt;code&gt;ATO0&lt;/code&gt; (letter o, digit zero) command is needed:

 ''&lt;1 sec. nothing&gt;''+++''&lt;1 sec. nothing&gt;''
 ''send a few more modem commands, then go back on-line''
 ATO0''&lt;CR&gt;''

==  AT Commands ==

The following list is the list of the original Hayes commands. Different modems use slightly different commands. However, this list is supposed to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, and should not be extended with modem specific commands. Instead it is recommended to provide such command lists in an Appendix.

=== AT Command Format ===

Here is a summary of the format and syntax of AT commands. Please note that most of the control characters are configurable, and the summary only uses the default control characters.

* AT commands are accepted by the modem only when in command mode. The modem can be forced into command mode with the [[#+++: Escape Sequence]].

* Commands are grouped in command lines.

* Each command line must start with the [[#AT: Command Prefix]] and terminated with [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]]. The only exception is the [[#A/: Repeat Last Command]] command.

* The body of a command line consists of visible ASCII characters (ASCII code 32 to 126). Space (ASCII code 32) and ASCII control characters (ASCII code 0 to 31) are ignored, with the exception of [[#&lt;BS&gt;: Backspace Character]], [[#&lt;CAN&gt;: Cancel Character]], and [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]].

* All characters preceding the [[#AT: Command Prefix]] are ignored.

* Interpretation / execution of the command line starts with the reception of the first (and also command-line terminating) [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]].

* Characters after the initial [[#AT: Command Prefix]] and before the [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]] are interpreted as commands. With some exceptions, there can be many commands in one command line.

* Each of the basic commands consists of a single ASCII letter, or a single ASCII letter with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;prefix, followed by a numeric value.  Missing numeric values are interpreted as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (zero).

* The following commands can't be followed by more commands on the command line. They must always be the last commands in a command line. If they are followed by other commands, these other commands are ignored. However, some of these commands take command modifiers and it is possible that a following command is accidentally interpreted as a command modifier. Therefore, care should be taken to not follow these commands with any more commands on the same command line. Instead, they should be placed in an own command line.
** [[#A: Answer Command]]
** [[#D: Dial Command]]
** [[#Z: Soft Reset Command]]

* A command line can be edited if the terminating [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]] has not ben entered, using the [[#&lt;BS&gt;: Backspace Character]] to delete one command line character at a time. The initial [[#AT: Command Prefix]] can't be edited/deleted (it has already been processed, because upon reception of the [[#AT: Command Prefix]] the modem immediately starts command line parsing and editing, but not execution).

* The modem echoes command lines and edits when [[#E: Command State Character Echo Selection]] is on (surprise, surprise :-)).

* When echo is on, [[#&lt;BS&gt;: Backspace Character]]s are echoed with a sequence of &lt;code&gt;&lt;BS&gt; &lt;BS&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (backspace, space, backspace) to erase the last character in e.g. a terminal program on the DTE.

* A command line can be cancelled at any time before the terminating [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]] by sending the [[#&lt;CAN&gt;: Cancel Character]]. No command in the command line is executed in this case.

* The [[#A: Answer Command]] and [[#D: Dial Command]] can also be cancelled as long as the handshake with the remote site has not been completed. Cancellation is done by sending an additional character. In theory, it doesn't matter which character. But care has to be taken that cancellation is not attempted when the handshake has already completed. In this case the modem has switched to on-line state ([[#Command State to On-line State]]) and the character will be send to the remote side. A save way to avoid this problem is to always use the [[#+++: Escape Sequence]] followed by going on-hock with the [[#H: Hook Command Options]]. If the modem is already in the on-line state, this will drop the connection. If the modem is still in the handshake phase the first character of the [[#+++: Escape Sequence]] will cancel the command (and the rest will be interpreted as a normal command line, doing no harm).

* Command line execution stops when the first command in the command line fails, or the whole command line has been executed. Every command before the failed command has been executed. Every command after the failed command and the failed command in the command line has not been executed.

* There is no particular indication which command in a command line failed, only that one failed. It is best to repeat the complete command line, or to first reset the modem to a defined state before recovering from a failure.

* A modem only accepts a new command line when the previous command line has been executed (half-duplex communication). Therefore, care should be taken to only send the next command line after the result code from the previous command line has been received.

[[File:Europe religions 1560.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Spread of Protestantism During the 1500s]]
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny. For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs. Its all-pervading power affected everyone from king to commoner. One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for that reason. The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this tenet was being met. In many respects, the northern European countries felt as though the Papal power was now a Papal business. However it must be noted that the Catholic church has always been the dominant institution in southern European countries and in that respect the Reformation can be described as the rise of a uniquely northern European form of Christianity. Whether its aim was to return the church to Christ's message or simply a politically motivated and regional response to the concentration of Papal wealth and power is still a question that divides people.

== Causes of the Protestant Reformation ==

=== Accusations Of Corruption ===
The purchase of church offices (benefices) and the holding of multiple offices (pluralism) had become common during this period. As was the selling of indulgences, or forgiveness from God. To some Christians this was proof that the church had become corrupt. Popes and bishops were accused of being preoccupied with acquiring wealth rather than tending to ecclesiastical matters. The legal exemptions from taxes and criminal charges that they enjoyed led many to believe that they could exploit their position for their own benefit. Clergy were accused of ignoring the church's message on priestly celibacy and poverty therefore weakening the church's moral authority. These accusations eventually turned into a &quot;protest&quot; against Papal power and clerical abuses.

=== Reactions to Church Corruption ===
These allegations of abuse of authority led some to call for a change. Some clergy and monarchs resented the tithes (a proportion of the sum collected by the church) that they paid to the central Catholic Church in Italy. The Catholic Church had become a major landowner all over Europe and this ownership of extensive areas of land by religious orders, churches, monasteries and cathedrals had not gone unnoticed. With land comes political power, and for any king or lord whose own clergy deferred to a foreign authority the issue was now political rather than religious. The issue also arose about the use of the Latin Bible. It was standard practice for masses to be conducted in Latin though by this period Latin had achieved the archaic nature of a dead language. Though Latin was still the language of scholarly publications, its use in the mass was questioned on evangelist grounds. Christ's message would be better served using the language of the congregation. The invention of the printing press, the decline in Latin and the need to allow the congregation to hear mass in the vernacular led to a break with Christian tradition. John Wycliff initiated the first English translation of the Bible and this is cited by many as the precursor to the Protestant Reformation.

== Key Persons of the Reformation ==
From 1521 to 1555, Protestantism spread across Europe. The Reformation started as a religious movement, but became political, and as a result had economic and social impacts.

[[File:Martin_Luther,_1529.jpg|thumb|200px|Luther at age 46 (Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1529)]]
=== Martin Luther (1486-1546) ===
Although there were some minor individual outbreaks such as that of [[w:John_Wycliffe|John Wycliffe]], a young German monk, called [[w:Martin_Luther|Martin Luther]] was the first to force the issue of the immorality of Church corruption. Disillusioned with the Church, Luther questioned the idea of [[w:Good_works|''good works'']] for salvation, including prayers, fasting, and particularly [[w:Indulgences|indulgences]].

==== ''95 Theses'' ====
In 1517, Luther posted his [[w:95_theses|''95 Theses'']], though it is debated whether these were nailed to Wittenburg's [[w:Castle_Church|All Saint's Church]], known as ''Schlosskirche'', meaning Castle Church, or his church door. These theses attacked the ideas of salvation through works, the sale of indulgences, and the collection of wealth by the [[w:Papacy|papacy]]. He formally requested a public debate to settle the issue.

==== Excommunication ====
[[w:Leo_X|Pope Leo X]] demanded that Luther stop preaching, which Luther refused. He was excommunicated because he did not recant his statements and allegations about indulgences and immoral salvation. He said only scripture can show what the pope has done is ok. [[w:Excommunicated|excommunicated]] in 1520; he burned the announcement in front of a cheering crowd.

==== Diet of Worms ====
Luther was demanded by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles to appear before the [[w:Diet_of_worms|Diet of Worms]] in 1521; Luther did not back down from his stance, and was declared a [[w:heresy|heretic]]. The Edicts of Worms declared Luther an outlaw and heretic, giving anyone permission to kill Luther without recourse. Due to Luther's popularity in Germany, this could not be enforced.

==== Lutheranism ====
[[w:Lutheranism|Lutheranism]] stresses education for all, including females. According to Lutheran doctrine, marriage is important, and gender roles should be enforced: women belong in the home and should control the economy, while men should control the household. Clergy can marry.

[[w:salvation|Salvation]] is attained by [[w:faith|faith]] alone, instead of through works. Religious authority is found in the Bible instead of from the Pope; each man can be his own priest. Religious services are held in vernacular instead of Latin. Only two sacraments are followed: Baptism, and the Lord's Supper. Lutheranism teaches neither &quot;transubstantiation&quot; (the Roman Catholic view that the wine and bread change into the body and blood of Christ) nor &quot;consubstantiation&quot; (the view that the body and blood mingle with the bread and wine to become a third substance), but instead teaches that the Lord's Supper is the true body and blood of Jesus Christ, &quot;in, with and under the bread and wine,&quot; given to believers to eat and drink. The benefits of receiving the sacrament come not from the physical eating and drinking, but from Jesus' spoken promise and assurance. In this sense, the sacrament is a proclamation of the Gospel. It is God's Word that makes the Lord's Supper a sacrament, and Luther taught that this means of grace is to be received in faith.

===== Justification by Faith =====
Chief among Luther's doctrines is Justification by Faith. In it, he attacks the Church's view that good works can get a Christian into heaven. For Luther, because humans are inherently flawed, they can only rely on God's grace to get to heaven, not their own works. Therefore only faith in the grace of God was necessary (and sufficient) to obtain entry to heaven. 

===== The Bible as Supreme Authority =====
Luther said, &quot;... when the Word accompanies the water, Baptism is valid, even though faith be lacking.&quot;

Luther challenged the role of the Pope as the supreme temporal authority for interpreting God's will. For Luther, the Bible was the supreme authority of God. As an extension of this philosophy, Luther believed that all Christians should be able to interpret the Scripture (in effect, acting as their own priest). This led Luther to place a heavy emphasis on universal literacy among Christians so that they could read the Bible and attain salvation (a doctrinal point which, along with the advent of the printing press barely more than half a century earlier, led to profound implications for Western society). It also led to Luther's translation of the Bible into German, which he did while in hiding from the wrath of the Holy Roman Emperor. This edition of the Bible became massively popular and made Luther's dialect of German the standard to this day. It also had the intended effect of moving Protestant liturgy into the vernacular.

===== The Sacraments =====
The Catholic Church at the time of Luther had seven sacraments (with little change today):

* Baptism -- The dousing of infants with water to induct them into the church. 
* The Eucharist (Holy Communion) -- Taking bread and wine in remembrance of the Last Supper.
* Matrimony -- Marriage.
* Holy Orders -- Becoming a priest.
* Penance -- Making contrition for your sins.
* Confirmation -- a kind of coming-of-age rite in which young people are indoctrinated to the church's teachings.
* Last Rites of Extreme Unction (Last Rites) -- At that time an anointing with oil to heal the sick, now more commonly a death rite.

Luther considered all but two of those to be unnecessary, and out of the two he accepted (Baptism and Holy Communion) he considered only baptism to be doctrinally sound. The present Roman Catholic view of the Holy Communion (transubstantiation) developed in the scholastic period. According to this understanding of the Eucharist, Roman Catholic priests were primarily responsible for the bread and wine of the Eucharist becoming the body and blood of Christ. Luther did not believe that the bread and wine changed into the flesh and blood of Christ, but rather that the flesh and blood of Christ was invisibly present &quot;in, with, and under&quot; the bread and wine in the ritual. This &quot;Real Presence&quot; is caused by God and not by a priest thus undercutting the Catholic authority over the sacrament.

=== Ulrich Zwingli (1484-1531), Zwinglianism ===
Zwinglianism originated in Switzerland, introduced by Ulrich Zwingli. Zwinglism believed in the two sacraments of baptism and communion. The religion advocated most of the key Protestant beliefs. It believed that the Church is the ultimate authority, and it rejected rituals such as fasting and the elaborate ceremonies of Catholicism. Finally, it advocated reform through education.

=== John Calvin (1504-1564), Calvinism ===
John Calvin founded Calvinism in Geneva, Switzerland; Calvinism later spread to Germany. Calvin was the leading reformer of the second generation of the Reformation, succeeding Martin Luther at the forefront of theological debate and discussion. His most important work was &lt;u&gt;Institutes of the Christian Religion&lt;/u&gt;, published in 1541 at the age of 26. At the time, it had a tremendous impact, and many considered Calvin to be a Protestant equivalent of Thomas Aquinas. In it, Calvin outlined the central premises of the religious doctrine which was to bear his name.

==== Predestination ====
Foremost among these is Calvin's assertion of Double Predestination (often simply referred to as predestination). Single predestination was the doctrine held by most orthodox theologians, including Luther. It said, in essence, that the elect were predestined for heaven. However, they pointed out that those who went to hell went there on their own free will. Calvin objected to this, saying that because all mankind was born in sin, and God had chosen a specific few to go to Heaven through His grace, he must have also chosen an elect who are doomed to damnation. This assertion is based on the commonly accepted view of God as: Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, and All-Loving. From these premises, Calvin concluded that not only is there an elect destined for Heaven, but also an elect destined for Hell, and that no one could know with certainty their destination.

==== The Sacraments ====
Like Martin Luther, Calvin believed that there were only two sacraments in the church: the Eucharist (Holy Communion) and Baptism. 
With regard to the Eucharist (Holy Communion), Calvin tried to eke out a middle path between the positions which had led to the schism of the Marburg Colloquy. While Luther insisted that the body and blood of Christ were made materially present in the bread and wine of the communion, and Zwingli insisted that the communion was merely a symbol of communion, Calvin said that participating in The Eucharist raised the heart and mind of the believer to feast with Christ in heaven. Calvin's view never took root within the Reformation and it was eventually overshadowed by Luther's and Zwingli's views.

=== Huguenots ===
French Calvinists that were persecuted because of their religion. The Edict of Nantes gave them the freedom of worship, however during the reign of Louis XIV, the Edict of Fountainbleu was passed. The Edict of Fountainbleu revoked the rights given to the Huguenots.

== The Counter-Reformation ==
The Catholics, enraged at the rise of Protestantism and determined to restore their control over European society, began their reform movement, which gained momentum in Italy during the 1530s and 1540s. The Catholic Church worked to reform, reaffirm their key beliefs, and then defend their ideology. It is important to recognize that they changed nothing about their core beliefs.

=== Council of Trent (1545-1563) ===
Pope Paul III and Charles V Hapsburg of Austria convened a general church council at Trent that met sporadically between 1545 and 1563. The Council reasserted the supremacy of clerics over the laity. It did, however, establish seminaries in each diocese to train priests. They reformed indulgences, though the process was continued. They did, however, eliminate pluralism, nepotism, simony, and other similar problems from the church. They reaffirmed their belief of [[w:Transubstantiation|transubstantiation]] that during the Eucharist, the bread and wine literally become Christ's body. The Council showed that the schism between Protestants and Catholics had become so severe that all hopes of reconciliation were gone.

=== Catholic Attempts to Re-convert Protestants and Extend the Faith ===
The Catholic Church used Baroque art to show dramatic biblical scenes and large canvasses. This art was primarily spectator-oriented and was used to make religion more enjoyable to the lay person. In Spain and Rome, Inquisitions, or institutions within the Roman Catholic Church charged with the eradication of heresy, were used to root out heretics. In addition, the Church established the Index of Prohibited Books, which banned books they considered heretical. Finally, the Church sent missionaries around the globe to spread its beliefs and faith.

=== Jesuits ===
The Society of Jesus, or Jesuits as it was known (founded on August 15, 1534 in France), was a new religious order that arose as a result of the Counter-Reformation. It was founded by former Spanish soldier and priest, St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), to convert Protestants and non-Christians to Catholicism and add lands to Christendom. The Jesuits vigorously defended the papal authority and the authority of the Catholic Church, thus their title as the &quot;footmen of the Pope&quot;.

=== Missionaries ===
Missionaries visited other distant nations to spread the ideals of Catholicism.

=== Major Figures ===
The three most Catholic nations in Europe at the time were the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and France. Important leaders of the Counter-Reformation included:

* Paul III, the pope that called together the Council of Trent
* Charles V Hapsburg, leader of Austria and the most vigorous defender of the Catholic Church at the time in Europe
* Philip II Hapsburg, leader of Spain and Catholic son of Charles V; he married Mary Tudor of England
* &quot;Bloody&quot; Mary Tudor, Catholic daughter of Henry VIII Tudor, she married Philip II
* Catherine de Medici of Florence, regent of France
* Ferdinand II

Prominent Protestant opponents of the Counter-Reformation included:

* Elizabeth Tudor, the leader of England and half-sister of Mary Tudor
* William of Orange, the leader of the Netherlands
* Protestant Princes in the Holy Roman Empire and France
* Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden

== The Spanish Reconquista of 1492 ==
As a response to the reformation and in an attempt to preserve Catholicism in Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella forcibly expelled Jews and Muslims. Jews who either voluntarily or forced became Christians became known as ''conversos''. Some of them were crypto-Jews who kept practicing Judaism. Eventually all Jews were forced to leave Spain in 1492 by Ferdinand and Isabella. Their ''converso'' descendants became victims of the Spanish Inquisition.

== Religious Qualms in England ==
In 1547, 10 year old Edward VI, son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, took the throne. He was cold, serious, and cruel, and although he was incredibly intelligent and exceptionally capable for his age, he was represented by a regent who controlled the nation. From 1547 until 1549, the regent was Edward Seymour. From 1549 to 1553, the regent was John Dudley. Before Edward's death in 1553, he signed a will leaving the throne to Lady Jane Grey out of fear that his sister Mary would convert England back to Catholicism.

Lady Jane Grey ruled for nine days, but she and Dudley were soon arrested because Mary Tudor began to gain support since she was the rightful heir to the throne upon Edward's death.

&quot;Bloody&quot; Mary Tudor thus took the throne in 1553 and ruled until 1558. She was proud, stubborn, vain, vulnerable to flattery, but most of all, she was highly Catholic. In 1554, she converted England back to Catholicism and burnt hundreds of Protestants at the stake, thus earning her nickname &quot;Bloody&quot; Mary. She married Philip II of Spain. However, as a result of her illness from ovarian cancer, she was forced to recognize her Protestant sister Elizabeth as the heir.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
During the period of 1525 until 1648, Europe was plagued by wars of religion. It is important to recognize, however, that while religion was given as the reason for war, there were many other reasons as well. These included land, money and economics, political power, natural resources, ghost experiences, constipation, and more.

These wars included the Peasants' War of 1525 in the Holy Roman Empire, the Schmalkaldic War of the 1540s through 1555, an ongoing fight between the Holy Roman Empire and the Turks, the Reconquista of the Spanish versus Muslims, the Hussite rebellion, and missionaries and conquistadors versus Native Americans.

===Warfare===

Religious fighting and warfare spread with Protestantism.  The radical new doctrine in Germany brought other simmering social tensions to a boil; peasant revolts flared in 1525, resulting in chaos and bloodshed across Austria, Switzerland and southern Germany.  Wealthy landowners were the target of downtrodden rebels demanding social equality and sharing of wealth in common.  Armies loyal to ruling princes suppressed the revolt, and the leaders were executed.  Martin Luther, chief initiator of the Reformation, turned against the rebels and defended the authorities' moves to put them down.

===Peace of Augsburg===
[[image:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Henry IV Bourbon of France by [[w:Frans Pourbus the younger|Frans Pourbus the younger]].]]
The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 declared the Prince's religion to be the official religion of a region or country (''cuius regio, eius religio'').  This resulted in the acceptance of toleration of Lutheranism in Germany by Catholics.  When a new ruler of a different religion took power, large groups had to convert religions.  Most people found this to be realistic, and the process did not end until 1648.

In northern Europe (north Germany, Netherlands, and France), the middle class tended to be Protestant, which corresponded with their work ethic and philosophy.  Peasants readily converted religions in order to obtain jobs.

===Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis===

With the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559, Spain and France agreed to stop fighting with each other in order to unite against their common Protestant threat, particularly Calvinism, which was considered more of a threat than Lutheranism.

===French War of Religion===

In France, religious civil war took place from 1562 to 1598 between Catholics and Protestants. The crown usually supported the Catholics but occasionally shifted sides, while the nobility was divided among the two camps.  The three leading families in the nation competed for control of France.  These families were the Valois family, which was currently in power and was Catholic, the Bourbon family, which consisted of Huguenots (French Protestants), and the Guise family, who was also Catholic.  Ultimately, the Bourbon family won the war, but its leader Henry of Navarre was unable to be crowned because the strongly Catholic city of Paris shut itself down.  Henry put Paris under a year of siege before finally deciding to convert to Catholicism himself in 1593. The civil war in France was ended by the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which reaffirmed that Catholicism was the official religion in France, but also granted a significant degree of religious and political freedom to Protestants.

Henry IV could be described as a ''politique'', or one who cares more about his nation's peace and prosperity than he does the enforcement of religious toleration.

==Spanish Conflict with the Dutch==

In 1566, on the Assumption of the Virgin day, a group of Calvinists in the Netherlands stormed Catholic churches, destroying statutes and relics in a town just outside of Antwerp.  Dutch Calvinists resented the Catholic religion and their conflicts with the religion, as well as Spanish King Philip II's deep devoutness and close-mindedness toward other religions.
The high nobility pleaded with him for more tolerance but some of them were put to death for their insolence. One of the underlying reasons was that Philip wanted to establish an absolute monarchy in the Netherlands and the religious issue gave him a way to put pressure on the parliament. William of Orange escaped to Germany from where he tried to incite a rebellion from 1568 onwards but with little success at first. In 1570 the coastal regions got hit by a weather-related disaster, the All Saints flood that left many regions devastated and the Spanish authorities showed little compassion. William of Orange, then encouraged Sea Beggars, or pirates, to invade the ports of the coast. In 1572 the small town of Brielle was taken by what were no more than outlaws, greeted enthusiastically by the population. The town declared itself for the prince of Orange and this example was followed by a number of other towns in the relatively inaccessible provinces of Holland and Zeeland.
[[Image:WilliamOfOrange1580.jpg|thumb|200px|William of Orange, or William the Silent.]]
Philip sent Spanish troops in response. They took Naarden and Haarlem and inflicted horrible suffering on the population. Other towns proved far harder to take and this caused Philip to run out of money. In what became known as the Spanish Fury, in November of 1576, Philip's unpaid mercenary armies attacked the city of Antwerp killing 7,000 in 11 days. Antwerp was by far the richest city at the time and the influential merchants got the parliament to convene and raise money  to pay off the marauding mercenaries. By doing so the parliament basically took over control from the king in far Madrid and this was the last thing the king wanted. He sent more troops with an ultimatum to the parliament to surrender or else and appointed the Duke of Parma as the new governor of the Netherlands.  In 1579, the southern ten provinces of the Netherlands, which were Catholic, signed the Union of Arras, expressing loyalty to Philip.  During that same year, William of Orange united seven northern states in the Union of Utrecht, which formed the Dutch Republic that openly opposed Philip and Spain.  In 1581, the Spanish army was sent to retake the United Provinces of the Netherlands, or the Dutch Republic, who had just declared their independence.

On July 10, 1584, William of Orange was assassinated, and after his death, the Duke of Parma made progress in his reconquest, capturing significant portions of the Dutch Republic.  However, England, under the leadership of Elizabeth I, assisted the Dutch with troops and horses, and as a result Spain was never able to regain control of the north.  Spain finally recognized Dutch independence in 1648.

==The Spanish Armada==

[[File:Spanish Armada.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Defeat of the Spanish Armada.]]

Catholic Philip II of Spain desired to remove Elizabeth I of England from the throne after her rise to power following &quot;Bloody&quot; Mary Tudor's fall to illness.  Philip was primarily angry over Elizabeth's actions against English Catholics, but he was also upset as a result of attacks by English privateers upon Spanish vessels, Elizabeth's assisting enemies of Spain such as the Netherlands, and the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.

Philip devised a plan to invade England.  The four components of this plan were to bring  a large army into the Netherlands under the lead of the Duke of Parma and get them prepared to invade England.  In addition, the Duke of Medina-Sardonia would prepare a large fleet with extra men, and equip the men to join up with the Duke of Parma's army.  Then, Spain would use its fleet to win control of the English Channel and protect the Duke of Parma's invading force as it crossed.  Finally, the troops would invade England and force Elizabeth to agree to Spain's demands: to allow English Catholics to worship in the way that they wanted, to stop assisting Protestant Dutch rebels in the Spanish Netherlands, and to pay reparations for the cost of the invasion as well as English damage to Spanish ships.  Philip did not, however, have any intent to conquer England - he simply desired Elizabeth to cede to Spain's demands. Although on 29 July 1587, Pope Sixtus V had granted Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been declared a heretic by Pope Pius V, and place whomever he chose on the throne of England.

===Initial Problems with the Plan===

There were a number of problems with Philip's plan.  First, the Duke of Medina-Sardonia was appointed leader of the operation.  He had no naval experience and was fatalistic.  Moreover, the Duke of Parma refused to cooperate, as he wanted to be the commander.  As a result, he did not assemble enough vessels.  In addition, during the preparations, Sir Francis Drake of England raided the city of Cadiz and sank 30 Spanish vessels and burnt barrel staves, resulting in the food for the armada becoming spoiled.  Finally, the invasion consisted of 131 ships, resulting in difficult communications.

===The Attack===

The Armada arrived in late July of 1588, and was spotted immediately by English lookouts.  At this time, the Duke of Parma still needed a few more days to prepare the troops.  On July 20, Admiral Howard of England devised a plan using fireships, or ships filled with combustibles, to attack the Spanish fleet.  These attacks resulted in the Spanish fleet cutting its anchors.  On July 29, the major confrontation took place, called the Battle of Gravelines.  The Spanish tactics were outdated - they were to sail in close, fire one volley at the English ships, and then proceed to board the English vessels.  However, the English navy had devised new tactics, using smaller, more maneuverable ships with longer range, movable cannons. But this new tactic was not decisive, because little damage was done to ships in formation. On the other hand all attempts to leave the formation led to immediate destruction by combined fire of the English ships. When the English fleet was able to scatter the Spanish formation with burners, the Armada decided to retreat. This, coupled with the so-called &quot;Protestant Wind&quot; that blew the Spanish ships through the English Channel, resulted in the Spanish defeat.
On May 28, 1588, the Armada had set sail with 131 ships and 30,000 men. 67 ships and around 10,000 men returned. Many ships sank along the Irish coast, about 5000 men died from starvation and others were executed in Ireland by English authorities.

===Results of the Spanish Armada===

The Spanish fleet was able to recover from this defeat in numbers, but morale was shattered. The events marked the rise of English naval power.  In addition, they resulted in Dutch independence since Spain could not defeat England.  The events were thus a blow to the Counter-Reformation, leading to an overall decline in the Counter-Reformation's effects.

==The Decline of Spain==

It is a common misconception that the failure of the armada resulted in the decline of Spain.

After the failed invasion of England, Spain soon began to enter a period of decline.  This occurred for a number of reasons.  The Counter-Reformation had drained considerable Spanish resources.   Moreover, many of the resources of the Spanish colonies had been exhausted.  Additionally, only one-third of Spain's population actually worked - one-third of the population belonged to the clergy and another one-third belonged to lower nobility - and there was no middle class in Spain, and a small higher class.  Finally, inbreeding caused inept leadership in the monarchy.

==The Thirty Years' War==

[[Image:Thirtywar.gif|thumb|300px|The victory of [[w:Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] at the [[w:Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)]].]]

The Thirty Years' War was sparked by the [[w:Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]], at which Protestants threw Catholic ambassadors out of a window in the city of Prague.

The Thirty Years' War had started as a war along religious frontlines. In the end it was no more a war of religion.  The Catholic French funded and traded the Protestant Dutch, Protestant Princes in the Holy Roman Empire, as well as other non-Catholic nations such as Sweden, Denmark, and Turkey, since all of these nations were fighting the Hapsburgs.  France, led by Cardinal Richelieu, regent for Louis XIII, desired to reduce the power of Austria by funding Austria's enemies.  The war was essentially a fight between the two powers to determine which would become the main power in Europe.

Although a high member of the Catholic Church, Richelieu can be described as a ''politique'', as he put his nation's interests ahead of his religion.  Indeed, Richelieu openly funded Protestant groups in his fight against Austria.

===Precursors to the War===

The Schmalkaldic Wars and the Peace of Augsburg of the 1540s through 1555 created a number of issues for Charles V Hapsburg of Austria.  The debate over what religion German states could adopt had not been resolved, as the Peace of Augsburg provided for the states' princes to adopt either Catholicism or Lutheranism, but not Calvinism.  The issue of the German princes' power and sovereignty was also at bay, as the princes increasingly desired more power.  Finally, the princes had been seizing Church land, angering Charles V.

===Bohemian Phase (1618-1625)===

Protestant Bohemians rebelled for religious freedom and independence from Hapsburg rule.  The Defenestration of Prague, in which rebels threw two of the Holy Roman Emperor's, Ferdinand II, Catholic officials from a castle window, initiated the war in 1618.  After ruthless retaliation by Ferdinand, Bohemia was completely converted to Catholicism and defeated.

===Danish Phase (1625-1630)===

King Christian of Denmark supported north German Protestants.  Catholic general Albert Wallenstein was hired to defeat Protestant forces and restore Catholic land lost.  As a result of Austrian victories, Ferdinand II issues the Edict of Restitution in 1629, ordering that no longer could Protestants seize and secularize Catholic land.  In the Siege of Madgeburg, Wallenstein's mercenary force, out of control, massacred the entire town of Madgeburg, including both Protestants and Catholics.  Again, Austria is victorious, and Denmark is relatively easily defeated.

===Swedish Phase (1630-1635)===

Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus, devout Lutheran, came to Germany's aid.  Austria ultimately defeated Sweden, and it looked like peace was likely.  The Edict of Restitution was thus withdrawn.

===French/International Phase (1635-1648)===

Though a Catholic state, France had felt threatened by the strengthened Hapsburg Empire, and joined the war in 1635 on the side of the Protestants, thus ending the strictly religious character of the war.  A combined French/Swedish alliance triumphed over Hapsburg forces, while the Dutch, also allied to France, finally won their formal independence from Spain. In 1648, with all sides exhausted, a final series of peace treaties were prepared.

===Peace of Westphalia (1648)===

[[Image:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|250px|Map of Europe in 1648, after the Thirty Years' War]]

The Treaty of Westphalia ended the last major religious war in Europe.  The settlement would serve as a model for resolving conflict among warring European nations, as it represented the first time a diplomatic congress addressed and resolved a dispute.  This was the first time that all parties were brought together at once rather than two or three at a time.

====Beneficiaries of the Treaty of Westphalia====

* France, now the dominant power in Europe, surpassing Spain and Austria.  France also got Alsace-Loraine and wins the Thirty Years' War, stopping German unity.
* Dutch and the House of Orange.  Spain and the Holy Roman Empire finally recognized their independence, and for the next 60 years, were the leaders in trade, shipping, and a major economic powerhouse in Europe.
* Swiss.  They earned independence from the Holy Roman Empire.
* Sweden.  They now controlled the Baltic Sea and became the most powerful nation in the north.
* Prussia and the Hohenzollerns.  This marked the start of Prussia's rise as a great military power.
* German princes.  The princes now won sovereignty and could select Calvinism for their states.
* Protestants.  The Peace of Westphalia marked the end of the Counter-Reformation and Calvinism was now tolerated.

====Losers at Westphalia====

* Spain and the Spanish Hapsburgs.  The Spanish lost colonies and territorial possessions, resulting in a loss in income.
* The Holy Roman Empire, Austria, and the Austrian Hapsburgs.  1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman emperor and thus the influence of the Holy Roman Empire, as the princes are now sovereign.
* Catholicism.  The Peace of Westphalia marked the end of the enforced Counter-Reformation and thus the end of the church's supremacy and papal authority.
* German Unity.  Germany was kept disunited and was divided into hundreds of individual, sovereign states governed by princes.

== Introduction ==
[[Image:Portugal Império total.png|left|thumb|300px|The [[w:Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Empire]].]]
[[Image:Spanish Empire-World Map.png|left|thumb|300px|The [[w:Spanish Empire|Spanish Empire]].]]

During the fifteenth and the sixteenth century the states of Europe began their modern exploration of the world with a series of sea voyages. The Atlantic states of Spain and Portugal were foremost in this enterprise though other countries, notably England and the Netherlands, also took part. 

These explorations increased European knowledge of the wider world, particularly in relation to [[w:sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[w:Americas|Americas]]. These explorations were frequently connected to conquest and missionary work, as the states of Europe attempted to increase their influence, both in political and religious terms, throughout the world.

== Causes of the Age of Exploration ==

The explorers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had a variety of motivations, but were frequently motivated by the prospects of trade and wealth. The earliest explorations, round the coast of [[w:West Africa|West Africa]], were designed to bypass the trade routes that brought gold across the [[w:Sahara Desert|Sahara Desert]]. The improved naval techniques that developed then allowed Europeans to travel further afield, to India and, ultimately, to the Americas.

The early explorations of Spain and Portugal were particularly aided by new ship designs. Prior to the fifteenth century Spain and Portugal largely relied on a ship known as the ''[[w:Galley|galley]]''. Although galleys were fast and manoeuvrable, they were designed for use in the confined waters of the Mediterranean, and were unstable and inefficient in the open ocean. To cope with oceanic voyages, European sailors adapted a ship known as the ''[[w:Cog (ship)|cog]]'', largely used in the [[w:Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[w:North Sea|North Sea]], which they improved by adding sail designs used in the Islamic world. These new ships, known as ''[[w:Caravel|caravels]]'', had deep keels, which gave them stability, combined with [[w:lateen sails|lateen sails]], which allowed them to best exploit oceanic winds.

The [[w:astrolabe|astrolabe]] was a new navigational instrument in Europe that borrowed from the Islamic world, which used it in deserts. Using coordinates via the sky, one rotation of the astrolabe's plate, called a [[w:tympan|tympan]], represented the passage of one day, allowing sailors to approximate the time, direction in which they were sailing, and the number of days passed.  The astrolabe was replaced by the [[w:sextant|sextant]] as the chief navigational instrument in the 18th century.  The sextant measured celestial objects in relation to the horizon, as opposed to measuring them in relation to the instrument.  As a result, explorers were now able to sight the sun at noon and determine their latitude, which made this instrument more accurate than the astrolabe.

==Portuguese Roles in Early Exploration==

[[Image:Treatytordesillas.gif|thumb|right|300px|The [[w:Treaty of Tordesillas|Treaty of Tordesillas]] divided the entire globe in half. The result, ''pictured'', would result in incredible gains in wealth by Spain, who controlled the gold-laden continent of South America and the resource-rich Amazon River Basin.]]

In 1415, the Portuguese established a claim to some cities (Ceuta, Tangiers) on what is today the Kingdom of [[w:Morocco|Morocco]], and in 1433 they began the systematic exploration of the west African coast. In August 1492, [[w:Christopher Columbus|Christopher Columbus]], whose nationality is still today subject to much debate, set sail on behalf of [[w:Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[w:Isabella of Castile|Isabella]] whose marriage had united their crowns forming what is still today the Kingdom of Spain, and on October 12 of that same year, he eventually reached the Bahamas thinking it was the [[w:East Indies|East Indies]]. In his mind he had reached the eastern end of the rich lands of India and China described in the thirteenth century by the Venetian explorer Marco Polo.

As a result, a race for more land, especially in the so-called &quot;East Indies&quot; arose. In 1481, a papal decree granted all land south of the [[w:Canary Islands|Canary Islands]] to Portugal, however, and the areas explored by Columbus were thus Portuguese territories. In 1493, the Spanish-descendant [[w:Pope Alexander VI|Pope Alexander VI]], declared that all lands west of the longitude of the [[w:Cape Verde Islands|Cape Verde Islands]] should belong to Spain while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. These events led to increasing tension between the two powers given the fact that the king of Portugal saw the role of Pope Alexander VI Borgia as biased towards Spain. His role in the matter is still today a matter of strong controversy between European historians of that period.

The resolution to this occurred in 1494 at the [[w:Treaty of Tordesillas|Treaty of Tordesillas]], creating, after long and tense diplomatic negotiations between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, a dividing line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Portugal received the west African Coast and the Indian Ocean route to India, as well as part of the Pacific Ocean waterways, while Spain gained the Western Atlantic Ocean and the lands further to the west. «Unknowingly», Portugal received Brazil. King John II of Portugal, however, seems to have had prior knowledge of the location of that Brazilian territory, for in the difficult negotiations of the Treaty of Tordesillas he managed, in a move still open for debate amongst historians of the period today, to push the dividing line further to the west, making it possible to celebrate the official discovery of Brazil and the reclaiming of the land only in 1500, already under the auspices of the treaty.

==Important Portuguese Explorers==

===Prince Henry (1394–1460)===	
Prince Henry &quot;the Navigator&quot; financially supported various voyages. He created a school for the advancement of navigation, laying the groundwork for Portugal to become a leader in the Age of Exploration.

===Bartolomeu Dias (1450-1500)===
[[w:Bartolomeu Dias|Bartolomeu Dias]], the first European to sail around the [[w:Cape of Good Hope|Cape of Good Hope]], also found that India was reachable by sailing around the coast of the continent. As a result, trade with Asia and India was made considerably easier because travellers would no longer have to travel through the Middle East. Thus, there was a rise in Atlantic trading countries and a decline in Middle East and Mediterranean countries.

===Vasco da Gama (1460–1524)===
[[w:Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] was the first to successfully sail directly from Europe to India in 1498. This was an important step for Europe because it created a sea route from Europe that would allow trade with the Far East instead of using the [[w:Silk Road|Silk Road Caravan route]].

===Pedro Álvares Cabral (1467–1520)===
On April 21, 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral accidentally discovered Brazil while seeking a western route to the Indies. He first landed in modern-day Bahia.

===Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521)===
[[w:Ferdinand_Magellan|Magellan]] was a Portuguese explorer sailing in a Spanish expedition, and was the first person to sail the Pacific Ocean and around South America. He attempted to circumnavigate the globe but died in the Philippines, although his crew successfully completed the voyage. One of his ships led by Juan Sebastian Elcano, who took over after Magellan died, made all the way around the globe!

===Francis Xavier (1506 –1552)===
Francis Xavier was a Spanish missionary, born in the  castle of Xavier, a village near the city of Pamplona, from where he has his name. He was a member of the nobility and during his student years in Paris he became friends with Ignacio de Loiola with whom he would found the Jesuit Order
He travelled extensively around Africa,  India, the South Pacific, and even Japan and China.

==Early Spanish Explorers==

There were a number of other important explorers that were involved in the Age of Exploration.

===Francisco Pizarro (1529-1541)===

[[w:Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] was a Spanish explorer who militarily fought and conquered the [[w:Incan|Incan]] people and culture, claiming most of South America for Spain. He gained immense gold and riches for Spain from the defeat of the Incan empire.

===Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)===

[[w:Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], an explorer thought to be of Genoa (Italy), who after many unsuccessful attempts at finding patronship, explored the possibility of a western passage to the East Indies for the Spanish crown. Due to miscalculations on the circumference of the world Columbus did not account for the possibility of another series of continents between Europe and Asia, Columbus discovered the Caribbean in 1492. He introduced Spanish trade with the Americas which allowed for an exchange of cultures, diseases and trade goods, known as [[w:The Columbian Exchange|The Grand Exchange]], whose consequences, good and bad, are still being experienced today.

===Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521)===

[[w:Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] was a Portuguese explorer who served the King of Spain, and was the first person to sail the Pacific Ocean and around South America. He attempted to be the first to circumnavigate the globe but was killed in the Philippines. His crew managed to successfully complete the voyage under the leadership of the Spanish Juan Sebastian del Cano.  His parents had died when he was ten years old and he was sent to Lisbon in Portugal when he was twelve.

===Vasco Nuñez de Balboa (1475-1519)===

[[w:Vasco Nuñez de Balboa|Balboa]] was a Spanish [[w:conquistador|conquistador]] who founded the colony of [[w:Darién Province|Darién]] in Panama. He was the first to see the Pacific Ocean from America, and he settled much of the island of [[w:Hispaniola|Hispaniola]].

===Hernando Cortés (1485-1547)===

[[w:Hernando Cortés|Cortés]] was a Spanish conquistador who assembled an army from the Spanish Colonies consisting of 600 men, 15 horsemen and 15 cannons. Using the assistance of a translator, [[w:Doña Marina|Doña Marina]], he assembled alliances with discontented subdued tribes in the Aztec empire. Through decisive use of superior weapons and native assistance, also the help of European disease which had already wrecked native populations, successfully conquered the [[w:Aztec empire|Aztecs]] capturing [[w:Motezuma|Montezuma II]], the current emperor, the city of Tenochtitlan and looting large amounts of Aztec gold.

===Bartolomé de las Casas (1484-1566)===

[[w:Bartolomé de las Casas|Las Casas]] was a Spanish priest who advocated civil rights for Native Americans and strongly protested the way they were enslaved and badly treated.  He wrote ''[[w:A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies|A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' and ''De thesauris in Peru''.

===Juan Ponce de León (1474-1521)===
[[w:Juan Ponce de León|Juan Ponce de León]] was a Spanish conquistador hailing from Valladolid, Spain. He had served as the Governor of Puerto Rico when he started his own expedition in 1513, discovering Florida on March 27 of the same year and reaching its eastern coast on April 2.  He called the land ''Florida'' (Spanish for flowery),  either because of the vegetation he saw there, or it was Easter (Spanish: ''Pascua Florida'') that time. De Leon then organized subsequent voyages to Florida; the last one occurring in 1521 when he died.

== English Explorers ==
===Sir Francis Drake (1540-1596)===
[[w:Sir Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] was a letter of marque, one who is a privateer, for Britain during the time of [[w:Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Though he is most remembered for helping command the English fleet against the [[w:Spanish Armada in 1588|Spanish Armada]], he also spent many years in the Caribbean and successfully circumnavigated the world between 1577-1580.

===John Cabot (1450-1499)===

John Cabot, originally Giovanni Caboto was born in Genoa, Italy.

== French Explorers ==
===Rene-Robert de La Salle ===
LaSalle was born in Rouen, France. He originally studied to be a Jesuit, but left the school to find adventure. He sailed to a French colony in Canada and became a fur trader. Indians told him of two great rivers (the Mississippi and Ohio). He made several explorations of them. He died when his men revelled in about 1687.

===Father Jacques Marquette===
Marquette was born in Laon, France, in the summer of 1637. He joined the Jesuits at age seventeen. The Jesuits told him to go be a missionary in Quebec. He founded missions all over the place. He explored many rivers. He died, age 38.

===Louis Jolliet===
Jolliet was born in a settlement near Quebec City. He was going to be a Jesuit priest, but abandoned these plans. He explored many rivers with Marquette. His place and date of death is unknown.

===Jacques Cartier (1491-1551)===

Jacques Cartier was an explorer who claimed Canada for France. He was born in Saint Malo, France in 1491. He was also the first European, not just the first Frenchman to describe and chart Saint Lawrence River and Gulf of Saint Lawrence. He made three important voyages. He died in Saint Malo, in 1551, aged 65.

===Samuel de Champlain (1567-1635)===
Samuel de Champlain was the &quot;Father of New France&quot;. Founded Quebec City and today Lake Champlain is named in his honor.

==Dutch Explorers==
In the late 16th century Dutch explorers began to head out all over the world.

===Willem Barentsz (1550-1597)===
On June 5, 1594 Barentsz left the island of Texel aboard the small ship Mercury, as part of a group of three ships sent out in separate directions to try and enter the Kara Sea, with the hopes of finding the Northeast passage above Siberia. During this journey he discovered what is today Bjørnøya, also known as Bear Island.

Later in the journey, Barentsz reached the west coast of Novaya Zemlya, and followed it northward before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs. Although they did not reach their ultimate goal, the trip was considered a success.

Setting out on June 2 1595, the voyage went between the Siberian coast and Vaygach Island. On August 30, the party came across approximately 20 Samoyed &quot;wilde men&quot; with whom they were able to speak, due to a crewmember speaking their language. September 4 saw a small crew sent to States Island to search for a type of crystal that had been noticed earlier. The party was attacked by a polar bear, and two sailors were killed.

Eventually, the expedition turned back upon discovering that unexpected weather had left the Kara Sea frozen. This expedition was largely considered to be a failure.

In May of 1596, he set off once again, returning to Bear Island. Barentsz reached Novaya Zemlya on July 17. Anxious to avoid becoming entrapped in the surrounding ice, he intended to head for the Vaigatch Strait, but became stuck within the many icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice, along with their young cabin boy.

Proving successful at hunting, the group caught 26 Arctic foxes in primitive traps, as well as killing a number of polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, the scurvy-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea on June 13. Barentsz died while studying charts only seven days after starting out, but it took seven more weeks for the boats to reach Kola where they were rescued.

===Henry Hudson (1565-1611)===
In 1609, Hudson was chosen by the Dutch East India Company to find an easterly passage to Asia. He was told to sail around the Arctic Ocean north of Russia, into the Pacific and to the Far East. Hudson could not continue his voyage due to the ice that had plagued his previous voyages, and many others before him. Having heard rumors by way of Jamestown and John Smith, he and his crew decided to try to seek out a Southwest Passage through North America.

After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, his ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), sailed around briefly in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, but Hudson concluded that these waterways did not lead to the Pacific.

He then sailed up to the river that today bears his name, the Hudson River. He made it as far as present-day Albany, New York, where the river narrows, before he was forced to turn around, realizing that it was not the Southwest Passage.

Along the way, Hudson traded with numerous native tribes and obtained different shells, beads and furs. His voyage established Dutch claims to the region and the fur trade that prospered there. New Amsterdam in Manhattan became the capital of New Netherland in 1625

===Willem Janszoon (1571-1638)===
Early in Willem's life,1601 and 1602, he set out on two trips to the Dutch possessions in the East Indies. On November 18, 1605, he sailed from Bantam to the coast of western New Guinea. He then crossed the eastern end of the Arafura Sea, without seeing the Torres Strait, into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and on February 26 1606 made landfall at the Pennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near the modern town of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Willem Janszoon proceeded to chart some 320 km of the coastline, which he thought to be a southerly extension of New Guinea.

Willem Janszoon returned to the Netherlands in the belief that the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which he coasted, and Dutch maps reproduced this error for many years to come.

Janszoon reported that on July 31, 1618 he had landed on an island at 22° South with a length of 22 miles and 240 miles SSE of the Sunda Strait. This is generally interpreted as a description of the peninsula from Point Cloate to North West Cape on the Western Australian coast, which Janszoon presumed was an island without fully circumnavigating it.

===Abel Tasman (1603-1659)===
In 1634 Tasman was sent as second in command of an exploring expedition in the north Pacific. His fleet included the ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen. After many hardships Formosa (now Taiwan) was reached in November, 40 out of the crew of 90 having died. Other voyages followed, to Japan in 1640 and 1641 and to Palembang in the south of Sumatra in 1642, where he made a friendly trading treaty with the Sultan. In August 1642 Tasman was sent in command of an expedition for the discovery of the &quot;Unknown Southland&quot;, which was believed to be in the south Pacific but which had not been seen by Europeans

On November 24, 1642 Tasman sighted the west coast of Tasmania near Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land after Anthony van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east until he was off Cape Frederick Hendrick on the Forestier Peninsula. An attempt at landing was made but the sea was too rough; however, the carpenter swam through the surf, and, planting a flag, Tasman claimed formal possession of the land on December 3, 1642.

Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. On December 13 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island, New Zealand. After some exploration he sailed further east, and nine days later was the first European known to sight New Zealand, which he named Staten Landt on the assumption that it was connected to an island (Staten Island, Argentina) at the south of the tip of South America. Proceeding north and then east one of his boats was attacked by Māori in waka, and four of his men were killed.

En route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on January 21, 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia before making his way back into the open sea. He eventually turned north-west to New Guinea, and arrived at Batavia on June 15, 1643.

With three ships on his second voyage (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek) in 1644, he followed the south coast of New Guinea eastward. He missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage along the Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on the land and its people.

From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans - mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident

==Results of the Age of Exploration==

The Age of Exploration led, directly to new communication and trade routes being established and the first truly global businesses to be established. Tea, several exotic fruits and new technologies were also introduced into Europe. 

It also led to the decimation and extinction of Natives in other nations due to European diseases and poor working conditions.  It also led indirectly to an increase in slavery (which was already widely practised throughout the world), as the explorations led to a rise in supply and thus demand for [[w:cotton|cotton]], [[w:indigo|indigo]], and [[w:tobacco|tobacco]].

Finally, as a result of the Age of Exploration, Spain dominated the end of the sixteenth century.  The Age of Exploration provided the foundation for the European political and commercial worldwide imperialism of the late 1800s. From 1580 to 1640 Spain would inherit the right to reign over Portugal, whose interests where now in the hands of its political and geographical neighbour. Spain's power, under Spanish leader [[w:Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], was bigger than ever before and renewed and financed the power of the Papacy to fight against Protestant Reformation. However, in the seventeenth century, as the explorations were coming to an end and money was becoming scarcer, other countries began to openly challenge the spirit of the Tordesilas treaty and the power of Spain, which began to lapse and lose its former power.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The era of absolutism, exemplified by the &quot;Sun King&quot; Louis XIV Bourbon of France, marks the rise of rulers throughout Europe who had absolute power over their nations.  Mercantilism became the primary form of economy of the day, and the issue of religion disappeared in European wars, now replaced by the issue of the balance of power.
&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

== Louis XIV (1638-1715), Model of Absolutism ==

[[Image:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|right|180px|'''Louis XIV'''&lt;br&gt;King of France and of Navarre&lt;br&gt;''By [[w:Hyacinthe Rigaud|Hyacinthe Rigaud]] (1701)'']]

Louis XIV Bourbon of France rose to power in 1643.  He was married to Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV.  His power stemmed from the fact that during his reign he maintained a powerful, unified France.  Louis and William III Stuart of Orange were arch-enemies during this time; however, Louis maintained the upper hand and was on the offensive against William during that time.

Louis desired control over the Netherlands because of its economic power as a result of trade, because he wanted to crush Calvinists and Protestants, and because he desired increased territory.  Indeed, he advised his heir, Louis XV, &quot;Do not imitate me in my taste for war.&quot; His aggressive policy demanded to finance the largest European army of 280,000 men.

Louis' wars resulted in horrendous results and poverty for the French people, and Protestants despised Louis.  His economic policy was headed by Colbert, and his nation was a model in enacting mercantilism. During his reign, France became the dominant country in language, culture, and dress.

Louis allegedly famously declared, &quot;L'etat c'est moi,&quot; or &quot;I am the state,&quot; and his reign exemplifies absolutism.  French Bishop Bossuet declared that it was the divine right of monarchs to rule, concluding that kings were God's anointed representatives on earth.  Louis acted upon this belief, governing France as if he were placed on earth by God to rule.

Overall, Louis' foreign goals were territorial expansion and the spread of Catholicism.

Louis was highly successful in his domestic ambitions to achieve absolute power through centralized bureaucracy.  He successfully controlled rebellious nobles and made himself the center of French power and culture.  People depended upon him for advancement and thrived on his goodwill.  Louis also established the palace at Versailles, which took fourteen years to construct.  Versailles was modeled by every other major European country, and it successfully kept nobles occupied, distracting them from the desire to have a say in government.  In 1685, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes, stripping Calvinists of their rights in France.

== The War of Spanish Succession ==

[[Image:Charles II (1670-80).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Charles II in his twenties]]

Philip IV Hapsburg of Spain married Marianna Hapsburg of Austria, and the two of them produced Charles II, the physically and mentally retarded ruler of Spain.  Since Charles was incapable of producing heirs, upon his death bed he was left to decide who would rule Spain after his death.  France argued that they had the best claim to the throne, since they were Catholic, strong, and Charles' half-sister was married to Louis XIV.  As a result, Charles left the throne to Philip V Bourbon, the grandson of Louis XIV.  War broke out as a result, pitting a coalition led by William III Orange of the Netherlands against France in an effort to maintain the European balance of power.  The war resulted in the Peace of Utrecht (via the [[w:Treaty of Utrecht|Treaty of Utrecht]]), at which it was agreed that the ruler of Spain had to give up his or her claim to the French throne.  Thus, Philip was recognized as the King of Spain, but the unification of France and Spain was barred. Spain also lost its territories in Belgium and Italy at the Peace of Utrecht, a source of much resentment of Spaniards towards their new government.


==The Balance of Power in Foreign Policy==

The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.  The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.  The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.  This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious wars.  Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.

== The Economics of Mercantilism ==

The overall purpose of mercantilism was that mercantilist policies enriched the economy, thus resulting in prosperous citizens, higher tax revenues, and in the end funds for military and war.  During the 1600s, mercantilist policies were adopted by most European nations.

=== Key Characteristics ===

By exporting more goods than your country imports, gold and silver will flow into your country.  The government should found colonies, gaining raw materials, and then the nation should sell finished goods back to the colony.  The government should impose high external tariffs, helping to keep competing goods from other nations out and to protect native manufacturing, thus raising money for the government.  The government should eliminate all internal tariffs, keeping goods flowing freely within the country.  Finally, the nation should become self-sufficient in all of its needs.

== The Rise of Prussia (1701-1740)==

Prussia became the power in northern Germany, as opposed to Austria which lay in the south.  The issue of German Dualism arose - specifically asking the question, which of the two would unite Germany?

=== Problems During Prussia's Rise ===

Prussia faced a number of problems during its rise to power.  One major issue was that Prussia was divided into three sections that needed to be united - the central part, Brandenburg, which contained Berlin; the eastern part, called Prussia, and western territories.  In addition, Prussia had few natural resources, a much smaller population than the other major powers in Europe, and was still suffering from the effects of the Thirty Years' War.

=== Prussia Rises ===

Under Frederick William &quot;The Great Elector&quot;, Prussia became highly militaristic, with all aspects society entirely bent toward the needs of the army.  He doubled the army to 80,000 soldiers. It was still small compared to other powers, but it was the most well-trained and the most efficient on the continent.

Frederick William strengthened the Prussian army by enlisting Prussian citizens rather than mercenaries in what was known as the Canton system (not to be confused with the Chinese trade system).  He cut all royal expenses, especially court life, and imposed high taxes on the lower and middle class.  State service was required for the nobility, known as Junkers, and they frequently served as army officers while the peasants served as infantry.  There was very strict social stratification.  Government-subsidized textile industries resulted in standardized uniforms, and all members of the military were also required to maintain standardized hair and facial hair.  Frederick established the first efficient bureaucracy in Europe, and was especially religiously tolerant, welcoming 20,000 Huguenot refugees after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes.

== Stuart England 1603-1714 ==

In 1603, Elizabeth I died without leaving an inheritance  and her nephew, James VI of Scotland (who was also the son of Mary Queen of Scots who was ordered to be executed under Elizabeth's orders in 1589) took the English throne as James I, making both Scotland and England ruled under the same monarch, and establishing the Stuart dynasty. However the two nations were anything but united - they each had different religions, laws, courts, parliaments, churches and customs, not forgetting a 700 year old mistrust and hatred.

=== James I 1603-1625 ===

James I Stuart ruled as an absolute monarch, who despised Parliament.  He went as far as to dissolve parliament, and ruled without the voice of the people.  He declared that the monarch was God's Lieutenant, his emissary, and reigned supreme over the land.  He began the absolute rule of England, followed by his family for the next several generations.  James advocated the divine rights of kings, and in turn wrote a book advocating the divine right of kings entitled ''The Trew Law of Free Monarchies'' in 1598.

=== Charles I 1625-1649 ===

When Charles took the throne, he inherited a very angry Parliament, but he shared his father James I's beliefs in autocracy.  He appointed Archbishop Laud to make the Anglican church more ceremonial, like Catholicism, instilling fears among the populace about a return to Catholicism.

In 1628 the Parliament issued the Petition of Right. This document declared that Charles could not enact taxes without Parliamentary consent. Charles proceeded to levy the ship money tax without Parliamentary consent, ordering all towns to pay taxes to support the English navy. This angered most of the populace as ship money was traditionally paid by coastal towns. The Parliament of 1640, dominated by Puritan landowners, fired Laud and repealed taxes imposed by Charles. These occurrences resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War.

=== English Civil War 1642-1649 ===

The war pitted supporters of the Parliament against supporters of the king, and at stake were both political power and control of English economics.  The war also pitted Puritans, known as &quot;roundheads,&quot; against Anglicans, or &quot;cavaliers.&quot;  The supporters of Parliament were led by Oliver  Cromwell.

Other movements sprang up during this time, including Baptists, Quakers, and diggers, seekers, and ranters, who equated  the clergy with nobles.

Charles I was captured, and members of Parliament were torn.  Presbyterians opposed the killing of the king, while Independents advocated the regicide, or the killing of the king.  In &quot;Pride's Purge,&quot; Cromwell forcibly removed all members of Parliament who opposed the killing of the king.

=== The Governments of Cromwell ===

Afterwards, Cromwell formed a new government called the Commonwealth, which lasted from 1649 until 1653.  This government was a democratic republic.  However, in 1653, Cromwell formed the Protectorate, which was effectively a military dictatorship. He created the New Model Army, a paid force of devoted Puritans. His reign involved very strict laws, including no playing cards nor dancing. He, like many English monarchs, found Parliament difficult to control, it was when he disbanded Parliament, the only English Constitution was written, &quot;Instruments of Government.&quot;

=== Stuart Restoration and Charles II Stuart ===

In 1660, Cromwell resigned, resulting in the restoration of Charles II Stuart and thus the Stuart line to the throne.  Charles II is commonly known as the &quot;Merry Monarch&quot; because he engaged in highly festive court life and encountered many mistresses.  He did, however, drive England deeply into debt, and continued a war with the Dutch started under Cromwell from the 1650s until the 1670s.  He practised mercantilist policies.  During Charles II's reign, England encountered the Great Plague in 1665 and the Great Fire in 1666.

In 1670, Charles signed the Secret Treaty of Dover with Louis XIV, secretly pledging France and England as allies to work together to return England to the Catholic Church.  In 1673 he signed the Declaration of Indulgence, which stated that Catholics could hold political and military office.  Parliament responded that same year, issuing the Test Act, that stated that citizens would have to profess Anglicanism to join the Parliament and military by taking Anglican communion.

=== James II 1685-1688 ===

[[Image:James_II_of_England.jpg|thumb|left|200px|James II Stuart of England]]

James II, an overtly Catholic monarch, took the throne in 1685.  With his first wife he bore two daughters, Mary and Anne, who were both Protestant, but with his second wife he bore a son, James, who was baptised Catholic. He upset Parliament at his demand to repeal the Test Act, and instituted the Declaration of Indulgences, which allowed for freedom of worship. Angry Protestants would call in William the Stadholder and Mary to bail them out.

=== Glorious Revolution of 1688 ===

Out of fear of James' open Catholicism and the birth of a male Catholic heir, Parliament invited Mary Stuart and William Stuart of Orange to rule England in 1688.  Known as the Glorious Revolution or Bloodless Revolution because it was peaceful, William and Mary took the throne and signed the Bill of Rights.  The bill guaranteed that the king would call Parliament every three years and not dismiss them, and that taxation and war must be approved by Parliament.  England was no longer an absolute monarchy but rather a constitutional monarchy.

In 1701, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement, stating that all future monarchs of England must be Protestant above all other characteristics.

=== Queen Anne Stuart and the End of the Stuart Line ===

Queen Anne ruled from 1702 until 1714, and issued the Act of Union in 1707, creating Great Britain by combining Wales, Scotland, and England.  Under her, the House of Commons took dominance in Parliament. When she died in August 1714, she was succeeded by George I, the first of the Hanoverian line to rule in Britain. The expansion of parliamentary power at the expense of the Crown that had taken place since 1688 would continue under the Hanoverian monarchs, with the first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, taking office in 1721. By the accession of George III in 1760, the Crown had very little ability to influence national politics, and largely left the formation of governments to the parties that were slowly evolving in Parliament.

== The Glorious Dutch Republic ==

===Culture and Economy===

[[Image:Dutch Empire35.PNG|thumb|400px|Dutch possessions]]


For a period in the 1600s called the ''Dutch Golden Age'', the Dutch were the commercial, shipping, and financial leaders of Europe. They were also recognized for creating one of the most urbane and tolerant societies in Europe. Amsterdam became a centre of commerce, largely because of the sacking of Antwerp, and the Bank of Amsterdam led the entire European world in banking.

As a result of their trade, the Dutch were the wealthiest and most prosperous nation.  There was a vast appreciation for the arts, and some of the most famous Baroque artists were Dutch, such as Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Reubens.  Dutch society promoted freedom of expression and religious tolerance, with a wide array of religions from atheists to Catholics.  There was a large and well-established middle class, and an excellent educational system.  Finally, the Dutch had a confederative republic with a large amount of freedom for self governance of its provinces while most other European nations were still undergoing absolutist regimes.

===Overseas Colonies===
The Dutch East India Company began immediately to prise away the string of coastal fortresses that at the time comprised the Portuguese Empire. The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favourable monsoon winds. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the Latin name for Holland, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. Malacca finally succumbed in 1641 (after a second attempt to capture it), Colombo in 1656, Ceylon in 1658, Nagappattinam in 1662 and Cranganore and Cochin in 1662. Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was attacked by the Dutch twice in 1603 and 1610, on both occasions unsuccessfully. Whilst the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture Macau from where Portugal monopolised the lucrative China-Japan trade, the Japanese shogunate's increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent sakoku policy, for two hundred years the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to Hirado and then from 1641 at Deshima.

By 1650, the Dutch had overtaken Portugal as the dominant player in the spice and silk trade, and in 1652 founded a colony at Cape Town on the coast of South Africa, as a way-station for its ships on the route between Europe and Asia.

In the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip on the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on their homeward bound voyage. Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition. In 1628, Piet Heyn captured the entire Spanish treasure fleet, and made off with a vast fortune in precious metals and goods that enabled the Company two years later to pay its shareholders a cash dividend of 70%, though the Company was to have relatively few other successes against the Spanish. In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, an expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. By 1650, the West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had occupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire in order to guarantee access to the islands' salt-pans.

Unlike in Asia, Dutch successes against the Portuguese in Brazil and Africa were short-lived. Years of settlement had left large Portuguese communities under the rule of the Dutch, who were by nature traders rather than colonisers. In 1645, the Portuguese community at Pernambuco rebelled against their Dutch masters, and by 1654, the Dutch had been ousted from Brazil. In the intervening years, a Portuguese expedition had been sent from Brazil to recapture Luanda in Angola, by 1648 the Dutch were expelled from there also.

On the north-east coast of North America, the West India Company took over a settlement that had been established by the Company of New Netherland (1614-18) at Fort Orange at Albany on the Hudson River, relocated from Fort Nassau which had been founded in 1614. The Dutch had been sending ships annually to the Hudson River to trade fur since Henry Hudson's voyage of 1609. In order to protect its precarious position at Albany from the nearby English and French, the Company founded the fortified town of New Amsterdam in 1625 at the mouth of the Hudson, encouraging settlement of the surrounding areas of Long Island and New Jersey. The fur trade ultimately proved impossible for the Company to monopolise due to the massive illegal private trade in furs, and the settlement of New Netherland was unprofitable. In 1655, the nearby colony of New Sweden on the Delaware River was forcibly absorbed into New Netherland after ships and soldiers were sent to capture it by the Dutch governor, Pieter Stuyvesant.

Ever since its inception, the Dutch East India Company had been in competition with its counterpart, the English East India Company, founded two years earlier but with a capital base eight times smaller, for the same goods and markets in the East. In 1619, the rivalry resulted in the Amboyna massacre, when several English Company men were executed by agents of the Dutch. The event remained a source of English resentment for several decades, and in the late 1620s the English Company shifted its focus to from Indonesia to India.

===Anglo-Dutch Wars===
In 1651, the English parliament passed the first of the Navigation Acts which excluded Dutch shipping from the lucrative trade between England and its Caribbean colonies, and led directly to the outbreak of hostilities between the two countries the following year. The war would prove to be indecisive, but the English had failed to replace the Dutch as the leader of World trade. 

The Second Anglo-Dutch War was precipitated in 1664 when English forces moved to capture New Netherland. After two years of war, the Dutch, led by Michiel de Ruyter,destroyed or captured much of the British fleet at Medway, and England was forced to sue for peace. Under the Treaty of Breda (1667), New Netherland was ceded to England in exchange for the English settlements in Suriname, which had been conquered by Dutch forces earlier that year. 

===Wars With France===
In 1672 the French invaded the Republic, starting the Franco-Dutch War and were only stopped when they reached the Dutch Water Line. England and France had secretly agreed to split the Netherlands between themselves, but after defeats at sea, and unable to cross the waterline, the French Army began a slow and cautious retreat out of the Republic. Peace was signed in 1678.

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw the Dutch William of Orange invade England, and ascend to the throne, ending Fifty years of rivalry between the Netherlands and England, and brought the two countries into the Nine Years' War against France the same year. The Anglo-Dutch fleet(mostly Dutch) dominated the seas, and France was unsuccessful.

== Peter Romanov the Great of Russia (1689-1723) ==

Peter installed an absolute monarchy in Russia, with absolutely no concept of the social contract.  Serfdom still remained strong in Russia, with no middle class nor urbanization.  In Russia, advancement was based upon merit rather than birth or blood line.

The ultimate goal of Peter's foreign policy was to obtain warm water ports for his nation, which were essential for trade, naval power, and access to the west.  He battled Sweden for a port on the Baltic and with the Ottoman Turks for a port on the Black Sea.  In the Great Northern War against Sweden, Russia defeated the Swedish army in Poltava by using the [[w:scorched earth policy|scorched earth policy]], in which the Russians retreat, burn the crops or villages in the town, and wait for winter to take its toll upon the enemy troops.  As a result, the Russians successfully obtained their warm water port on the Baltic, which was named St. Petersburg and known as the &quot;window to the west.&quot;

Peter enacted the &quot;Great Embassy,&quot; which was a tour of Peter and his nobles through many Western European nations.  The ultimate goal of the Great Embassy was to use the information collected to &quot;westernize&quot; Russia, as Peter was afraid of increasing Western power.  Through the Great Embassy, Peter acquired many important technological skills, especially military technology, such as naval instruments, army tactics, ship building techniques, and naval strategy.  He imported foreign workers with technological skills as well, and introduced new attire that was being worn across the rest of Europe.  He implemented the Julian calendar, which although was not the modern Gregorian calendar at the time, was more modern than what was being used in the past.  He established much better education, and he also established the first modern Russian army with 200,000 men.  Nobles were required to perform state service in either the army or the bureaucracy.

== Baroque Art ==
Baroque Art came to existence during the 1600s and lasted through the mid-1700s.  Baroque art was used by Catholics in the Counter-Reformation.  Baroque Art can be characterized by its rich and vibrant colors, its intense use of light, great drama, and exuberance.  Unlike Renaissance art, which usually depicted mellow scenes, Baroque Art captured the climax of a scene.  It used dynamic lighting to create a &quot;spotlight&quot; effect on the canvas.

Baroque art was used in archetecture, art, and even music. This form of work was included in the building of St. Petersburg.

===Caravaggio===

Caravaggio was a famous Italian painter for the Catholic Counter-Reformation, painting such works as ''Judith Slaying Holofernes'' and ''The Incredulity of St. Thomas''.  He introduced dramatic light and dark effects, and he helped transition from mannerism to new Baroque styles.

===Bernini===

Bernini was a famous Italian sculptor, who perhaps most famously created ''The Ecstasy of St. Theresa''.  This sculpture was of the mystic nun in a trance in the height of religious rapture.  Bernini was one of the first masters to realize the importance of the effect of light.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
The Age of Science of the 1600s and the Enlightenment of the 1700s, also dubbed the Age of Enlightenment, introduced countless new concepts to European society.  These ideas continue to permeate modern society. Many modern institutions have much of their foundations in the ideals of these times.

== An Era of Enlightened Rulers ==
A new form of government began to replace absolutism across the continent. Whilst monarchs were reluctant to give up their powers, many also recognized that their states could potentially benefit from the spread of Enlightenment ideas. The most prominent of these rulers were Frederick II the Great Hohenzollern of Prussia, Joseph II Hapsburg of Austria, and Catherine II the Great Romanov of Russia.

In order to understand the actions of the European monarchs of this period, it is important to understand their key beliefs. Enlightened despots rejected the concept of absolutism and the divine right to rule.  They justified their position based on their usefulness to the state.  These rulers based their decisions upon their reason, and they stressed religious toleration and the importance of education.  They enacted codified, uniform laws, repressed local authority, nobles, and the church, and often acted impulsively and instilled change at an incredibly fast rate.

=== Catherine the Great 1762-1796===
Catherine the Great came to power because Peter III failed to bear a male heir to the throne and was killed.

Her enlightened reforms include:

* Restrictions on torture
* Religious toleration
* Education for girls
* 1767 Legislative Commission, which reported to her on the state of the Russian people
* Trained and educated her grandson Alexander I so that he could progress in society because of his merit rather than his blood line

She was friends with Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire. However, Catherine also took a number of decidedly unenlightened actions.  In 1773 she violently suppressed Pugachev's Rebellion, a massive peasant rebellion against the degradation of the serfs.  She conceded more power to the nobles and eliminated state service.  Also, serfdom became equivalent to slavery under her.

==== Foreign Policy ====
Catherine combated the Ottoman Empire.  In 1774, Russia gained a warm water port on the Black Sea.

=== Frederick II the Great 1740-1786 ===
Frederick II Hohenzollern of Prussia declared himself &quot;The First Servant of the State,&quot; believing that it was his duty to serve the state and do well for his nation.  He extended education to all classes, and established a professional bureaucracy and civil servants.  He created a uniform judicial system and abolished torture.  During his tenure, Prussia innovated agriculture by using potatoes and turnips to replenish the soil.  Also, Frederick established religious freedom in Prussia.

=== Joseph II Habsburg 1765-1790 ===
Joseph II Habsburg (also spelled as Hapsburg) of Austria could be considered perhaps the greatest enlightened ruler, and he was purely enlightened, working solely for the good of his country.  He was anti-feudalism, anti-church, and anti-nobility.  He famously stated, &quot;The state should provide the greatest good for the greatest number.&quot;  He created equal punishment and taxation regardless of class, complete freedom of the press, toleration of all religions, and civil rights for Jews.  Under Joseph II a uniform law code was established, and in 1781 he abolished serfdom and in 1789 ordered the General School Ordinance, which required compulsory education for Austrian children.  However, Joseph failed because he angered people by making changes far too swiftly, and even the serfs weren't satisfied with their abrupt freedom.

=== England ===
As a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, England already had a Parliament and thus the concept of enlightened ruler did not take hold in England.

=== France ===
After Louis XIV the &quot;Sun King,&quot; Louis XV took control from 1715 until 1774.  Like his predecessor, he was an absolute monarch who enacted mercantilism.  As a result of the influence and control of absolutism in France, France also did not encounter an enlightened ruler.  In order to consummate an alliance between his nation and Austria, Maria Theresa of Austria married her daughter, Marie Antoinette, to Louis XV's heir, Louis XVI.  Louis XV recognized that the fragile institutions of absolutism were crumbling in France, and he famously stated, ''&quot;Après moi, le déluge&quot;'', or &quot;After me, the flood.&quot;

==A War-Torn Europe==
=== War of Austrian Succession ===
The war of Austrian Succession of 1740 to 1748 pitted Austria, England, and the Dutch against Prussia, France, and Spain.  Upon Maria Theresa's acquisition of the Austrian throne, Frederick the Great of Prussia attacked Silesia, and war broke out.  In 1748 peace came at the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle.  The treaty preserved the balance of power and the ''status quo ante bellum''.  Austria survived but lost Silesia, which began &quot;German Dualism&quot; or the fight between Prussia and Austria over who would dominate and eventually unite Germany.

=== The Seven Years War ===
The peace in 1748 was recognized as temporary by all, and in 1756 Austria and France allied in what was known as the Diplomatic Revolution.  The reversal of the traditional France versus Austria situation occurred as a result of both nation's fear of a rising, militant Prussia.  To consummate the marriage, Louis XVI married Marie Antionette.  The Seven Years War engaged Austria, France, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Saxony against Prussia and England.  The purpose of the war was to annihilate Prussia, and took place at a number of fronts: in Europe, in America (where American citizens know it as the French and Indian War) and in India.  At the Peace of Paris in 1763, the war concluded, and Prussia retained all of its territory, including Silesia.  France ceded Canada to Britain and the North American interior to Spain, and removed its armies from India.  It did, however, get to keep its West Indies colonies.

At this point, Great Britain became the supreme naval power and it began its domination of India.

=== The Partitioning of Poland ===
Poland was first partitioned on February 19, 1772, between Russia, Austria, and Prussia, in an agreement between them to gain more land and power in Europe.  Poland was able to be partitioned because it was weak and had no ability to stop the larger and more powerful nations.  The balance of power was not taken into consideration by France or England because the partitioning did not upset the great powers of Europe.  The second partition involved Russia and Prussia taking additional land from Poland.  After the second partition, which occurred on January 21, 1792, the majority of their remaining land was lost to Prussia and Russia.  The third partition of Poland took place in October of 1795, giving Russia, Prussia, and Austria the remainder of the Polish land.  Russia ended up with 120,000 square kilometres, Austria 47,000 square kilometres, and Prussia 55,000 square kilometres.  This took Poland off of the map.

==Science and Technology==
The Enlightenment was notable for its scientific revolution, which changed the manner in which the people of Europe approached both science and technology. This was the direct result of philosophic enquiry into the ways in which science should be approached. The most important figures in this change of thinking were Descartes and Bacon.

The philosopher René Descartes presented the notion of deductive reasoning - that is, to start with a premise and to then discard evidence that doesn't support the premise.  However, Sir Francis Bacon introduced a new method of thought.  He suggested that instead of using deductive reasoning, people should use inductive reasoning - in other words, they should gather evidence and then reach a conclusion based on the evidence.  This line of thought also became known as the Scientific Method.

=== Changes in Astronomy ===
The Scientific Revolution began with discoveries in astronomy, most importantly dealing with the concept of a solar system.  These discoveries generated controversy, and some were forced by church authorities to recant their theories.

[[Image:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|100px|Aristotle]]

==== Pre-Revolution: Aristotle and Ptolemy ====
The geocentric (earth-centred) view of the universe had been taught since the days of Aristotle. Ptomely's &quot;Almagest&quot; (c.2nd century CE) was the standard text used to teach students astronomy and remained so for hundreds of years. Ptolemy's theories are a mixture of science and religion and to modern readers may come across as unusual though it must always be borne in mind that Ptolemy was building upon the works of earlier astronomers. Surprisingly a Greek philosopher called Aristarchus (310 BC - ca.230 BC) suggested that the earth moved around the sun and though this was common knowledge amongst all who studied astronomy it would be over a thousand years before he was proved right. The early christian church (c.4th century CE) adopted the Ptolemaic system since it was in accord with biblical teaching. A universe without the earth at its center would negate divine purpose and Ptolemy's idea of the spheres in harmony strengthened the creationist argument. The Enlightenment, which is also referred to as the Age of Reason, was a period when European philosophers emphasized the use of reason as the best method for learning the truth.

==== Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543)====
[[Image:Heliocentric solar system.png|thumb|200px|left|Heliocentric solar system]]During the Renaissance, study of astronomy at universities began.  [[w:Johann Müller Regiomontanus|Regiomontanus]] and [[w:Cardinal Nicolas of Cusa|Nicolas of Cusa]] developed new advances in mathematics and methods of calculation.

Copernicus, although a devout Christian, doubted whether the views held by Aristotle and Ptolemy were completely correct.  Using mathematics and visual observations with only the naked eye, he developed the [[w:Heliocentrism|Heliocentric]], or Copernican, Theory of the Universe, stating that the Earth revolves around the sun.

==== Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) ====
Tycho Brahe created a mass of scientific data on astronomy during his lifetime; although he made no major contributions to science, he laid the groundwork for Kepler's discoveries.

==== Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) ====
Kepler was a student of Brahe.  He used Brahe's body of data to write Kepler's Three Laws of Planetary Motion, most significantly noting that planets' orbits are elliptical instead of circular.

==== Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) ====
Galileo is generally given credit for invention of the telescope; although the device itself is not of Galileo's design, he was the first to use it for astronomy.  With this tool, he proved the Copernican Theory of the Universe.

Galileo spread news of his work through letters to friends and colleagues.  Although the Church forced him to recant his ideas and spend the rest of his life under house arrest, his works had already been published and could not be disregarded.

[[Image:Hw-newton.jpg|thumb|100px|Sir Isaac Newton]]

==== Isaac Newton (1642-1727) ====
Newton is often considered the greatest scientific mind in history.  His ''Principia Mathematica'' (1687) includes Newton's Law of Gravity, an incredibly ground-breaking study.  Newton's work destroyed the old notion of an Earth-centred universe.

Newton also had a great influence outside of science.  For example, he was to become the hero of Thomas Jefferson.

=== Developments in Medicine ===

==== Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) ====
Vesalius studied human cadavers, a practice forbidden by church doctrine.  His writing ''The Structure of the Human Body'' in 1543 renewed and modernized the study of the human body.

==== William Harvey (1578-1657) ====
William Harvey wrote ''On the Movement of the Heart and Blood'' in 1628, on the circulatory system. He was a doctor and an anatomist.

==Society and Culture==
As a result of new learning from the Scientific Revolution, the world was less of a mystical place, as natural phenomena became increasingly explainable by science.  According to Enlightened philosophers:
* The universe is a fully tangible place governed by natural rather than supernatural forces.
* Rigorous application of the scientific method can answer fundamental questions in all areas of inquiry.
* The human race can be educated to achieve nearly infinite improvement.

Perhaps most importantly, though, Enlightened philosophers stressed that people are all equal because all of us possess reason.

=== Precursors ===
There were a number of precursors to the Enlightenment.  One of the most important was the Age of Science of the 1600s, which presented inductive thinking, and using evidence to reach a conclusion.  The ideas of Locke and Hobbes and the notion of the social contract challenged traditional thinking and also contributed to the Enlightenment.  Scepticism, which questioned traditional authority and ideas, contributed as well.  Finally, the idea of moral relativism arose - assailing people for judging people who are different from themselves.

===The Legacy of the Enlightenment===
The Enlightenment began in France, as a result of its well-developed town and city life, as well as its large middle class that wanted to learn the ideas.  The Enlightenment promoted the use of one's reason, rather than accepting tradition.  It rejected the traditional attitudes of the Catholic Church.  Many &quot;philosophers,&quot; or people who thought about subjects in an enquiring, inductive manner, became prominent.  Salons were hosted by upper-middle class women who wanted to discuss topics of the day, such as politics.

The Enlightenment stressed that we are products of experience and environment, and that we should have the utmost confidence in the unlimited capacity of the human mind.  It stressed the unlimited progress of humans, and the ideas of atheism and deism became especially prominent.  Adam Smith's concept of free market capitalism sent European economics in a new direction.  Enlightened despots such as Catherine the Great and Joseph II replaced absolute monarchs and used their states as agents of progress.  Education and literacy expanded vastly, and people recognized the importance of intellectual freedoms of speech, thought, and press.

=== Conflict with the Church ===
Although the ideas of the Enlightenment clashed with Church dogma, it was mostly not a movement against the Church.  Most Enlightened philosophers considered themselves to be followers of deism, believing that God created an utterly flawless universe and left it alone, some describing God as the &quot;divine clockmaker.&quot;

=== Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) ===
* dies before the enlightenment
* English Revolution shapes his political outlook
* ''Leviathan'' (1651) - life is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short&quot; - people are naturally bad and need a strong government to control them.
* may be considered to be the father of the enlightenment: because of all the opposition he inspired.

[[Image:JohnLocke.jpg|thumb|100px|John Locke]]

=== John Locke (1632-1704) ===
* specifically refuted Hobbes
* humanity is only governed by laws of nature, man has right to life, liberty, and property
* there is a natural social contract that binds the people and their government together; the people have a  responsibility to their government, and their government likewise has a responsibility to its people
* ''Two Treatises on Civil Government'' justified supremacy of Parliament
* ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1690) - Tabula rasa - human progress is in the hands of society

=== Philosophers ===

====[[Wikipedia:Voltaire|Voltaire]] (1694-1776)====
* stressed religious tolerance

==== Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755) ====
* ''Spirit of the Laws'' - checks and balances on government, no one group having sole power

[[Image:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|100px|thumb|left|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]

==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) ====
* social contract
* &quot;general will&quot; - government acts for the majority

=== Rococo Art ===

[[Image:Boucher Diane sortant du bain Louvre 2712.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Diana Leaving her Bath'' by [[w:François Boucher|François Boucher]].]]

The Rococo Art movement of the 1700s emphasized elaborate, decorative, frivolous, and aristocratic art.  Often depicted were playful intrigue, love, and courtship.  The use of wispy brush strokes and pastels was common in Rococo Art.  Rococo Art is especially associated with the reign of Louis XV Bourbon in France.  The French artist Boucher painted for Madame Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV.  The most famous paintings of Boucher include ''Diana Leaving her Bath'' and ''Pastorale'', a painting of a wealthy couple under a tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The French Revolution of 1789 is one of the most important events in both French and European history. It marks the rise of the 3rd class after centuries of paying high tax to the King. The revolution centred around (at its peak) the weak King Louis XVI and the immature Queen Marie Antoinette , as the public saw them, and their lavish lifestyle hidden away at Versailles. The people of France at the time of 1789 were being influenced by the media, which did not help the situation. The press would make up stories of their &quot;Wicked Queen's&quot; lavish spending of public money, and her many love affairs which made her extremely unpopular among the French public. The 6 October 1789 marks the start of the Revolution when 100s of market women (and men dressed as women) marched on the Palace Of Versailles demanding the Queen's head and the King's immediate return to Paris. The women were successful in bringing the Royal family back to Paris, even if the queen had not been killed as intended. The situation worsened once in Paris as the &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; came to power, and as Marie Antoinette famously said &quot;Now they will make proper prisoners of us.&quot;

==Diplomatic Revolution==

The Diplomatic Revolution is a term applied to the reversal of long standing diplomatic alliances in the wake of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle which concluded the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748.  The traditional alliances of France and Prussia against Great Britain and Austria changed to France and Austria against Great Britain and Prussia.  In order to cement the alliance, Maria Theresa of Austria married her daughter, Marie Antoinette, to Louis XVI, heir to the French throne. Despite hope that this alliance would create an unbeatable power bloc in Europe, it failed to win the Seven Years' War (fought in Europe from 1758-1763, known in America as the French and Indian War), as both Austria and France failed to stop the rising power of Prussia under Frederick the Great. Furthermore, public opinion on both sides was very sceptical of this alliance, for Austria and France had traditionally been enemies since the Habsburg-Valois wars of the 16th century.

The Austrian alliance, including the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette is commonly considered one of the central causes of the French Revolution.  The Queen was widely condemned for her extravagance, extreme even for a queen, and the most quoted remark never said; when told that the peasants of France were so poor that they could not put bread on the table, she was said to have replied, &quot;let them eat cake,&quot; which supposedly &quot;proved&quot; that she was out of touch with the general populace.  Although it is unlikely that the queen ever said such a thing, it is still an example of the French citizens' opinion of their royalty, that they would create such a story. As the historian Munro Price suggests, though, much of the criticism of Marie-Antoinette came from the fact that there was no one else to blame for bad policies. Under Louis XIV and Louis XV, both of whom were prolific womanizers who had many official mistresses during their respective reigns, public opinion often leveled the blame for society's ills at the King's current ministers who, more often than not, owed their position to the royal mistress (such as the Duc de Choiseul and Madame de Pompadour in the 1750s). When there was no mistress, however, as was the case with Louis XVI, opinion turned on the Queen, who was widely perceived, and to some extent correctly, to exercise influence with the King in the choice of ministers, as had happened with the intermittent appointments of the Baron de Breteuil (a favorite of the Queen's) to the royal council.

== Neoclassicism ==

[[Image:Death of Marat by David.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Death of Marat'' by Jacques-Louis David (1793)]]

Neoclassicism is a genre of art that was prevalent mainly in the 18th and into the early 19th centuries that was based on the Greek style of decoration such as columns. Neoclassical art uses sharp colors as a replacement for more pastel colors. Neoclassicism was influenced by The Enlightenment, which took place in the 17th and 18th centuries, and was the thought of more individualization of the community. It emphasized reason rather than emotion. 

One of the more popular french artists during neoclassic age was Jacques-Louis David. He was born August 30th 1748 and died on December 29th 1825. He painted the painting call “Tennis Court Oath” in 1792 of the Tennis Court Oath during the French Revolution. During the French Revolution, he became good friends with Maximilien Robespierre, the head of the Committee of Public Safety.

== Precursors to the French Revolution ==

Countless ideas from the Enlightenment contributed to the French Revolution.  Locke's ideas of overthrowing government that does not respect the social contract, as well as Rousseau's ideas of the general will and the French government's failure to represent the general will of the people, were major factors.  The Enlightenment also stripped away at religion, especially Catholicism, directly attacking the divine right theory that Louis XVI of France used to justify his position.

Additionally, there were massive food shortages across France, there was a constant war, anger over social inequality, and a weak queen and king.  Moreover, a harsh winter had resulted in no harvest and the lack of food, especially bread, causing poverty, death, and destruction.

The immediate spark of the French Revolution, however, was the financial crisis in France.  This problem stemmed from a number of issues.  One of the most prominent of these issues was the fact that the nobles were tax-exempt, and the nobles resisted any attempt by Louis to tax them.  In addition, France had accrued massive debt from assisting in the American Revolution, as well as from the Seven Years War.  Finally, French tax collectors were corrupt.  As a result, Louis called the Estates General for assistance and advice to resolve the financial crisis.

The Estates General consisted of three estates: the first estate was made up of clergymen, the second estate was made up of nobles, and the third estate was made up of commoners, who represented at least 95% of the populace.  The third estate, angry over their disproportionate representation and their inability to act according to their needs, rebelled, and declared itself the National Assembly.  Three days later members of the third estate took the Oath of the Tennis Court, swearing allegiance to the French nation and drawing up a list of grievances (cahiers de doléances) against the king.  They aimed to democratically represent the will of the people and give the people a constitution, and they were clearly motivated by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England.

== End of a royal family  ==
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on the 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women. In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen. The mob of people forced the King And Queen to have their carriage windows wide open. At one point a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen. Despite Marie Antoinette's best efforts to please the mob in giving out bread from the carriage, it was thrown back, as the people refused to eat it as &quot;It is sure to be poisoned.&quot; 

The next four years of the Royal family’s lives were to be of misery and hope although the efforts of Queen Marie Antoinette’s Austrian family, and close friends of the King and Queen such as Count Ferson and Count Mercy, and despite one failed rescue attempt, the royal family were imprisoned. The Royal family saw the terror of the French Revolution, the Queens nephew by 1792 was now Emperor of Austria and felt no need to rescue his Aunt who he had never met before. In 1792 the crown was abolished in favour of a republic making the now former Royal family of France to be nicknamed “The carpets”. Louis Carpet, the former King, stood trial in January of 1793 and was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by Guillotine. An emotional scene followed in which the King said his goodbye to his devastated family. “And you came to France for this!” Louis exclaimed to his wife, Marie Antoinette, dressed in black upon hearing that her husband had been executed from that day on. However more sadness followed when the “Widow Carpet” Marie Antoinette’s 8 year old son Louis-Charles was to be taken away. Marie Antoinette leaped into his arms and did not let go for a full hour, despite threats to her life. It was not until they threatened to kill her Marie Therese that she let go. The boy who was hailed as King by Royalist around France and Europe was integrated and turned against his mother. The former Queen was also taken from Madam Elizabeth and her daughter, “Treat her like a second mother” Marie Antoinette told Marie Therese before departing form the tower. As Marie Antoinette was led down form the tower she hit her head on the last pillar of the staircases “Did that hurt Madam?” asked a guard “No I felt nothing” replied the former Queen drenched in black. The widow Carpet was taken to a Woman’s Prison. A man waiting a the reception was woken up by a guard (The man had worked at Versailles once as a pastry maker and instantly recognised the former Queen) “Name Please” he asked, Marie Antoinette replied blankly “Look at me”. Deprived of everything the former Queen spend days in her hot cell, reading books, making clothes for her daughter, and playing with a ring on her finger passing it on to finger to finger. Every now and then the Queen would look up when hearing of what sounded like a harp being played, reminding her of distant days long gone. The existence of the Royal family was a weak one of suffering and pain, Marie Antoinette’s sister wrote “Maybe natural death is the best fate” about Marie Antoinette. Finally in October 1793 a full 4 years into the French revolution Antoinette was trailed and found  guilty of Treason among other things. She was executed on the 16th October 1793 by Guillotine, Before leaving for her death it was rumoured she said “Now I shall take my place in hell, with my mother and two emperor brothers, and as for my fat pompous of a husband, I want nothing more to do with him”. However Marie Antoinette properly did not say this, just another public stunt form the media. Her final words were simply “sorry mousier I did not do it on purpose” after stepping on the executioners foot. Madam Elizabeth followed her brother and sister in  law foot steps to the blade a year later. Louis-Charles died alone in his cell in 1795. Marie Therese however out lived the revolution and lived until the 1850s becoming Queen of France for 20 minutes, and holding the title her mother made so iconic “Dauphine of France”. She died in Austria, places of exile (In which she spent most of her life) include, Scotland, Kent and Austria. Returning to France for a brief period of time before being forced to leave by Napoleon who said “She was the only man in her family” when Marie Therese gathered an army and refused to leave France.

== Storming of the Bastille ==

[[Image:Prise_de_la_Bastille.jpg|left|350px|thumb|The storming of the Bastille, July 14 1789]]

On July 14, 1789, the revolting Paris mob stormed the Bastille.  While only seven prisoners were housed behind its walls, none of whom could be considered political in any way, this event was essential because it symbolized that the people were no longer standing for the power of the nobles and the king, or the rising of the people against the tyranny of absolutism. The fall of the Bastille was also the first time, but certainly not the last, during the Revolution that popular mobs would rise up and take action outside of the legislature. These later risings, known in French as journees, would prove to be both extremely influential on public opinion and a cause for major hand-wringing on the part of the legislature, who did not want to risk a massive popular revolution as opposed to the controlled &quot;bourgeois&quot; revolution.



== New Governments ==

The revolutionaries in France established a new government in order to accomplish what they desired.

===National Assembly 1789-1791===

The members of the National Assembly came from the members of the third estate in the Estates General.  These members tended to be from the upper middle class, or bourgeois, and were often referred to as &quot;Jacobins&quot; since they frequently met in Jacobin clubs to discuss the revolution.

The lower third estate, or the rest of the citizenry, led the fighting arm of the revolution and the National Assembly at this time.  They did not, however, take part in the government.  The urban middle class led the storming on the Bastille and the march on Versailles.

====Efforts to Remake Society====

The National Assembly took a number of actions to remake society.  They established social equality, and signed the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, which was a social contract.  It provided for freedom of religion, taxation of equality, legal equality, and freedom of press and expression.  They wrote a constitution that established a constitutional monarchy with a parliament.  The parliament was to be run by the bourgeois, who were considered &quot;active&quot; citizens, while the rest of the citizens were considered &quot;passive&quot; citizens and would not be allowed to take part in government.  People in government were to progress based upon merit.  Finally, the National Assembly established the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790), which clergymen would eventually be required to swear an oath to in 1791. In addition to nationalizing church property, the Civil Constitution also abolished religious vows and turned all Church clerics (including monks and nuns) into civil servants who received their pay and assignments not from Rome, but from Paris. While this was initially well-received by many Frenchmen who applauded the &quot;bringing home&quot; of the church, the subsequent punitive measures taken against clergy who did not swear the oath (also known as the refractory clergy) would be a cause of great resentment in the Western provinces, and was one of the causes behind the Vendee rising in 1793.

===Legislative Assembly 1791-1792===

The provisions of the National Assembly established what was supposed to be a permanent constitutional monarchy, the Legislative Assembly, with Louis XVI as the monarch.  However, the Legislative Assembly failed very quickly for a number of reasons.  The lower third estate felt abandoned by the bourgeois politically.  In addition, the Legislative Assembly failed to fix the food and unemployment problems.  As a result, the working men of France, or the sans-culottes, rose against the Legislative Assembly.

===War with Austria and Prussia===

Emigres, or nobility that had fled France during the Revolution, in Austria wanted the Austrian government to crush the Revolution.  Other nations feared revolution in their own countries.  Austria signed the Declaration of Pillnitz (1791), which stated that if the other powers attack France, so would Austria.  The French interpreted this as a virtual declaration of war.

The Brunswick Manifesto (1792) by Prussia stated that the Prussians would punish the citizens of Paris if they did anything to harm Louis XVI or Marie Antionette.  Prussia and Austria allied for the balance of power, in order to weaken France.  The draining of war on the newly formed government also contributed to its downfall.

===Convention 1792-1795===

[[Image:Robespierre.jpg|thumb|250px|Anonymous Portrait of Maximilien de Robespierre c. 1793 ([[w:Carnavalet Museum|Carnavalet Museum]]).]]

The Convention was an emergency republic with universal male suffrage.  The leading body of the Convention was the Committee of Public Safety, who worked to suppress dissent and protect the revolution.  The Committee was composed of twelve members, of whom the dominant individual was Maximilien de Robespierre.  The leadership of the Convention split into two factions: the Montagnards (or &quot;Mountain&quot;), who was more radical and included Robespierre, and the Girondin, which was more middle class.

The Convention had a number of issues to address.  First, and perhaps most importantly, they were actively engaged in war with Prussia and Austria.  They instituted the first draft, called the ''levee en masse'', and a nationalist feeling rose among troops.  In 1794, the French army invaded Austria and was successful.

In addition, the Convention needed to remake society.  Members instituted &quot;dechristianization,&quot; which was essentially the purging of Christians in France.

The Convention also needed to address the food problem, and established the &quot;General Maximum&quot; that controlled bread prices and wages.

Finally, the Convention needed to stop the counter-revolution and write a new constitution.  During a period known as &quot;The Terror,&quot; Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety utilized the newly invented guillotine to kill tens of thousands of counter-revolutionaries.  The Convention successfully wrote a new constitution, establishing a government known as the Directory as a permanent republic.

On 27 July (&quot;9 Thermidor&quot; in the Revolutionary Calendar) 1794, Robespierre himself was arrested, and was executed the next day.  The resulting &quot;Thermidorian Reaction&quot; was a response to France's swing to the left, during which the government briefly went to the right, and finally back to the center.  The Jacobins and other Montagnards were replaced with the more moderate Girondins (Bourgeois), and many Montagnard members were executed.

===Directory 1795-1799===

The Directory was the first constitutional republic, which had an executive body of five directors, as well as a bicameral legislative body consisting of the Council of Ancients and the Council of 500.  In 1797, the first free elections were held, and the people of France astonished members of the Directory by electing a majority of royalists to the legislature.  Unwilling to risk the reversal of everything achieved since 1789, left-wing members of the legislature, combined with support from the military, purged the Directory of rightist members in the coup of 18 Fructidor, which established a dictatorship controlled by left-wing Directors. However, people grew fearful of a possible return of the Terror, thus, when Napoleon Bonaparte and Abbe Sieyes launched the coup of 18 Brumaire to end the Directory and instead establish the Consulate, there was little opposition.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Exabyte. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Exabyte~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==(W)==
(heading inserted by [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 13:28, 19 March 2009 (UTC))

There are no swedish words beginning with the letter &quot;W&quot;, actually it is not used in swedish at all. It is only in names for persons an older place-names you can find it. It should not be in the list. // [[User:Solkoll|Solkoll]] 18:21, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:It shouldn't. In a Swedish telephone catalogue list, the name of the V entry &quot;V, W&quot; could be used, since personal names can be spelled to contain W, but never in dictionaries, nor name lists of places in Sweden. The entry should be &quot;V&quot; only. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 13:28, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

== Nice list... ==
...but it lacks two fundamental things: conjugations and genders.

The list is just telling that &quot;apple&quot; is ''äpple'' but it doesn't tell that it's '''''ett''' äpple'' and that it is conjugated as ''ett äpple, äppl'''et''', äppl'''en''', äppl'''ena'''''. If you're ever going to get people to understand Swedish, you have to teach them how to conjugate all the verbs, nouns and adjectives. Conjugating is not a hard thing to grasp even for a beginner. 

Just some advice from a passer-by, I hope someone listens to me. --[[User:84.239.157.217|84.239.157.217]] 10:52, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

== Statisticallity? ==
Now, are there any principles for choosing words for the vocabulary? Or, have you ever considered asking:
:''Have you seen any &lt;u&gt;berserkers&lt;/u&gt; around lately?''
And other things:
* since verbs are weak and strong, the three standard forms, ''infinitive'', ''preterite'' and ''supinum'' should be listed, such as skriva, skrev, skrivit, or hitta, -de, -t.
* all entries should be lowercase, Sw. don't use the standard of setting the first letter of nouns uppercase.
[[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 13:41, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

:Most entries should be lowercase, in particular anything but geographical names and other names. Swedish don't use initial capital for the name of a people, so that ''Swedes'' = ''svenskar'', nor languages, so that ''Swedish'' = ''svenska''.

==Wiktionary?==
The [[German/Appendices/Vocabulary|german vocabulary]] is much better  structured regarding tutoring purposes. A straight vocabulary like this one, could better reside on Wiktionary. I propose reworking this vocabulary to look like the German one. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 14:32, 19 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

A remarkable amount of today's modern statistics comes from the original work of [[Wikipedia:Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] in the early 20th Century. Although there are a dizzying number of minor disciplines in the field, there are some basic, fundamental studies.

The beginning student of statistics will be more interested in one topic or another depending on his or her outside interest. The following is a list of some of the primary branches of statistics.

== Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics ==

Those of us who are purists and philosophers may be interested in the intersection between pure mathematics and the messy realities of the world. A rigorous study of probability — especially the probability distributions and the distribution of errors — can provide an understanding of where all these statistical procedures and equations come from. Although this sort of rigor is likely to get in the way of a psychologist (for example) learning and using statistics effectively, it is important if one wants to do serious (i.e. graduate-level) work in the field.

That being said, there is good reason for all students to have a fundamental understanding of where all these &quot;statistical techniques and equations&quot; are coming from! We're always more adept at using a tool if we can understand ''why'' we're using that tool. The challenge is getting these important ideas to the non-mathematician without the student's eyes glazing over. One can take this argument a step further to claim that a vast number of students will never actually use a t-test—he or she will never plug those numbers into a calculator and churn through some esoteric equations—but by having a fundamental understanding of such a test, he or she will be able to understand (and question) the results of someone else's findings.

== Design of Experiments ==

One of the most neglected aspects of statistics—and maybe the single greatest reason that Statisticians drink—is Experimental Design. So often a scientist will bring the results of an important experiment to a statistician and ask for help analyzing results only to find that a flaw in the experimental design rendered the results useless. So often we statisticians have researchers come to us hoping that we will somehow magically &quot;rescue&quot; their experiments.

A friend provided me with a classic example of this. In his psychology class he was required to conduct an experiment and summarize its results. He decided to study whether music had an impact on problem solving. He had a large number of subjects (myself included) solve a puzzle first in silence, then while listening to classical music and finally listening to rock and roll, and finally in silence. He measured how long it would take to complete each of the tasks and then summarized the results.

What my friend failed to consider was that the results were highly impacted by a ''learning effect'' he hadn't considered. The first puzzle always took longer because the subjects were first learning how to work the puzzle. By the third try (when subjected to rock and roll) the subjects were much more adept at solving the puzzle, thus the results of the experiment would seem to suggest that people were much better at solving problems while listening to rock and roll!

The simple act of randomizing the order of the tests would have isolated the &quot;learning effect&quot; and in fact, a well-designed experiment would have allowed him to measure both the effects of each type of music ''and'' the effect of learning. Instead, his results were meaningless. A careful experimental design can help preserve the results of an experiment, and in fact some designs can save huge amounts of time and money, maximize the results of an experiment, and sometimes yield additional information the researcher had never even considered!

== Sampling ==

Similar to the Design of Experiments, the study of sampling allows us to find a most effective statistical design that will optimize the amount of information we can collect while minimizing the level of effort. Sampling is very different from experimental design however. In a laboratory we can design an experiment and control it from start to finish. But often we want to study something outside of the laboratory, over which we have much less control.

If we wanted to measure the population of some harmful beetle and its effect on trees, we would be forced to travel into some forest land and make observations, for example: measuring the population of the beetles in different locations, noting which trees they were infesting, measuring the health and size of these trees, etc.

Sampling design gets involved in questions like &quot;How many measurements do I have to take?&quot; or &quot;How do I select the locations from which I take my measurements?&quot; Without planning for these issues, researchers might spend a lot of time and money only to discover that they really have to sample ten times as many points to get meaningful results or that some of their sample points were in some landscape (like a marsh) where the beetles thrived more or the trees grew better.

== Modern Regression ==

Regression models relate variables to each other in a linear fashion. For example, if you recorded the heights and weights of several people and plotted them against each other, you would find that as height increases, weight tends to increase too. You would probably also see that a straight line through the data is about as good a way of approximating the relationship as you will be able to find, though there will be some variability about the line. Such linear models are possibly the most important tool available to statisticians. They have a long history and many of the more detailed theoretical aspects were discovered in the 1970s. The usual method for fitting such models is by &quot;least squares&quot; estimation, though other methods are available and are often more appropriate, especially when the data are not normally distributed.

What happens, though, if the relationship is not a straight line? How can a curve be fit to the data? There are many answers to this question. One simple solution is to fit a quadratic relationship, but in practice such a curve is often not flexible enough. Also, what if you have many variables and relationships between them are dissimilar and complicated?

Modern regression methods aim at addressing these problems. Methods such as generalized additive models, projection pursuit regression, neural networks and boosting allow for very general relationships between explanatory variables and response variables, and modern computing power makes these methods a practical
option for many applications

== Classification ==

Some things are different from others. How? That is, how are objects classified into their respective groups? Consider a bank that is hoping to lend money to customers. Some customers who borrow money will be unable or unwilling to pay it back, though most will
pay it back as regular repayments. How is the bank to classify customers into these two groups when deciding which ones to lend money to?

The answer to this question no doubt is influenced by many things, including a customer's income, credit history, assets, already existing debt, age and profession. There may be other influential, measurable characteristics that can be used to predict what kind of customer a particular individual is. How should the bank decide which characteristics are important, and how should it combine this information into a rule that tells it whether or not to lend the money?

This is an example of a classification problem, and statistical classification is a large field containing methods such as linear discriminant analysis, classification trees, neural networks and other methods.

== Time Series ==

Many types of research look at data that are gathered over time, where an observation taken today may have some correlation with the observation taken tomorrow. Two prominent examples of this are the fields of finance (the stock market) and atmospheric science. 

We've all seen those line graphs of stock prices as they meander up and down over time. Investors are interested in predicting which stocks are likely to keep climbing (i.e. when to buy) and when a stock in their portfolio is falling. It is easy to be misled by a sudden jolt of good news or a simple &quot;market correction&quot; into inferring—incorrectly—that one or the other is taking place!

In meteorology scientists are concerned with the venerable science of predicting the weather. Whether trying to predict if tomorrow will be sunny or determining whether we are experiencing true climate changes (i.e. global warming) it is important to analyze weather data over time.

== Survival Analysis ==

Suppose that a pharmaceutical company is studying a new drug which it is hoped will cause people to live longer (whether by curing them of cancer, reducing their blood pressure or cholesterol and thereby their risk of heart disease, or by some other mechanism). The company will recruit patients into a clinical trial, give some patients the drug and others a placebo, and follow them until they have amassed enough data to answer the question of whether, and by how long, the new drug extends life expectancy. 

Such data present problems for analysis. Some patients will have died earlier than others, and often some patients will not have died before the clinical trial completes. Clearly, patients who live longer contribute informative data about the ability (or not) of the drug to extend life expectancy. So how should such data be analyzed?

Survival analysis provides answers to this question and gives statisticians the tools necessary to make full use of the available data to correctly interpret the treatment effect.

== Categorical Analysis ==

In laboratories we can measure the weight of fruit that a plant bears, or the temperature of a chemical reaction. These data points are easily measured with a yardstick or a thermometer, but what about the color of a person's eyes or her attitudes regarding the taste of broccoli? Psychologists can't measure someone's anger with a measuring stick, but they can ask their patients if they feel &quot;very angry&quot; or &quot;a little angry&quot; or &quot;indifferent&quot;. Entirely different methodologies must be used in statistical analysis from these sorts of experiments. Categorical Analysis is used in a myriad of places, from political polls to analysis of census data to genetics and medicine.

== Clinical Trials ==

In the United States, the [[Wikipedia:FDA|FDA]] requires that pharmaceutical companies undergo rigorous procedures called [[Wikipedia:Clinical Trials|Clinical Trials]] and statistical analyses to assure public safety before allowing the sale of use of new drugs. In fact, the pharmaceutical industry employs more statisticians than any other business!

== Summary Statistics ==

The most simple example of statistics &quot;in practice&quot; is in the generation of summary statistics. Let us consider the example where we are interested in the weight of eighth graders in a school. (Maybe we're looking at the growing epidemic of child obesity in America!) Our school has 200 eighth graders, so we gather all their weights. What we have are 200 positive real numbers.

If an administrator asked you what the weight was of this eighth grade class, you wouldn't grab your list and start reading off all the individual weights; it's just too much information. That same administrator wouldn't learn anything except that she shouldn't ask you any questions in the future! What you want to do is to distill the information — these 200 numbers — into something concise.

What might we express about these 200 numbers that would be of interest? The most obvious thing to do is to calculate the average or ''mean'' value so we know how much the &quot;typical eighth grader&quot; in the school weighs. It would also be useful to express how much this number varies; after all, eighth graders come in a ''wide variety'' of shapes and sizes! In reality, we can probably reduce this set of 200 weights into at most four or five numbers that give us a firm comprehension of the data set.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Statistics/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Where the [[Statistics/Distributions/Bernoulli|Bernoulli Distribution]] asks the question of &quot;Will this single event succeed?&quot; the Binomial is associated with the question &quot;Out of a given number of trials, how many will succeed?&quot; Some example questions that are modeled with a Binomial distribution are:

* Out of ten tosses, how many times will this coin land ''heads''?
* From the children born in a given hospital on a given day, how many of them will be girls?
* How many students in a given classroom will have green eyes?
* How many mosquitos, out of a swarm, will die when sprayed with insecticide?

The relation between the Bernoulli and binomial distributions is intuitive: The binomial distribution is composed of multiple Bernoulli trials. We conduct &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; repeated experiments where the probability of success is given by the parameter &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and add up the number of successes. This number of successes is represented by the random variable X. The value of X is then between 0 and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

When a random variable X has a binomial distribution with parameters &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we write it as X ~ Bin(n,p) or X ~ B(n,p) and the probability mass function is given by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; P\left[X = k\right] = \begin{cases} {n \choose k} p^k \left(1-p\right)^{n-k}\ &amp; 0 \le k \le n \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases} \quad 0 \leq p \leq 1, \quad n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;

For a refresher on factorials (''n''!), go back to the [[Statistics/Introduction/Need_To_Know#Factorials|Refresher Course]] earlier in this wiki book.

==== An example ====

Let's walk through a simple example of the binomial distribution. We're going to use some pretty small numbers because factorials can be hard to compute. We are going to ask five random people if they believe there is life on other planets. We are going to assume in this example that we know 30% of people believe this to be true. We want to ask the question: &quot;How many people will say they believe in extraterrestrial life?&quot; Actually, we want to be more specific than that: &lt;b&gt;&quot;What is the probability that exactly 2 people will say they believe in extraterrestrial life?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;

We know all the values that we need to plug into the equation. The number of people asked, n=5. The probability of any given person answering &quot;yes&quot;, p=0.3. (Remember, I said that 30% of people believe in life on other planets!) Finally, we're asking for the probability that exactly 2 people answer &quot;yes&quot; so k=2. This yields the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; P \left[X = 2 \right] = {5 \choose 2} \cdot {{0.3^2 \cdot} {\left( 1 - 0.3 \right)^{3}}} = {10} \cdot {{0.3^2} \cdot {\left( 1-0.3 \right)^{3}}} = 0.3087&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;{5 \choose 2}={5! \over 2! \cdot 3!}={5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \over (2 \cdot 1) \cdot (3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1)}={120 \over 12}=10&lt;/math&gt;

Here are the probabilities for all the possible values of X. You can get these values by replacing the k=2 in the above equation with all values from 0 to 5.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Value for k || Probability f(k)
|-
| 0 || 0.16807
|-
| 1 || 0.36015
|-
| 2 || 0.30870
|-
| 3 || 0.13230
|-
| 4 || 0.02835
|-
| 5 || 0.00243
|}

What can we learn from these results? Well, first of all we'll see that it's just a little more likely that only one person will confess to believing in life on other planets. There's a distinct chance (about 17%) that nobody will believe it, and there's only a 0.24% (a little over 2 in 1000) that all five people will be believers.

====Explanation of the equation====

Take the above example. Let's consider each of the five people one by one.

The probability that any one person believes in extraterrestrial life is 30%, or 0.3. So the probability that any two people both believe in extraterrestrial life is 0.3 squared. Similarly, the probability that any one person does not believe in extraterrestrial life is 70%, or 0.7, so the probability that any three people do not believe in extraterrestrial life is 0.7 cubed.

Now, for two out of five people to believe in extraterrestrial life, two conditions must be satisfied: two people believe in extraterrestrial life, and three do not. The probability of two out of five people believing in extraterrestrial life would thus appear to be 0.3 squared (two believers) times 0.7 cubed (three non-believers), or 0.03087.

However, in doing this, we are only considering the case whereby the first two selected people are believers. How do we consider cases such as that in which the third and fifth people are believers, which would also mean a total of two believers out of five?

The answer lies in combinatorics. Bearing in mind that the probability that the first two out of five people believe in extraterrestrial life is 0.03087, we note that there are C(5,2), or 10, ways of selecting a set of two people from out of a set of five, i.e. there are ten ways of considering two people out of the five to be the &quot;first two&quot;. This is why we multiply by C(n,k). The probability of having any two of the five people be believers is ten times 0.03087, or 0.3087.

====Mean====
The mean can be derived as follow.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x_i = \sum_{x=0}^n {n \choose x} p^x \left(1-p\right)^{n-x} \cdot x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_{x=0}^n {n! \over x!(n-x)!} p^x \left(1-p\right)^{n-x} x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {n! \over 0!(n-0)!} p^0 \left(1-p\right)^{n-0} \cdot 0 + \sum_{x=1}^n {n! \over x!(n-x)!} p^x \left(1-p\right)^{n-x} x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = 0 + \sum_{x=1}^n {n(n-1)! \over x(x-1)!(n-x)!} p \cdot p^{x-1} \left(1-p\right)^{n-x} x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = np\sum_{x=1}^n {(n-1)! \over (x-1)!(n-x)!} p^{x-1} \left(1-p\right)^{n-x}&lt;/math&gt;
Now let ''w=x-1'' and ''m=n-1''. We see that ''m-w=n-x''. We can now rewrite the summation as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = np \left[\sum_{w=0}^m {m! \over w!(m-w)!} p^{w} \left(1-p\right)^{m-w}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
We now see that the summation is the sum over the complete pmf of a binomial random variable distributed Bin(m, p). This is equal to 1 (and can be easily verified using the [[w:Binomial theorem|Binomial theorem]]). Therefore, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = np \left[1\right]=np&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====

We derive the variance using the following formula:
&lt;!-- this should be shown, but earlier, not here--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\operatorname{E}[X])^2.&lt;/math&gt;

We have already calculated E[''X''] above, so now we will calculate E[''X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''] and then return to this variance formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x^2

= \sum_{x=0}^n x^2 \cdot {n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can use our experience gained above in deriving the mean. We use the same definitions of ''m'' and ''w''.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_{x=0}^n {n! \over x!(n-x)!} p^x \left(1-p\right)^{n-x} x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = 0 + \sum_{x=1}^n {n! \over x!(n-x)!} p^x \left(1-p\right)^{n-x} x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = np\sum_{x=1}^n {(n-1)! \over (x-1)!(n-x)!} p^{x-1} \left(1-p\right)^{n-x}x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = np \sum_{w=0}^m {m\choose w} p^{w} \left(1-p\right)^{m-w}(w+1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = np \left[\sum_{w=0}^m {m\choose w} p^{w} \left(1-p\right)^{m-w}w+\sum_{w=0}^m {m\choose w} p^{w} \left(1-p\right)^{m-w} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

The first sum is identical in form to the one we calculated in the Mean (above). It sums to ''mp''.
The second sum is 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = np \cdot ( mp + 1) = np((n-1)p + 1) = np(np - p + 1).&lt;/math&gt;

Using this result in the expression for the variance, along with the Mean (E(''X'') = ''np''), we get

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\operatorname{E}[X])^2 = np(np - p + 1) - (np)^2 = np(1-p).&lt;/math&gt;

There is no more basic random event than the flipping of a coin. Heads or tails. It's as simple as you can get! The &quot;[[Wikipedia:Bernoulli Trial|Bernoulli Trial]]&quot; refers to a single event which can have one of two possible outcomes with a fixed probability of each occurring. You can describe these events as &quot;yes or no&quot; questions. For example:

* Will the coin land ''heads''?
* Will the newborn child be a girl?
* Are a random person's eyes green?
* Will a mosquito die after the area was sprayed with insecticide?
* Will a potential customer decide to buy my product?
* Will a citizen vote for a specific candidate?
* Is an employee going to vote pro-union?
* Will this person be abducted by aliens in their lifetime?

The Bernoulli Distribution has one controlling parameter: the probability of success. A &quot;fair coin&quot; or an experiment where success and failure are equally likely will have a probability of 0.5 (50%). Typically the variable ''p'' is used to represent this parameter.

If a random variable ''X'' is distributed with a Bernoulli Distribution with a parameter p we write its [[Wikipedia:probability mass function|probability mass function]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}p, &amp; \mbox{if } x = 1\\1-p, &amp; \mbox{if } x = 0\end{cases}\quad 0\leq p \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

Where the event ''X=1'' represents the &quot;yes.&quot;

This distribution may seem trivial, but it is still a very important building block in probability.  The Binomial distribution extends the Bernoulli distribution to encompass multiple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; cases with a fixed probability. Take a close look at the examples cited above. Some similar questions will be presented in the next section which might give an understanding of how these distributions are related.

====Mean====
The mean (E[X]) can be derived:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x_i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]  = p \cdot 1 + (1-p) \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]= p \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}[(X-\operatorname{E}[X])^2] = \sum_i f(x_i)  \cdot (x_i - \operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)= p \cdot (1-p)^2 + (1-p) \cdot (0-p)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)= [p(1-p) + p^2](1-p) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)= p(1-p) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Any French speaker will notice that &quot;Poisson&quot; means &quot;fish&quot;, but really there's nothing fishy about this distribution. It's actually pretty straightforward. The name comes from the mathematician [[Wikipedia:Simeon_Poisson|Siméon-Denis Poisson]] (1781-1840).

The Poisson Distribution is ''very similar'' to the [[Statistics/Distributions/Binomial|Binomial Distribution]]. We are examining the number of times an event happens. The difference is subtle. Whereas the Binomial Distribution looks at how many times we register a success over a fixed total number of trials, the Poisson Distribution measures how many times a discrete event occurs, over a period of continuous space or time. There isn't a &quot;total&quot; value n. As with the previous sections, let's examine a couple of experiments or questions that might have an underlying Poisson nature.

* How many pennies will I encounter on my walk home?
* How many children will be delivered at the hospital today?
* How many mosquito bites did you get today after having sprayed with insecticide?
* How many angry phone calls did I get after airing a particularly distasteful political ad?
* How many products will I sell after airing a new television commercial?
* How many people, per hour, will cross a picket line into my store?
* How many alien abduction reports will be filed this year?
* How many defects will there be per 100 metres of rope sold?

What's a little different about this distribution is that the random variable X which counts the number of events can take on &lt;i&gt;any non-negative integer&lt;/i&gt; value. In other words, I could walk home and find no pennies on the street. I could also find one penny. It's also possible (although unlikely, short of an armored-car exploding nearby) that I would find 10 or 100 or 10,000 pennies.

Instead of having a parameter p that represents a component probability like in the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions, this time we have the parameter &quot;lambda&quot; or λ which represents the &quot;average or expected&quot; number of events to happen within our experiment. The probability mass function of the Poisson is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P(N=k)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== An example ====

We run a restaurant and our signature dish (which is very expensive) gets ordered &lt;i&gt;on average&lt;/i&gt; 4 times per day. What is the probability of having this dish ordered exactly 3 times tomorrow? If we only have the ingredients to prepare 3 of these dishes, what is the probability that it will get sold out and we'll have to turn some orders away?

The probability of having the dish ordered 3 times exactly is given if we set k=3 in the above equation. Remember that we've already determined that we sell &lt;i&gt;on average&lt;/i&gt; 4 dishes per day, so λ=4.

:&lt;math&gt;P(N=k)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!} = \frac{e^{-4} 4^3}{3!} = 0.195&lt;/math&gt;

Here's a table of the probabilities for all values from k=0..6:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Value for k || Probability f(k)
|-
| 0 || 0.0183
|-
| 1 || 0.0733
|-
| 2 || 0.1465
|-
| 3 || 0.1954
|-
| 4 || 0.1954
|-
| 5 || 0.1563
|-
| 6 || 0.1042
|}

Now for the big question: Will we run out of food by the end of the day tomorrow? In other words, we're asking if the random variable X&gt;3. In order to compute this we would have to add the probabilities that X=4, X=5, X=6,... all the way to infinity! But wait, there's a better way!

The probability that we run out of food P(X&gt;3) is the same as 1 minus the probability that we ''don't'' run out of food, or 1-P(X≤3). So if we total the probability that we sell zero, one, two and three dishes and subtract that from 1, we'll have our answer. So,

: 1 - P(X≤3) = 1 - ( P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) ) = 1 - 0.4335 = 0.5665

In other words, we have a 56.65% chance of selling out of our wonderful signature dish. I guess crossing our fingers is in order!

====Mean====
We calculate the mean as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x_i = \sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^0}{0!}\cdot 0 + \sum^{\infin}_{x=1} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = 0 + e^{-\lambda} \sum^{\infin}_{x=1} \frac{\lambda \lambda^{x-1}}{(x-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \lambda e^{-\lambda}\sum^{\infin}_{x=1} \frac{\lambda^{x-1}}{(x-1)!}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \lambda e^{-\lambda}\sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}&lt;/math&gt;
[[w:Taylor_series#List_of_Maclaurin_series_of_some_common_functions|Remember]] that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{e}^{\lambda} = \sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \lambda e^{-\lambda}e^{\lambda}=\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====
We derive the variance using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = \operatorname{E}[X^2] - (\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;

We have already calculated E[''X''] above, so now we will calculate E[''X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''] and then return to this variance formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum_i f(x_i) \cdot x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = 0+\sum^{\infin}_{x=1} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda \lambda^{x-1}}{(x-1)!}x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \lambda\sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}(x+1)&lt;/math&gt; ......replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \lambda\left[\sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}x+\sum^{\infin}_{x=0} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
The first sum is E[''X'']=λ and the second we also calculated above to be 1.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2] = \lambda\left[\lambda+1\right]=\lambda^2+\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
Returning to the variance formula we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[X] = (\lambda^2+\lambda) - (\lambda)^2=\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Management Strategy is about determining '''where''' you want an organization to go and '''how''' you want it to get there. Activities that fall into the category of strategy affect a significant portion of the organization for a considerable time, distinguished from tactics which are activities in response to particular situations and are unlikely to ruin the organization if they fail.

There are competing theories as to how to determine what goals and actions are required. All of them boil down to analyzing the current situation, developing goals and a plan of action, and then driving towards those goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tamil''' is the oldest of Dravidian languages. Along with Chinese, Greek, Sanskrit and others, it is  one of the world's classical languages. Tamil literature spans 3500 years. This language was the first to develop a distinct prose form of writing among the classical languages of the world.  Tamil is  the only language among the old languages that has a history of 2000 or more years of existance.  With slight variation in scripts and usage, the language still thrives.  The literatures written in 200 BC are still learnt and used in normal speeches. The Tamil ''Thirukkural'' is second only to the Bible in number of published translations. Over the course of the language's development, many words from other languages have been absorbed. For instance, Tamil spoken in Tamil Nadu has a significant number of words from Sanskrit, English, Dutch, French and Urdu.    

The letter 'ழ' of 'தமிழ்' (Tamil) is pronounced like a retroflex 'r', and is often transliterated as &quot;zh&quot;.

Local usages of Tamil vary.  There are differences in its usage not only among countries but even within [[w:Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]], a region of India where Tamil is the predominantly spoken language.

Tamil is one of the recognized languages for official correspondence in four countries viz, India, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia. In both Canada and Myanmar, the Tamil speaking population is about one million. There are about 80 million Tamil speakers worldwide.

Tamil is a Dravidian language, like most south Indian languages. Other Dravidian languages include Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Tulu.

==History==
Tamil's origins are independent of [[w:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] (which is from the [[w:Indo-European language|Indo-European language]] family and the ancestor of many Indian languages), but it has been flexible in allowing other languages to blend in seamlessly giving the non-speaker a sense of ease while trying to learn the language. This is one of the specialties of the language since it does not modify the structural integrity of the language. The oldest Tamil text [[w:Tolkaappiyam|Tolkaappiyam]] is a grammar of Tamil.

Quite significantly for its age, Tamil seems to have undergone minimal changes and adaptations over the years. Classical Tamil is quite comprehensible to speakers of the modern language. The ancient Tamil book [[w:Tirukkural|Tirukkural]] is an example. The verses from the book are often taught to young students of the language at the primary level, and they pick up the lines in the ancient dialect with little difficulty.

==Tamil Literature==
'''Tamil literature''' is [[w:Literature|literature]] in the [[w:Tamil language|Tamil language]] which most prominently includes the contributions of the historic Tamil country or Tamizhagam, a large part of which constitutes the modern state of [[w:Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]] in [[w:India|India]]. Because of the antiquity of the Tamil language, Tamil literature has a rich tradition spanning more than 5000 years and is particularly famous for its poetic tradition as well as for its epics, philosophical works and secular flavour.  

The works of the [[w:Sangam|Sangam]] period, known as Sangam literature, at the turn of the first millennium are the most ancient and considered very important. The word Sangam refers to an academy. [[w:Tolkaappiyam|Tolkaappiyam]], Akananaru and Purananaru are important works from this period.

In the post-Sangam period, there were many notable works. [[w:Silapadhigaaram|Silapadhigaaram]] by Ilangovadigal tells the tale of Kannagi, Kovalan and Maadhavi. [[w:Thirukkural|Thirukkural]] by Thiruvalluvar consists of 1330 couplets which discuss about various aspects of life and is widely known even today. [[w:Aathichoodi|Aathichoodi]], a collection of single-line sayings was written by Auvaiyaar, a young poetess who became prematurely old according to folklore. The first word in each saying is based on alphabetical order. Kambaramayanam was a version of the [[w:Ramayana|Ramayana]] by the poet Kamban ([[w:Kambar|Kambar]]). Periya puranaam , Divya Prabhandham ,Thiruppavai, Thiruvempaavai and Dhevaaram were written in the [[w:Bhakti|Bhakti]] cult. Manimegalai, Seevaga sindhamani, Valayaapathi, Kundalakesi are other important works.

In the modern period, the works of poet [[w:Subramanya Bharathy|Subramanya Bharathy]], (better known as Bharathiar) who was also a great freedom fighter, are particularly stimulating in their progressive themes- emancipation of women, freedom, etc., 

As far as modern fiction is concerned, Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram was the first novel in Tamil.

In the early twentieth century, [[w:Kalki Krishnamurthy|Kalki Krishnamurthy]] is one of the most renowned and respected writers. [[w:Sivagamiyin Sabhadham|Sivagamiyin Sabhadham]] and [[w:Ponniyin Selvan|Ponniyin Selvan]] constitute some of his greatest works, both based on historical themes.

Some famous contemporary writers include [[w:Pudhumaipiththan|Pudhumaipiththan]], [[w:Jayakanthan|Jayakanthan]], [[w:Thi. Janakiraman|Thi. Janakiraman]], [[w:La.Sa.Ramamrutham|La.Sa.Ramamrutham]], [[w:Sujatha|Sujatha]], [[w:Jayamohan|Jayamohan]], and [[w:S.Ramakrishnan|S.Ramakrishnan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Tamil alphabet''' has 12. [[w:vowel|vowel]]s and 18 [[w:consonant|consonant]]s. These combine to form 216 compound characters. There is one special character (Aaytha ezutthu), giving a total of 247 characters.

The vowels are divided into short and long (five of each type) and two [[w:diphthong|dipthongs]].  The consonants are classified into three categories with 6 in each category: ''vallinam'' - hard, ''mellinam'' - soft or [[w:nasal|nasal]], and ''idayinam'' - medium. Unlike [[w:Devanagari|Devanagari]], Tamil has neither conjunct consonants nor  aspirated and voiced [[w:stop consonant|stops]]. Some scholars have suggested that in ''Sentamil'' (which refers to Tamil as it existed before [[w:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] words were borrowed), stops were voiceless when at the start of a word and unvoiced otherwise. However, no such distinction is observed by modern Tamil speakers.

The script is sometimes called ''Vattezhuthu'', literally &quot;round writing&quot;. This characterstic has partly to do with the fact that in ancient times, writing involved carving with a sharp point on palm leaves (''olaichuvadi'') and it was apparently easier to produce curves than straight lines by this method. The script is syllabic, in the sense that each letter is a [[w:syllable|syllable]]. However, the signs for the syllables are derived from that of the inherent consonant; thus it is of the [[w:abugida|abugida]] type. Some syllables are written by modifying the shape of the consonant in a way that is inherent to the vowel, others are written by adding vowel-inherent suffix to the consonant, yet others a prefix, and finally some vowels require adding both a prefix and a suffix to the consonant. In every case the vowel symbol is different from the vowel standing alone. An overdot (see image) - equivalent to [[w:Devanagari|Devanagari]] sign [[w:virama|virama]] -  suppresses the inherent trailing ''a'' sound of the consonant sign - that is, it is a pure consonant.

There are some lexical rules for formation of words. Some examples: a word cannot end in certain consonants, and cannot begin with some consonants including 'r' 'l' and 'll'; there are two consonants for the dental 'n' - which one should be used depends on whether the 'n' occurs at the start of the word and on the letters around it.

==The Tamil letters==

===Basic Consonants===

Consonants are also called the 'body' letters.

| &amp;#xBA9; || nnna ||  mellinam

===Borrowed consonants===

Also called [[w:Grantha|Grantha]] letters, these are used exclusively for writing words borrowed from Sanskrit, English, and other languages. Of course, not all such words include these letters.

===Vowels===

Vowels are also called the 'life' or 'soul' letters. Together with the consonants (which are called 'body' letters, they form compond, syllabic ([[w:abugida|abugida]]) letters that are called 'living' letters (ie. letters that have both 'body' and 'soul').

Special letter &amp;#2947; (pronounced 'akh') is rarely used by itself - normally serves purely grammatical function as independent vowel form of the dot on consonants that suppresses the inherent 'a' sound in plain consonants.

The long ('nedil') vowels are about twice as long as the short ('kuRil') vowels. The diphthongs are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as the short vowels, though some grammatical texts place them with the long ('nedil') vowels.

As can be seen in the compound form, the vowel sign can be added to the right, left or both sides of the consonants. It
can also form a ligature. These rules are evolving and older use has more ligatures than modern use. What you actually
see on this page depends on your font selection. 'Code 2000' will show more ligatures than 'Latha'. 

There are proponents of script reform who want to eliminate all ligatures and let all vowel signs appear on the right side.

Unicode encodes the character in logical order (always the consonant first), wheras legacy 8-bit encodings (like [[w:TSCII|TSCII]])
prefer the written order. This is a problem in transcoding these.

== Carnatic Music ==

Tamil letters are also used to indicate the notes of [[w:Carnatic music|Carnatic music]].
The notes are:

{|
|-
! Note
&lt;th&gt;Sound 
! Full Name
&lt;th&gt;Pronunciation 
! Value and Comments
|-
| &amp;#3000; || sa
| &amp;#2999;&amp;#2975;&amp;#3021;&amp;#2972;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| Shadjam
| First note, only one possible value. Sometimes referred to as the 'mother' note - all [[w:Raga|Raga]]s have this note.
|-
| &amp;#2992;&amp;#3007; || ri
| &amp;#2992;&amp;#3007;&amp;#2999;&amp;#2986;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| Rishabam || Second note, three possible values.
|-
| &amp;#2965; || ga
| &amp;#2965;&amp;#3006;&amp;#2984;&amp;#3021;&amp;#2980;&amp;#3006;&amp;#2992;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| G&amp;#257;ndh&amp;#257;ram
| Third note, three possible values (one of which coindices with the third ''ri'').
|-
| &amp;#2990; || ma
| &amp;#2990;&amp;#2980;&amp;#3021;&amp;#2991;&amp;#2990;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| Madhyamam || Fourth note, two possible values.
|-
| &amp;#2986; || pa
| &amp;#2986;&amp;#2974;&amp;#3021;&amp;#2970;&amp;#2986;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| Panchamam
| Fifth note, only one possible value. Sometimes referred to as the 'father', though not all ragas have this note.
|-
| &amp;#2980; || dha
| &amp;#2980;&amp;#3016;&amp;#2997;&amp;#2980;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| Dhaivatham || Sixth note, three possible values.
|-
| &amp;#2984;&amp;#3007; || ni
| &amp;#2984;&amp;#3007;&amp;#2999;&amp;#3006;&amp;#2980;&amp;#2990;&amp;#3021;
| Nish&amp;#257;dam
| Seventh note, three possible values (one of which coincides with the third ''dha'').
|}

The 'values' of the note here can be taken to mean semitones. There is some overlap between the possible values - this eventually leads to the octave containing 12 semitones, as in Western music. See [[w:Carnatic music|Carnatic music]] for a more complete discussion of this.

One can see from the names of the notes that they are borrowed from Sanskrit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==
Tamil's origins are independent of [[w:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] (which is from the [[w:Indo-European language|Indo-European language]] family and the ancestor of many Indian languages), but it has borrowed a number of words from Sanskrit in recent centuries. The oldest Tamil text [[w:Tolkaappiyam|Tolkaappiyam]] is a grammar of Tamil.

Quite significantly for its age, Tamil seems to have undergone minimal changes and adaptations over the years. Classical Tamil is quite comprehensible to speakers of the modern language. The ancient Tamil book [[w:Tirukkural|Tirukkural]] is an example. The verses from the book are often taught to young students of the language at the primary level, and they pick up the lines in the ancient dialect with little difficulty.{{Citation needed}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tamil literature''' is [[w:Literature|literature]] in the [[w:Tamil language|Tamil language]] which most prominently includes the contributions of the historic Tamil country or Tamizhagam, a large part of which constitutes the modern state of [[w:Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]] in [[w:India|India]]. Because of the antiquity of the Tamil language, Tamil literature has a rich tradition spanning more than 5000 years and is particularly famous for its poetic tradition as well as for its epics, philosophical works and secular flavour.  

The works of the [[w:Sangam|Sangam]] period, known as Sangam literature, at the turn of the first millennium are the most ancient and considered very important. The word Sangam refers to an academy. [[w:Tolkaappiyam|Tolkaappiyam]], Akananaru and Purananaru are important works from this period.

In the post-Sangam period, there were many notable works. [[w:Silapadhigaaram|Silapadhigaaram]] by Ilangovadigal tells the tale of Kannagi, Kovalan and Maadhavi. [[w:Thirukkural|Thirukkural]] by Thiruvalluvar consists of 1330 couplets which discuss about various aspects of life and is widely known even today. [[w:Aathichoodi|Aathichoodi]], a collection of single-line sayings was written by Auvaiyaar, a young poetess who became prematurely old according to folklore. The first word in each saying is based on alphabetical order. Kambaramayanam was a version of the [[w:Ramayana|Ramayana]] by the poet Kamban ([[w:Kambar|Kambar]]). Periya puranaam , Divya Prabhandham ,Thiruppavai, Thiruvempaavai and Dhevaaram were written in the [[w:Bhakti|Bhakti]] cult. Manimegalai, Seevaga sindhamani, Valayaapathi, Kundalakesi are other important works.

In the modern period, the works of poet [[w:Subramanya Bharathy|Subramanya Bharathy]], (better known as Bharathiar) who was also a great freedom fighter, are particularly stimulating in their progressive themes- emancipation of women, freedom, etc., 

As far as modern fiction is concerned, Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram was the first novel in Tamil.

In the early twentieth century, [[w:Kalki Krishnamurthy|Kalki Krishnamurthy]] is one of the most renowned and respected writers. [[w:Sivagamiyin Sabhadham|Sivagamiyin Sabhadham]] and [[w:Ponniyin Selvan|Ponniyin Selvan]] constitute some of his greatest works, both based on historical themes.

Some famous contemporary writers include [[w:Pudhumaipiththan|Pudhumaipiththan]], [[w:Jayakanthan|Jayakanthan]], [[w:Thi. Janakiraman|Thi. Janakiraman]], [[w:La.Sa.Ramamrutham|La.Sa.Ramamrutham]], [[w:Sujatha|Sujatha]], [[w:Jayamohan|Jayamohan]], and [[w:S.Ramakrishnan|S.Ramakrishnan]].

&lt;p&gt;Biological changes that should happen so a cell becomes cancerous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proliferate independently of growth signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;circumvent programmed cell death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replicate indefenitely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;induce vascular formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invade tissues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;toc1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer Related Genes!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of such gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumor suppressor genes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function = restrain cell proliferation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oncogenes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oncogene is a gene whose protein produt contributes to the development and or progression of CANCER.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If activated by mutation or amputation ==&amp;gt; They have &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;transforming properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA mismatch repair genes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encode for proteins that correct errors that normally occur during DNA replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toc2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tumour suppressor genes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that may result in cancerous tumors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PTCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On chromosome 9q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein patched homolog 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A member of the patched gene family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tumor suppressor gene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receptor for sonic hedgehog
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Molecule responsible in the formation of embryonic structures and in tumorigenesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevoid basal cell carcinoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esophageal SCC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bladder TCC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gorlin syndrome (with a midline cleft lip)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medulloblastoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;p53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the name come from?!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On some form of electrophoresis it is weighted 53 kilo-daltone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chromosome 17p
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;codone 72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein 53 or tumor protein 53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulates the cell cycle and, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor that is involved in preventing cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;the guardian of the genome&amp;quot; because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anticancer function
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role genomic stability, and inhibition of angiogenesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After DNA damage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate DNA repair proteins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Induce growth arrest by holding the cell cycle at the G1/S regulation point
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it holds the cell here for long enough, the DNA repair proteins will have time to fix the damage and the cell will be allowed to continue the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initiation of apoptosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p53 negative regulator is MDM2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common in Lung Ca
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NSCLC : 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCLC : 90%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common in Pancreas Ca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RB1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retinoblastoma protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On chromosome &lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active when not phosphorylated; means when phosphorylated is not active
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The active form attachs to a transcription factor name: &lt;strong&gt;E2F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So active Rb makes E2F inactive ==&amp;gt; no cell division!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine Rb and E2F like parent and child.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and imagine phosphorylation like making the parent drunk ( no control on child! )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inactive when phosphorylated
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phosphorylation of Rb is by Cdk (Cyclin dependent kinase)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclin D and Cdk4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclin E and Cdk2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know one more thing and that's p21
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p21 inhibits the formation of Cyclin D
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;==&gt; Inhibits the phosphorylation of Rb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;==&gt; Inhibits the release of E2F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;==&gt; inhibits the cell cycle division&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So all in all p21 is good good for cell cycle control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p21 become active when there is DNA damage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So you can imagine this is a great cell cycle protection mechanism
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a DNA damage who wants the cell progress from G1 to S? nobody sure!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we want E2F protein not active and not free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So we need Rb tumor suppressor gene active
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so it can bind to E2F and inactivates E2F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep Rb activated one should inhibit the phosphorylation (you remember phosphorylation inactivates Rb)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What p21 does is that in detection of DNA damage inhibits Cdk ==&amp;gt; inhibits Rb phosphorylation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tumor suppressor protein
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if Rb gene is mutated ==&gt; It does not bind to E2F ==&gt; E2F is constantly released ==&gt; cell pass the restriction G1-S point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent excessive cell growth &lt;== inhibiting cell cycle progression until a cell is ready to divide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dysfunction ( loss of heterogeneity ) ==&amp;gt; Cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutated gene is recessive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pRb prevents the cell from replicating damaged DNA &lt;== preventing its progression along the cell cycle through G1 into S&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binds and inhibits transcription factors of the E2F family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc6&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDKN2A (p16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple tumor suppressor 1 (MTS-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tumor suppressor protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encoded by the CDKN2A gene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulating the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutations ==&gt; Cancer
&lt;ul&gt;

'''Applied Mathematics''' is the branch of mathematics which deals with applications of mathematics to the real world problems, often from problems stemming from the fields of engineering or theoretical physics. It is differentiated from '''Pure Mathematics''', which deals with more abstract problems. There is also something called '''Applicable Mathematics''', which deals with real world problems which need the techniques and mindset usually used in Pure Mathematics. These distinctions do not really become apparent during school level mathematics.

Examples of topics in Applied Mathematics:
*'''Fluid Dynamics''': the mathematics of fluid flow
*'''Quantum Mechanics applied to Engineering and Computer Science problems

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{print version|LPI Linux Certification/Print Version|Print this book}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
This book covers the Linux Professional Institute™ family of certifications. There are three levels of LPI™ certification:

*Level 1: Junior Level Linux Professional.
*Level 2: Advanced Level Linux Professional. 
*Level 3: Senior Level Linux Professional. 

To obtain a certification, a candidate is required to pass exams and, for Level 2 and Level 3, to hold a lower-level certification from the LPI™. All LPIC candidates are encouraged to browse the documentation at the LPI™ website. The resources there will familiarize the candidate with many things that are outside the scope of this book (e.g. exam cost, testing centers, other training resources) you are also encouraged to register with the LPI™ so that you can access the candidate area.&lt;br&gt;
The Detailed Objectives listed within each of the modules in this book have been reproduced from the LPI™ website with kind [[LPI Linux Certification/LPI Permission|Permission]]. We are however, to make it clear that the Linux Professional Institute™ does not endorse the work contained within this book in any way whatsoever.

== Audience ==
This book is written specifically for the LPIC candidate. It is based, as indeed is the exam, around a community driven documentation project known as &quot;The Linux Documentation Project&quot;. Each module in the book, however, is organized around a particular subject. It is hence feasible for the casual reader to pick one particular module and study its material with a view to gain a better understanding of just that material. However, many of the modules - and in particular the Advanced modules - will assume a certain skill level. It is also feasible for a new Linux user to come here with a view to learn Linux. However, although such readers are very welcome, they may be better served by studying the following material, [[Linux Guide]]. The modules on the LPI Linux certification are heavily slanted toward up-and-coming sysadmins.

== About this book ==
This book is organized so that each and every module can be accessed via the front page. This will be useful for readers who just wish to study or quickly gain information about one aspect of the exam syllabus. For exam candidates we have created an exam page which also has a table of contents that covers only the modules required for you to study for the various levels of the LPI™ . It is the hope of the contributors that the exam candidates will use the exam pages and their accompanying discussion pages to leave advice, tips and gotchas etc. for other exam candidates. 
&lt;br&gt;
The Module pages will contain detailed objectives followed by an overview which in turn will be followed by section headings covering the module's syllabus. At the beginning of each section will be a list of prequisite reading (hopefully all nicely formated). It is advisable to read them, although the linked articles may not be required knowledge to pass the exam. However, they should relate to the individual sections they are contained within.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Lastly, we are obviously looking for Authors, We encourage all positive edits even if it is just to correct a simple spelling mistake or fix a link; in short, &lt;big&gt;&quot;Every addition is very welcome.&quot;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Welcome! If you are here, then you are considering or have decided to take the Junior Level Linux Professional Exam. This page and its accompanying discussion page are specifically for you, and will explain your overall objectives for each exam (there are two exams you must complete before being certified). It is a good idea to come back here and perform a sanity check on your understanding against the overall objectives presented here. All that remains is for the authors and contributors of this book to wish you good luck.

'''Please note DO NOT contribute actual exam questions you may have been presented with in the past ANYWHERE in this book'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==
When you first see 'find' in Pro/Engineer Wildfire you might overlook it or wonder what it is for? It is an evolution of the 'find in model tree' function which has been around since the model tree was introduced. (version 18 or 20)

In wildfire the find command takes on a more useful role. The find tool also replaces the functionality of the old 'SEL BY MENU' menu e.g. select last feature, select by ID. 

On it's own the find command is not earth shattering revolution but it is one those gadgets that is probably really boring like a can opener but also really useful. If it is boring you are unlikely to see it covered properly on training courses, in magazines or on web pages. 

The find tool is more useful in Wildfire because it has two modes first mode is:- An independent gadget for finding features or components by name, status etc. The second mode:- is embedded into functions such as simplified reps.

==Independent mode==
Once a set of features or components have been found and the 'Find' dialogue the items are 'selected' which means they can be acted on e.g. delete, suppress etc. To select items specify the search criteria click 'Find Now' and then click OK to close the find dialogue. All the found items will be highlighted and ready to be edited.

Alternatively the query can be saved as layer so all the found items are added to a layer.

A more complex search can be built by building a query where a series of search criteria must be satisfied. The criteria are linked by and/or conditions.

==Embedded mode==
Find is also embedded into functions such as simplified rep, component display. In these functions the find can be used to select a set of components or define a rule so components are selected each time the model is regenerated.

Library parts
&quot;_screw&quot;, &quot;_nut&quot;

or if you identify library parts with parameters (e.g. Part_type=library) you can select them using an expression rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transcendentalist Theology concept supports existentialism in the way it relates to man's responsibility for his own soul with the premise that human fallibility and misconceptions have labeled spirituality as God for the past several millennia; as one who interferes with the natural forces and free will of people by threatening punishment to those who disobey his bidding. The spiritual existence of this deity, if one decides to accept this premise, could not have changed with the times but the perception of who or what this deity is should change as societies eliminate their superstitious beliefs. This “God” could not possibly be encumbered by human attributes, needs or desires to be worshiped, prayed to, exalted, venerated, deified, or anything else that mankind has to offer. It is also the human characteristics and attributes that exercise upon others: power, control, dominance, destruction, punishment, revenge, and judgment.

The destruction of civilizations, most sufferings and premature deaths are due to human frailties, stupidity or imperfections and are not God's doings. The true “God” is a Spiritual Unity that exists in a spiritual realm and never has and never will interfere with anything on earth or in the universe. God is interested in and is involved in humanity, but does not interfere in any way in our physical lives. God guides the development of the universe and everything thereon like a Master Planner. Our relationship and interaction of our spirit with the Spirit of God is for our, not God's benefit.

[[Image:Jacques-Louis_David_017.jpg|thumb|right|200px||Napoleon I of France, by Jacques-Louis David.]]

In a better attempt to prevent freely elected royalists from taking control of the Directory in 1799, members of the bourgeois sent Napoleon Bonaparte and his army to defend the Directory and the annulment of the elections.  However, Napoleon took advantage of this situation and in the Coup of Brumaire took control of the nation.

== The Consulate 1799-1804 ==

Napoleon seized control and initially installed an enlightened despotism known as the Consulate.  During this time, Napoleon instituted a number of important Enlightened reforms.  The most important of these is his Napoleonic Code, which provided freedom of religion, a uniform law codes, social and legal equality, property rights, and end feudal dues.  He also implemented a state-wide compulsory education, known as the University of France. In 1801 he ended dechristianization.

== The Empire 1804-1814 ==

[[Image:Europe map Napoleon 1811.png|thumb|left|250px|Napoleonic Empire, 1811:
France in dark blue, satellite states in light blue]]

Napoleon declared himself French Emperor and became a military dictator.  Napoleon was undefeated against his three main continental enemies, defeating Austria, Russia, and Prussia multiple times.  During his tenure, he took control of large amounts of mainland Europe.  However, Napoleon failed to subdue England, and was defeated in his attempt to crush the English Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar by Admiral Nelson.  As a result, Napoleon employed the Continental System, a method of economic warfare.  He prohibited trade with the British by blockading all coasts of Europe from English export.  Unfortunately for Napoleon, this failed, as the British still were able to smuggle goods into Europe, and were also able to trade with their colonies, Asia, and the United States.  Napoleon eliminated the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1806 consolidated it into 40 states and named it the Confederation of the Rhine.

After Alexander I of Russia withdrew from the Continental System, Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812.  For the first time, Napoleon failed, as the Russian army employed scorched earth tactics to defeat Napoleon's army.  However, Napoleon quickly raised a new army, but this army was crushed by the Quadruple Alliance of England, Austria, Russia, and Prussia at the Battle of Nations/Leipzig in 1813.  Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba, but he managed to escape and return in 1815 in a period known as the Hundred Days.  The Quadruple Alliance again crushed his new army at the Battle of Waterloo, led by the great British General Wolsey (Duke of Wellington).  Napoleon was then exiled to the island of Saint Helena where he died in 1821.

== The Congress of Vienna 1814-1815 ==

The Quadruple Alliance assembled at the Congress of Vienna to create a post-Napoleonic Europe.  Their representatives were Castlereagh of England, who assembled the Quadruple Alliance, Talleyrand of France, Metternich of Austria, and Alexander I of Russia.

The Congress of Vienna was incredibly lenient toward France.  It simply restored the old boundaries and restored Louis XVIII to the throne.  It imposed no reparations.  This was done because the allies desired a stable, prosperous France that would not threaten them with revolution or invasion.

== The Restoration of Louis XVIII Bourbon ==

Louis XVIII did not wipe out the gains of the Revolution.  Rather, out of fear of revolution, he signed the Charter of 1814 that provided legal equality, offices open to all men, a two chamber parliament, Napoleonic civil code, and the abolition of feudalism.

== A Shift in Foreign Policy ==

After Napoleon's fall, European foreign policy took a major shift.  While preserving the balance of power was still important, now much more prominently featured in war would be advocates of liberalism (revolutionaries, republicans, nationalists) versus conservatism or the &quot;Old Regime&quot; (the monarchy, aristocrats, clergymen).

Old Regime monarchs, led by Klemens Wenzel von Metternich of Austria, used the Congress System, also known as the Concert of Europe, to prevent revolution and war.  At the Congress System the leading of nations of Europe worked together to prevent the outbreak of revolution in each nation.

== A New Nationalism ==

Many of the territories occupied by Napoleon during his Empire began to feel a new sense of nationalism.  During the occupation, Napoleon destroyed and disallowed many nation's individual cultures, and the people of these nations greatly resented this.  As a result, Napoleon's conquests spurred a new nationalism in the occupied nations, particularly in Germany and Italy, at a level that had never previously existed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The early nineteenth century was dominated by the aftermath of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Although Napoleon was defeated in 1815 and the Bourbon monarchy restored to France, many European states were transformed by the 25 years of conflict. States such as Prussia, Austria and the Netherlands found themselves expanded by the peace settlement of 1815. Conversely, other countries, most notably Poland, were dissolved in this process of state consolidation. These national upheavals were accompanied by a heightened sense of nationalism amongst the population of many states, which had been encouraged by Enlightenment ideas, spread throughout Europe by the Napoleonic conquests.

In the decades following the peace of 1815 many European countries were beset by social conflicts as the populations sought to assert their rights against the often autocratic rulers of their states. This was to produce what the historian Eric Hobsbawn has dubbed ''the Age of Revolutions'', as the tensions within states were to frequently erupt into large-scale political upheavals, such as the French revolutions of 1830 and 1848.

==Europe in the Age of Revolutions==
Europe was a turbulent continent in the period after the Napoleonic Wars. Although the Treaty of Vienna had tried to restore many European states to their pre-war states, the influence of the war years was significant, particularly the Enlightenment ideas that were spread throughout Europe by Napoleon's armies. The result was an age of revolutions. A distinctive feature was the manner in which waves of revolutions could sweep through Europe, most notably in 1830 and 1848, when popular revolt in France influenced the people of other states to rebel against their rulers.

===Belgium===

Prior to the nineteenth century the southern part of the Netherlands had been dominated by foreign powers, most notably the Hapsburg states of Spain and Austria. However, the critical geographical position of the area led the major powers of Europe, in the Treaty of Vienna, to cede the territory to the Dutch Republic in 1815, to create the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This caused resentment within the region; local liberals resented the autocratic nature of the Dutch king, whilst conservative Catholics disliked the dominance of Dutch Protestantism. 

These tensions were to lead to the revolution of 1830, when the region declared itself independent, taking the name Belgium in reference to the Celtic tribes who had lived in the area in ancient times. The response of the Dutch government came in August 1831, when the Dutch Army set off on a so called &quot;Ten Days Campaign&quot;. It was very successful, as the Dutch army pushed into the heart of Belgium within just a few days, also capturing the key city of Antwerp. However, after a desperate Belgian appeal for French help, French troops crossed the border into Belgium. With Russia too busy to guard the Dutch back, both sides agreed to a ceasefire. On December 20, 1830, the European powers recognized Belgium's de facto independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was not until April 19, 1839 however, that the Treaty of London signed by the European powers (including the Netherlands) recognized Belgium as an independent and neutral country.

===France===

The Treaty of Vienna saw the Bourbon monarchy restored to France. Although the first king after this restoration, Louis XVIII, managed the country well, his successor, Charles X, proved to be unpopular. An autocratic ruler, Charles passed a number of acts that stripped away power promised by Louis to the people. This concluded in the July Ordinances, which dissolved Parliament. As a result, the people of France broke into revolution, known as the July Revolution, replacing Charles X with Louis-Philippe Orleans in what is known as the July Monarchy.

====The 1848 Revolution and Louis Napoleon====

[[Image:LodewijkNap.jpg|thumb|250px|Louis Bonaparte]]

In February 1848, the citizens revolted again, this time forming a provisional government led by two men, Lamartine, a political republican who advocated freemarket, and Blanc, a social republican, who advocated socialism. Blanc created a system known as the national workships that provided employment to the masses in France.

The National Assembly of 1848 established universal male suffrage, and the people that year elected virtually no socialists. The new government threw out the national workshops, resulting in a revolt by the people. The people, looking to the former glory of France, installed Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, relative of Napoleon Bonaparte, the throne.

President Louis Napoleon Bonaparte rebuilt central Paris, installing new apartments, straight, long, and wide streets, sewage, and sanitation. He also widened the streets in Paris, in an attempt to subvert future revolution, since in the past, revolutionaries in France had used the streets to barricade themselves.

Emperor Napoleon III is often referred to as the socialist emperor because he gave many socialized programs to the citizens. He gave hospitals, socialized medicine, the right to unionize and strike, shorter hours, injured worker homes, a revamped prison system, and more.

However, Napoleon III was also militarily inept. He chose to get involved in wars which he didn't have to, trying to live up to the glory of Napoleon I. He was defeated in his involvement in the Italian unification movement where he sent troops to Rome to protect the Pope, in his involvement with the Mexican Empire from 1862-1867, and in the Franco-Prussian War from 1870-1871, during which he was actually captured by the Prussians.

===Great Britain===
Whilst reform in many European states was only achieved with the aid of bloody revolution, British parliamentary democracy meant that Great Britain managed to reform and modernise relatively peacefully. The most notable instance of this is the Reform Act of 1832, which reallocated seats in the House of Commons to address the new industrial cities of Britain, and increased suffrage from 500,000 men to 800,000 men. This was to be followed thirty years later by the Reform Act of 1867 granted suffrage to 1/3 of British men. By 1884, 2 to 4.5 million men had suffrage in Britain, including urban workers.

Britain saw other reforms, such as the 1833 Factory Act, which outlawed the employment of children under the age of 9 and limited the workdays of all children. The Mines Act of 1842 was a similar piece of reformist legislation, formally prohibiting women and children from working underground.

====British Corn Laws====

[[Image:Robert Peel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|British Prime Minister Robert Peel]]

One of the most entertaining pieces of political reform during this era was not related to working life, but to the economic management of Britain. The Corn Laws were taxes placed on imported goods to protect Britain's own goods. They forced the British people to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain by putting a tariff on French grain, which tended to be less expensive and higher quality. The goal was to keep British money in Britain, rather than being spent on importing French grain.

The Corn Laws were passed by the members of the Tory party in Parliament. The Tories were populated by the Landed Gentry. The Whigs, which represented the working class, merchants, factory owners, and so forth in Britain, were opposed to the Corn Laws, but because the Tories controlled Parliament, they were unable to stop the passage of the Corn Laws. The expensive price of British grain necessitated a rise in wages, and factory owners such as David Ricardo were forced to pay higher wages so that their workers could afford the food. Ricardo thus concluded that the Corn Laws simply redistributed wealth from the industrialists to the landowners.

In 1819, 80,000 people gathered in Manchester demanding the repeal of the Corn Laws. British soldiers opened fire, killing 11 demonstrators, in what became known as the Peterloo Massacre. As a result, the Anti-Corn Law League was established in Manchester, and used pamphlets, mass demonstrations, and torchlight parades to protest the Corn Laws.

In 1846, the Corn Laws were repealed under Prime Minister Robert Peel. The government was still led by Tories, but the Irish Potato Famine led to the repeal, demonstrating the new power of the industrialists in England.


===Spain===
Spain was a country in turmoil during the age of revolutions. Occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, a brutal &quot;war of independence&quot; was waged against the occupiers that led to an emergent Spanish nationalism. An era of reaction against the liberal ideas associated with revolutionary France followed the war, personified by the rule of Ferdinand VII and—to a lesser extent—his daughter Isabella II. Ferdinand's rule included the loss of the Spanish colonies in the New World, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, in the 1810s and 1820s. A series of civil wars then broke out in Spain, pitting Spanish liberals and then republicans against conservatives, culminating in the Carlist Wars between the moderate Queen Isabella and her uncle, the reactionary Infante Carlos. Disaffection with Isabella's government from many quarters led to repeated military intervention in political affairs and to several revolutionary attempts against the government. Two of these revolutions were successful,the moderate Vicalvarada or &quot;Vicálvaro Revolution&quot; of 1854 and the more radical la Gloriosa (Glorious Revolution) in 1868. The latter marks the end of Isabella's monarchy. The brief rule of the liberal king Amadeo I of Spain ended in the establishment of the First Spanish Republic, only to be replaced in 1874 by the popular, moderate rule of Alfonso XII of Spain, which finally brought Spain into a period of stability and reform.

===1848 Revolutions in the Rest of Europe===

In Italy unemployment, demands for land, and higher wages led to revolts. King Charles Albert led a military campaign against Austria, while Mazzini attempted to organize a republic in Rome. The movement largely failed, however, because different groups of nationalists could not agree on goals. The Austria defeated the campaign, and Napoleon Bonaparte sent troops to Rome.

In Germany revolts started in order to achieve more liberal rights, but the goals were soon replaced with nationalistic sentiments. The Constituent Assembly, under the direction of 800 delegates from the German states, offered Frederick William IV, King of Prussia, the crown of a unified Germany. However, this movement failed as well, as the Constituent Assembly had no actual power and Frederick would not accept a crown &quot;from the gutter&quot;. Prussian troops put down revolts in Berlin as well as other revolts throughout Germany.

In Austria, demands for political reform and nationalism created demands for autonomy. Metternich fled to England, and Emperor Ferdinand fled in favor of Franz Joseph. Revolts occurred in Vienna, Prague, and Hungary. A Slavic congress was set up in Prague, Hungarians demanded autonomous rule. Eventually, with the aid of Russia, Austria was able to suppress the revolutions.

===The Era of Realpolitik===

Before 1848, idealism and reason were at the forefront of people's minds. However, after 1848, the concept of Realpolitik and action arose. This new toughness of mind rejected high-minded ideology for action, and marked the end of the Enlightenment.

On the right, Otto von Bismarck of Germany took Realpolitik actions, manipulating the Ems Telegram in order to spur war with France (Franco-Prussian War) and thus assist the process of German unity. Emperor Napoleon III also did so, widening the streets of Paris during his reconstruction of Paris in order to prevent barricading in the case of revolution. Finally, Cavour of Italy is an excellent example of a practitioner of Realpolitik, as he got Napoleon III to attack Austria over Lombardy-Venetia.

On the left, Marx and Bakunin were practitioners of Realpolitik, advocating violent revolution among the proletariat in order to install a new communist system.

==Industrial Revolution==

The 
shift that precipitated many of the conflicts of the early nineteenth century was the industrial revolution. The growing industrial base of many European countries was to encourage urbanization, often at the expense of the living conditions of the workers. This was coupled with new agrarian technologies which required fewer people to work the land, whilst producing greater agricultural yields. In some countries this precipitated an industrial revolution, where urban industry played an increasingly dominant role in the economy. This process was first seen in Britain, Prussia and the Netherlands in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century whilst other countries, such as France, Italy and the United States of America were to industrialize in the late nineteenth century. Some states, such as Russia and Austria, failed to industrialize significantly in this period, a factor that would lead to later difficulties during the First World War.

===The Prefiguration of Industry===

The first evidence of industrial production can be found in the large cities of early modern Europe. Even the modest size of European capitals at the beginning of the modern period allowed for a specialization of trade and, as the cities grew, production increasingly took place in specialist workshops. Tradesmen, who had previously taken only one or two apprentices, began to take larger teams of workers, a process that transformed itself into the paid employment of labor in industrial enterprise. A similar shift took place in rural areas, with what was known as &quot;putting out&quot; or &quot;cottage industry&quot;, where agricultural workers would take raw materials from contractors and use them to produce finished goods.

Despite these developments little could be done without a proper transportation system, which would allow goods to be moved and marketed. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the cost of transporting goods overland was prohibitively expensive for all but the shortest journeys.

===Beginnings of Industry===

The age of industry for Europe began with slow progress in the 1780s. Western Europe tended to advance more quickly than the east. Britain initially led the way. Progress remained slow until the 1850s, because most people continued to use old methods, and population increases reduced the benefits of industrialization. As a result, the industrial age did not start in continental Europe until after 1815, and was not complete in Britain until 1850.

In 1750, Britain was only slightly ahead of France in its industrial production. By 1830, its industrialization was at twice the level of France, and by 1860, three times. Other countries were further behind; much of Europe's progress was retarded by political and social turmoil, as well as constant warfare. Industrialization also was limited by lack of transportation, reluctance to cease traditional business practices, and lack of technology.

Stephenson's rocket, a train engine, allowed wagons to be pulled along railroad tracks, allowing for the quick transportation of materials, goods, people, and communication. Population increased rapidly across Europe. Finally, the steam-powered engine was invented and improved, allowing for mechanization in industry.

By 1815, continental Europe had started to see progress. Its industrialization was facilitated by a large skilled labor force, strong governments, and no need to develop new ideas as Britain had already set a precedent for other nations to follow. European governments became much more involved in industrialization, building an infrastructure of railroads and canals. The German government created the [[w:Zollverein|Zollverein]], a customs-free trade union, which allowed goods to move freely within the German states without being hampered by tariffs. Governments also played a role in banking, and they allowed banks to become corporations, such as Crédit Mobilier of Paris.

By 1851, Britain was the &quot;workshop of the world.&quot; Britain had 2/3 of the world's known coal supply, and 1/2 of its iron. Centers of continental industrialization included Belgium, France, and Germany.

===Social Impact of the Industrial Revolution===

[[Image:Dore_London.jpg|thumb|225px|right|''Over London by Rail'' [[w:Gustave Doré|Gustave Doré]] c 1870. Shows the densely populated and polluted environments created in the new industrial cities]]

The Industrial Revolution resulted in poor urban living conditions with no sanitation. Urban and industrial growth went beyond the state's control. Public drunkenness as a reaction to the dismal lifestyle became prominent, and the cities were filthy and living conditions tight. Life expectancy was very short, and disease was rampant. New social classes, particularly the industrial middle class and urban workers, emerged as well. The standard of living decreased for many, with low wages and high prices, as well as horrible working conditions and the employment of children.

Noticing the poor crowded city conditions and impoverished workers in industrial Europe, several economists expressed their pessimistic predictions on the future of the industrial society.

====Thomas Malthus (1766–1834)====

[[w:Thomas Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] was an English economist with a grim prediction for the future. ''[[w:An Essay on the Principle of Population|An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' stated that the population was outgrowing the food supply, and that this would inevitably cause a &quot;great hunger,&quot; or massive food shortage. Malthus suggested, as a solution to this problem, marrying later in life to slow the population growth, but he was not optimistic that this plan would ever come to fruition.

====David Ricardo (1772-1823)====

[[w:David Ricardo|David Ricardo]], in his ''[[w:Iron Law of Wages|Iron Law of Wages]]'', predicted that the income of wage-earning workers would remain below or just near subsistence levels, despite any attempts to raise wages.

===British Working Class Responses to Industrialisation===

====Luddism====

The [[w:Luddites|Luddites]] were a group of workers opposed to the effects of the mechanisation of industry, particularly in textiles. The advent of large scale spinning and weaving machines meant that textiles could be produced at lower costs than previously, undercutting the prices of the traditional cottage industry of handloom weavers. 

The attacks of the Luddites began in 1811 and were targeted at the machinery of factory and workshop owners. The campaigns of the Luddites were often closely targeted at specific forms of machinery and, despite the modern connotations of the name, the group were not opposed to progress in principle.

The name of the group is derived from its fictional leader, Ned Ludd. This figure was used as a focal point for demonstrations, and to distract attention from the real leaders of various protests.

The Luddites were followed some years later by the Swing rioters who, following a mythical leader, Captain Swing, opposed the mechanization of agriculture. The Swing riots mostly occurred during the early 1830s and were put down with often severe force.

====Trade Unionism====

The Luddites were, in essence, part of a reactive movement, fighting against the modernization of methods of production. An alternative, and often more effective, method of action, was the organisation of workers into trade unions, where rights could be secured through collective bargaining and the threat of strikes. Whilst such movements were often not illegal in themselves, many of their actions were. It was, for instance, considered a criminal offence for a workman to break his contract and striking workers could be charged for offences relating to conspiracy or breaches of public order.

Despite this there was a sustained demand on the part of the workers that their rights be recognized and the persistent campaigns of workers eventually achieved the legal recognition of unions.

====Chartism====
[[w:Chartism|Chartism]] was the first large-scale working class political movement.

The [[w:London Working Men's Association|London Working Men's Association]] wrote reform goals in a charter, with six points:
# Universal male suffrage
# Annual election of House of Commons
# Secret ballots
# Equal electoral districts (to prevent &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;)
# Abolition of property requirements for the House of Commons
# Salaries of members of the House of Commons

Although the Chartist movement did not see immediate success in its aims, all of the main points of the charter, with the exception of annual elections, were adopted by the early twentieth century.

==Society and Culture==

===Capitalism===
Industry of Britain, western Europe, and the United States developed within the system of [[w:capitalism|capitalism]]. &quot;Capital&quot; is a medium of exchange for property or services that are valued. Capitalist systems require the [[w:laissez-faire|laissez-faire]] principle of minimal government intervention.

===Republicanism===

Republicanism advocated liberty, fraternity, and equality, and was in favor of Constitutions, Parliaments, and democracies. It opposed the monarchy, aristocracy, and the church. Republicans tended to be students, writers, members of the intelligentsia, and also workers. Republicans were supporters of the French Revolution and its ideals.

===Liberalism===
[[w:Liberalism|Liberalism]], or classic liberalism, at the time advocated free trade, laissez faire, constitutions, parliaments, and no violence. It didn't advocate democracy, but rather constitutional monarchy. Liberals tended to be middle class merchants and professionals.

===Conservatism===
[[w:Conservatism|Conservatism]] rose as a reaction to the liberal ideas that began with the violence, terror, and social disorder of the [[w:French Revolution|French Revolution]]. It was supported by the traditional ruling class, as well as by the peasants. Conservatives believed in order of the society and state, based on faith and tradition. [[w:Metternich|Metternich]] was the champion of Conservatism and tried to preserve its ideals and the Old Regime through the Congress System. Conservatives were opposed to the Enlightenment and its effects, and were anti-revolution, anti-democracy, and anti-nationalism. They preferred tradition, gradual reform, and the maintenance of the Old Regime.

===Socialism===
[[w:Socialism|Socialism]] is the theory or system of social organization in which the means of productions and distribution of goods are owned collectively or by a central government authority. The idea was fostered to combat the industrial society that allowed millions to toil endlessly while a few owners reaped all the benefits of their labor. Socialists argued that liberalism was fragmenting society, and that socialism would reunite it. After 1815, socialism became the new radical doctrine, especially in France. Socialists fought to protect the interests of the workers rather than capitalists, and argued that wealth is unfairly distributed and that thus workers deserve a larger share. Socialism was a diverse political philosophy and encompassed the views of many different thinkers, such as Saint-Simon, Fourier and Owen.

====Henri de Saint-Simon====
[[w:Henry de Saint-Simon|Henry de Saint-Simon]] believed that the elite of society lacked the skills necessary to be valued so highly. He believed that rewards should be in proportion to one's social contribution, and that society should be run by qualified technocrats, or a technically skilled elite.

====Charles Fourier====
[[w:Charles Fourier|Charles Fourier]] was a French merchant, whose experiences of the French Revolution led him to believe that free market capitalism in general, and speculation in particular, was damaging to the welfare of all. His solution was to suggest a planned economy, based around idea communities known as ''phalanstries'', where 1,620 people would live in a single building surrounded by 5,000 acres of land. By centralising production, efficient agriculture and industry could be achieved. Although his plans were never put into practice, his utopian socialism was an important influence on later thinkers.

====Robert Owen====
Robert Owen was a Welsh manufacturer. In his mills at New Lanark in Scotland he proved that investing in the welfare of employees could be profitable. He provided his workers with schools and free accommodation. By doing this Owen was rewarded with a hard-working and loyal workforce, and his mills were some of the most profitable and productive in Britain.

Owen was later to invest his profits in the community of New Harmony in the United States of America. The community was heavily reliant upon the leadership of Owen and quickly foundered. Although Owen's communities did not long outlast his lifetime, his thinking was highly influential amongst later socialists, and the term ''communist'' was originally coined to describe Owen's followers.

====Karl Marx (1818-1883)====

Probably the most important socialist thinker of the nineteenth century was the German writer Karl Marx. Marx's rise to prominence began in the Year of Revolutions, 1848, with the publication of ''The Communist Manifesto'', a volume which he wrote with the help of Frederick Engels. The book was an attempt to create political tension between economic classes around the world. He also wrote ''Das Kapital'', a critique of capitalism that argues as to why Marx believed capitalism should fail. He sought to incite the violent revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeois. The proletariat described the working class, while the bourgeois described the middle and upper classes that owned the means of production. This revolution would be caused by what Marx described as a historic class struggle between these two groups. After this revolution, Marx argued for the formation of a classless society, in which no private property, religion, or government existed.

Marx also advocated the concept of dialectical materialism. The theory states that history is driven by economic conditions and material private property inequality. This theory was based on Hegel's dialectic theory, in which a thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis. The end of Marx's concept of dialectical history is the synthesis of communism because private property is prohibited. Marx believed that the rise of the proletariat was inevitable, even if he had never existed and written his book. This is what separates Marxism from Utopian Socialism - Utopian Socialism required the benevolent and peaceful surrender of the means of production by capitalists.

=== Utilitarianism ===

Proposed by Bentham, it suggested that the best form of government does the most good for the greatest number of people.

=== Nationalism ===

Nationalism was spawned by Napoleon's empire, and emphasized pride in one's language, tradition, culture, and religion. Nationalism caused conflict over boundaries in Europe. Nationalists frequently looked to folktales, poems, songs, grammar, and dictionaries for sources of traditional culture in a nation. Nationalism especially came to rise in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Poland, and Hungary.

===Romantic Art===

The romantic art movement took place in the 1800s, especially emphasizing emotion, imagination, drama, disorder, and dark colors. Romantic art typically portrays the mystical communion of art and nature, typically using picturesque or exotic subjects. Romantic art reinforced individualism.

====Francisco Goya (1746-1828)====

[[Image:El_Tres_de_Mayo,_by_Francisco_de_Goya,_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[w:Francisco Goya|Francisco Goya]]. ''The Third of May 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid''. 1814. Oil on canvas. 345 x 266 cm. Madrid: [[w:Museo del Prado|Museo del Prado]].]]

Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes was an influential Spanish painter of the Romantic period. Perhaps his most famous work was ''The Third of May 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid'', which portrays the Napoleonic Wars in Spain, with a faceless French firing squad murdering members of the Spanish resistance.

====Delacroix====

Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix was the leader of the French Romanticism in painting. Delacroix's techniques would prove to be an important influence on others. His use of expressive color profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionist and Symbolist movements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The period between 1870 and 1914 saw a Europe that was considerably more stable than that of previous decades. To a large extent this was the product of the formation of new states in Germany and Italy, and political reformations in older, established states, such as Britain and Austria. This internal stability, along with the technological advances of the industrial revolution, meant that European states were increasingly able and willing to pursue political power abroad.

Imperialism was not, of course, a concept novel to the nineteenth century. A number of European states, most notably Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, had carved out large overseas empires in the age of exploration. However, the new technologies of the nineteenth century encouraged imperial growth. [[w:Quinine|Quinine]], for instance, allowed for the conquest of inland Africa, whilst the telegraph enabled states to monitor their imperial possessions around the world. When the value of these new technologies became apparent, the states of Europe began to take control of large swathes of territory in Africa and Asia, heralding in a new era of imperialism

==The States of Europe==

===France===

After France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck required France to hold elections so that he could negotiate a peace. Elections were held for a provisional government, and monarchists were elected, which was unacceptable to revolutionaries of Paris. Paris responded by forming its own government, a 40 member council or &quot;commune&quot; with its own national guard.  The commune established the equality of all citizens, promotion of women's rights, and communal workshops. On May 21, Adolph Theirs, leader of the French provisional government, sent in troops to &quot;restore order&quot; in Paris. Members of the commune killed the Archbishop, packed the Tuileries with gunpowder, and blew it up. When it was all over, however, 20,000 Parisians had been killed by the troops.

Thus began the 3rd Republic of France from 1871 until 1940. The 3rd Republic consisted of a ceremonial President and a two chamber Parliament with universal male suffrage.

===Germany===
[[Image:Bismarck_pickelhaube.jpg|thumb|Otto von Bismarck]]

The idea of a German state had existed since the formation of the Kingdom of Germany in the early Middle Ages. The kingdom was succeeded by the Holy Roman Empire, but the authority of the emperors was weak, and the power of the central state declined until its final abolition in 1806. In 1815 the German-speaking territories were divided into around 40 states, many of them small.

The beginnings of popular nationalism in Germany can be traced to Napoleon's invasion of German territory in 1806. Whilst this act helped precipitate the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Napoleon's political machinations helped to encourage nationalist feeling. Many people within the German heartlands wished to escape the influence of foreign autocrats, such as the emperors of France and Austria, and build their own state. 

This broad feeling was encouraged by the works of eighteenth century German writers and philosophers, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and particularly Johann Gottfried von Herder. With his work on aesthetics, gothic art, and folk poetry, Herder encouraged an idea that the Germans had a rich common cultural heritage. Although Herder glorified the Germans, he was well travelled, feeling that every country had its unique features, and was worthy of some admiration.

However, the unification of Germany was not solely due to nationalism. It is worth noting that, in an era when Europe was increasingly dominated by large empires, many German states were small to the point of insignificance. Most German rulers understood that there was strength in working together. This understanding was to lead to inter-state co-operation across the region, the most notable example being the ''Zollverein'', the customs union that encompassed most of northern Germany by the early 1830s.

This variety of factors, both nationalistic and economic, were exploited by the conservative King of Prussia, William I, and his chief minister, Otto von Bismarck. Both understood the value of a unified German state, particularly one which excluded Austrian influence. 

====Wars of Unification====
Whilst he had a clear idea that the unification of Germany should be his goal, Bismarck was a shrewd politician and exploited, rather than initiated, events. The complicated dynastic successions within the German confederation proved to be a useful tool to this end.

The first such conflict was triggered by the Schleswig-Holstein problem. Schleswig and Holstein were German duchies whose ruler was also the Danish king, Frederick VII. Frederick's death in 1863 caused consternation amongst German nationalists as his successor, Christian IX, decided to annex Schleswig and Holstein, and make the German duchies into part of the Danish state. The Diet of the German Confederation demanded that this be prevented and encouraged Prussia and Austria, the only German states to have significant military strength, to invade Denmark.

The war between Denmark and the Germany states was short and decisive and the Danes were defeated in 1864. In the resultant peace treaty, the Danish king renounced his rights to the disputed territories of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia and Austria respectively.

The occupation of Schleswig and Holstein was to prove the catalyst for the next German war, the Seven Weeks War of 1866. Whilst control of these provinces was regulated by the Gastein Convention of 1865, Bismarck was able to provoke the Austrians into declaring war. This was as decisive as the previous conflict. The meticulously planned Prussian advances outmaneuvered the Austrians, who were forced on the defensive, and quickly defeated. 

In 1867, Prussia established the North German Confederation, made up of 21 small northern states with a constitution and Kaiser Wilhelm as king. The small states were still in a vacuum, however, and needed some form of encouragement to join with Prussia.

In 1870, Prince Leopold Hohenzollern was asked to take the crown in Spain, and France demanded that the Prussians agree that no Hohenzollern ever take the Spanish throne in the so-called &quot;Ems Dispatch.&quot; Bismarck manipulated the telegram; his modifications made France and Germany appear more hostile than they actually were. After he released it to the press in Europe, France declared war on Prussia, and the remaining German states joined Prussia for protection.

The Franco-Prussian war lasted from 1870 to 1871, and resulted in the defeat of [[w:Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon III]]. He was captured on September 2, 1870 at the Battle of Sedan. On January 18, 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed at Versailles as a major snub to the French. On May 1871, the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed, and France ceded Alsace-Lorraine and 5 billion gold francs to Germany.

===Italy===

Throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period Italy consisted of a patchwork of small states. Its urbanization and position in the Mediterranean meant that Italy was a politically important region and, for much of this period it was dominated by foreign powers, most notably the Bourbon dynasty which, during the eighteenth century, provided kings for both France and Spain. 

The dominance of foreign powers was brought to an end by the Napoleonic wars. Napoleon's attempts to dominate the peninsula failed, and the monarchies of France and Spain were weakened by long years of war. Moreover, Napoleon had attempted to conglomerate much of Italy into a single state, a process that encouraged a sense of the Italians belonging to a nation. It is notable, for instance, that Napoleon provided Italy with its national flag, the green, white, and red ''tricolore''.

Although the Treaty of Vienna restored many of the small Italian states, nationalist feeling remained, and was preserved by nationalistic and revolutionary groups, such as the ''Carbonari'' in southern Italy. These groups were inspired by revolutionary activity in other European states. As a result, the early nineteenth century saw numerous small insurrections against the autocrats ruling the Italian states, most notably with the French-inspired revolts of 1831, which afflicted the Papal States. Such revolts were frequently small in scale, however, and were easily dealt with by the rulers of Italy.

The Italian Unification movement was led primarily by two central figures: Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, who supplied much of the ideology for the movement, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, who led the fighting of the movement. Cavour was the Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia and served King Victor Emmanuel II. He built up the strength of Piedmont-Sardinia, establishing a strong army, a healthy economy, and political freedoms, such as freedom of the press. He gained the support of Napoleon III by promising him Savoy and Nice. Austria invaded Italy, but the Italians, aided by French troops, defeated the Austrians at the battles of Magenta and Solferino.

Garibaldi led the Red Shirts, or guerrilla fighters in Italy. He was a supporter of a republic but conceded to a monarchy. He took his forces into southern Italy and successfully conquered Naples and the two Sicilies. Cavour sent troops south to stop Garibaldi from invading Rome, which was occupied by French troops, but both sides met in Naples and surprisingly became allies. In 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was declared with Piedmont's Victor Emmanuel as king. However, Italy's agrarian south and industrial north had difficulty uniting, and the unification was not complete until 1870, at the end of the Franco-Prussian War.

===Russia===
[[Image:Cartetsar.JPG|thumb|right|Tsar Alexander II, his wife Marie and son, the future Alexander III]]
During the late 1800s, Russia began to work to increase its power and to overall westernize itself. The state was considered weaker in military terms than other nations and had lost to Britain and France in the [[#Crimean War|Crimean War]] of 1853–1856. It had an autocratic tsar with no social contract, and serfdom still existed in Russia. There was a small middle class with much less industrialization.

Nicholas I came to power after the death of his brother, Alexander I. His reign began marred by the Decembrist revolt of 1825 among the soldiers, some of whom supported his other brother. Thus, Nicholas ruled through police action and use of the army.

Alexander II came to power, using the defeat in the Crimean War as the major impetus to reform. He believed that Russia needed to follow the European model in order to become more powerful. As a result, in 1861, he gave the serfs freedom. However, the serfs were still bound in many ways to their formal feudal dues. The former serfs were given only half of the land, and the nobles were allowed to keep the other half. In addition, former serfs had to pay a communal redemption fee to their former lords.

In addition, Alexander II ended the secret police started by Nicholas I, and he created public trials that had professional judges with state salaries as well as juries. Zemstvos were created, which were local provincial councils, elected by the people, that dealt with local governmental issues such as roads and schools. Finally, Alexander reduced the draft from 25 years to 6 years.

Despite Alexander's actions, unrest continued in Russia. Peasant revolutionaries resented the redemption fees, and two new groups arose in Russia. The first, the nihilists, believed in nothing but science and rejected traditional society and culture. The second, the anarchists, led by Mikhail Bakunin, set out to destroy any government, even a reformist tsar like Alexander II. In 1881, an anarchist group known as the &quot;People's Will&quot; assassinated Alexander II with a bomb.

====Russo-Japanese War 1904–1905====

In 1860, the Russians founded the city of Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean, and began work on the Trans-Siberian Railroad to connect the East to the West. The Russo-Japanese war was caused by the imperialist ambitions of Russia and Japan in Manchuria and Korea. In a number of key battles, the war resulted in a surprise victory for Japan in a peace agreement brokered by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905.

The war resulted in the establishment of Japan as a major world power. Japan modeled European industrialization and militarism, and increased its focus on China, gaining dominion over Korea and establishing a claim to Manchuria. This expansion helped to cause World War I. The war marked the first major victory of a non-western power over a western power. As a result of the failure of the war in Russia, there was considerable discontent at home, and this discontent led to the Revolution of 1905. Finally, as a result of the defeat, Russia turned its interests back to the West and the Balkans.

====The Revolution of 1905====

Under Czar Nicholas II, who ruled from 1896 to 1917, the people believed that &quot;papa czar&quot; could hear their grievances and he would fix them. However, the people soon learned that the czar could not be trusted.

On what has become known as &quot;Bloody Sunday,&quot; June 22, 1905, a peaceful march of thousands of St. Petersburg workers to the Winter Palace by Father Gapon took place. The marchers desired an eight hour work day, the establishment of a minimum wage, and a constitutional assembly. However, the Czar was not in the city, and Russian troops panicked and killed several hundred of the marchers.

As a result of Bloody Sunday, riots erupted throughout the country during 1905. Soviets formed the councils of workers in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Demands for representation increased, and the moral bond between the people and the czar was broken. As a result, the [[w:October Manifesto|October Manifesto]] was granted to stop the disturbances. The October Manifesto provided a constitution, a parliament called the Duma, and some civil liberties. The Duma actually possessed little power, however, and was primarily intended to divide and subdue the revolutionaries.

====Stolypin's Reforms====

Pyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin was appointed minister by the Czar to address the problems of 1905. At Stolypin's recommendation, the czar ended redemption payments by the serfs, increased the power of the zemstvos, and allowed the peasants to own their land outright for the first time. Peasants were now allowed to buy more land to increase their holdings, and were even given loans. In some sense this was a sincere attempt at reform, and it created a new class of prosperous, entrepreneurial peasants called Kulaks. However, for the most part this was again an attempt to subdue revolutionaries, as the ulterior motive of the plan was to create a new class of peasant farmers who would be conservative and loyal to the czar. Under Stolypin's lead, revolutionaries and dissenters were brutally punished in what became known as &quot;Stolypin Neckties.&quot; Stolypin was assassinated in 1911.

==International Relations==

===Imperialism===

In 1871, political stability of European nations resulted in renewed interest in imperialist endeavors. Britain became heavily involved in colonialism. The newly-unified Germany saw expansion as a sign of greatness. France also became involved in imperialist affairs due to foreign competition.

[[Image:The white mans burden.gif|thumb|left|250px|The white man's burden - a satiric take]]

Europe's political, military and economic domination of the world gave birth to the British notion of the [[w:white man's burden|white man's burden]]. The white man's burden held that the white man had an obligation to forcefully spread their ideas and institutions with others. This, of course, was utilized by some European governments as moral justification for their imperialistic foreign policies.

In addition, as a result of European industrialization, nations had an increased need for various resources, such as cotton, rubber, and fuel. Moreover, a high level of nationalism was at the time being experienced across Europe, particularly as a result of Napoleon's Empire. As nationalism grew at home, citizens began to desire more troops for their army, and thus colonies were needed to provide more troops, as well as naval bases and refueling points for ships.

By the late 1800s, a number of nations across Europe possessed new colonial territories. Belgium had taken the Congo in central Africa. France controlled Algeria, and Italy controlled Somalia.

It was said that &quot;The sun never sets on the British Empire.&quot; By this time, Britain's colonial territories spanned the world, and during the late 1800s Britain expanded their territorial possessions to include Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.

In Asia, the British, Dutch and French all established or expanded their colonies.

===Crimean War===

The Crimean War found its roots in the so-called &quot;Eastern Question,&quot; or the question of what to do with the decaying Ottoman Empire.

The Crimean War was provoked by Russian tsar Nicholas I's continuing pressure on the dying Ottoman Empire, and by Russia's claims to be the protector of the Orthodox Christian subjects of the Ottoman sultan.

Britain and France became involved in order to block Russian expansion and prevent Russians from acquiring control of the Turkish Straits and eastern Mediterranean, and to prevent Russia from upsetting the European balance of power.

The Crimean War is considered one of the first &quot;modern&quot; wars and it introduced a number of &quot;firsts&quot; to warfare. The Crimean War marked the first time railroads were used tactically to transport troops and to transport goods to troops over vast distances. The War also marked the first time steam powered ships were used in war. Additionally, new weapons and techniques were used, including breech-loading rifles, which loaded from the rear, artillery, and the deployment of trenches. The telegraph was used for the first time as well, allowing for the first &quot;live&quot; war to be broadcast in the press.

The conflict marked the end of Metternich's Concert of Europe. At the end of the war, Russia was defeated and as a result looked weak. The shock of the defeat in the Crimean War in Russia led to Alexander II enacting sweeping internal reform. Alexander recognized that in order to compete with other nations, it would have to industrialize and modernize. As a step toward this, Alexander liberated the serfs in 1861. Finally, the Ottoman Empire was kept intact, and it would continue to decline until World War I.

==Science and Technology==

===Darwin's Theory of Evolution===

In his book ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'', Charles Darwin (1809-1882) wrote that creatures experience genetic mutations prior to birth. Some of these random mutations are beneficial, and some are not. He wrote that in the world, the creatures who are the &quot;most fit&quot; are most likely to survive and thus pass on their genes. This process, known as [[w:natural selection|natural selection]] results in the strongest creatures thriving and the weak dying off.

One of the most massive results of Darwin's theory of evolution was that it was another major challenge to the Catholic Church. This, coupled with the Reformation, Renaissance, the Enlightenment and its subsequent rise of deism, and other related movements, caused the Church to lose even more influence in society.

Also, Darwin's theory led to the rise of the concept of [[w:social Darwinism|social Darwinism]], or &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; The theory was fathered by Herbert Spencer. Social Darwinism espoused the idea that consensual economic interaction and property rights enabled societies to progress by allowing productive members of society to flourish and unproductive members to be punished by poverty. Accordingly, the theory of social Darwinism had a large impact on classical liberal and libertarian theory. However, in non-libertarian circles, social Darwinism did not enjoy a favorable reputation, as it was perceived to have espoused apologism on behalf of the rich, while condemning the poor.

===New Mental Sciences===
As a result of Darwin's theory, a new group of mental sciences arose. People now began to believe that life is a struggle, and they began to try to explain these struggles. These new mental sciences supported the concepts of real politik and capitalism, and rejected the notion that life is orderly, harmonious, predictable, or reasonable. 

During this time, Sigmund Freud founded what is known as the psychoanalytical school of psychology. He argued that people are not creatures of reason, as the Enlightenment suggested, but rather that people act because of subconscious motivations. He broke these motivations into three areas:

;Id : The id produces unconscious desires and is the most primitive of the three. The id desires instant gratification. Freud argued that people will use defense mechanisms and rationalization to justify acting upon the id.
;Ego :The ego is the reality principle or the conscious self. It attempts to suppress the id and its intense desires.
;Superego : The superego is a person's conscience.

Lombroso argued that you can tell criminals by their appearance. Pavlov argued that people's actions are a response to being conditioned by stimuli in an environment. Finally, Binet devised IQ tests, arguing that intelligence is a measurable quotient. As a result, eugenicists used this to try to prove that some people were more fit to live than others.

==Society and Culture==

The Victorian Age was a period in which appearances were critical to social status. The dominating social class was the middle class, or bourgeosie. High moral standards and strict social codes, especially of etiquette and class status, were followed. This era also saw a middle-class interest in social reform for the lower classes.

Modern life was often unsettling to Europeans, as their old ways were being replaced by urbanization, industrialization, socialism, imperialism, and countless other new &quot;ways.&quot;

The population was rising, with the Agricultural Revolution as well as advances in medicine allowing the citizens to live longer. This resulted in a portion of the rising population migrating to other locations, including emigrating to other nations. Europeans migrated from the country to the city in search of industrial jobs. In addition, many Europeans fled to the United States, South America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for a number of reasons - to escape anti-semitic persecution, to flee the Irish potato famine of 1840, and as a result of a general overcrowding in Italy.

However, at the same time, there were falling birth rates as a result of massive social changes in Europe. Child labor laws were being enacted across the continent, and compulsory education was enacted. Thus, the value of children to families fell since they could not generate income, and the overall cost of having children was now bore much more upon the parents.

White collar workers now arose in society, and Europe saw the entrance of educated females into clerical jobs in business and government. Disposable income became more common, and thus department stores and other similar stores began to open. People spent their extra income on fashion, home furnishings, cameras, and various other items. New leisure activities became popular, including hunting, travelling, and bicycling, as well as team sports, including polo, cricket, and soccer.

===Impressionist Art===

[[Image:Claude Monet-Waterlilies.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[w:Claude Monet|Monet's]] Water Lily Pond (''Le bassin aux Nympheas'') (1889)]]

Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-based artists exhibiting their art publicly in the 1860s. The name of the movement is derived from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satiric review published in Le Charivari.

Radicals in their time, early Impressionists broke the rules of academic painting. They began by giving colours, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing inspiration from the work of painters such as Eugène Delacroix. They also took the act of painting out of the studio and into the world. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes had usually been painted indoors. The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting en plein air. Painting realistic scenes of modern life, they emphasized vivid overall effects rather than details. They used short, &quot;broken&quot; brush strokes of pure and unmixed colour, not smoothly blended, as was customary, in order to achieve the effect of intense colour vibration.

===Post Impressionist Art===

[[Image:VanGogh-starry night.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Vincent van Gogh's ''Starry Night'', June 1889 (The Museum of Modern Art, New York)]]

Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brushstrokes and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

The Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with the triviality of subject matter and the loss of structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward. Georges Seurat and his followers concerned themselves with Pointillism, the systematic use of tiny dots of colour. Paul Cézanne set out to restore a sense of order and structure to painting, to &quot;make of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the museums&quot;. He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the bright fresh colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist Camille Pissarro experimented with Neo-Impressionist ideas between the mid 1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented with what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated Pointillism which he called scientific Impressionism before returning to a purer Impressionism in the last decade of his life. Vincent van Gogh used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his feelings and his state of mind. Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist artists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Younger painters during the 1890s and early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various stylistic categories, such as Fauvism and Cubism.

===Christianity and Religion Questioned===
New scientific theories such as Darwin's Theory of Evolution and Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis threatened traditional values. Historical scholarship, especially archaeology, led to questioning the veracity of the Bible, and philosophers like Marx and Nietzsche cast doubt on the morality of Christianity. Due to government's expanding role in education, organized religion also came under attack from the secular state.

These pressures led Pope Pius IX to put forth the Doctrine of Papal Infallibility. Pope Leo XIII addressed the great social issues of the day, condemning Socialism but urging improvements in labor conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

As a result of German unity and increasing German nationalism, as well as various other causes, Germany began on what Kaiser Wilhelm II called a &quot;new course&quot; to earn its &quot;place in the sun.&quot;  After 1871, Germany's trade and industry increased vigorously, challenging and, in some areas, even exceeding that of Great Britain, until then the premier industrial nation of Europe.  A many-sided rivalry developed between Germany and Britain, intensifying when the sometimes-bellicose Wilhelm II assumed power and began building a strong, ocean-going navy.  

Seeking to balance the rise of German power, Britain and France began to draw closer together diplomatically as the 20th century began.  Germany, meanwhile, had allowed an implicit alliance with Tsarist Russia to lapse, and faced ongoing French resentment over the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which Germany had annexed in 1871.  The perceived danger of &quot;encirclement&quot; by hostile nations began to loom in the minds of German leaders.  These factors together formed some of the tinder which would ignite the outbreak of war in 1914.

It is interesting to note, however, that all the ruling families of Europe were related to each other in some form or fashion. This led to many Europeans feeling that it was a family affair that they had been dragged into and forced to endure.

===The Road to War===

World War One is one of the most hotly contested issues in history; the complexity and number of theorized causes can be a major cause for confusion. One of the main reasons for this complexity is the long period over which this war’s tension built, beginning with the unification of Germany by Bismarck, and escalating from there on. There is no doubt that Germany's misguided foreign policy contributed to the outbreak of war, however the extent to which it contributed is the contended issue. 

Some historians suggest that Germany willed the war and engineered its outbreak, and others even suggest that Germany felt compelled to go to war at that time. However, some suggest that the war was brought about by poor leadership at the time, others argue that the war was brought about by accident - that Europe stumbled into war due to tension between alliance systems. Finally, some historians argue that World War I was the culmination of historical developments in Europe.  This argument states that war was inevitable between Austria and Serbia, that imperial expansion by Russia eastward was also likely to provoke war, and that the French were still furious over their loss of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian war.  

There was certainly  a general rise in nationalism in Europe, which played a major role in the start of the conflict. The war became inevitable when the so-called &quot;blank check&quot; was created when Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph sent a letter to German Kaiser Wilhelm II, asking for German support against Serbia.  Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, Kaiser Wilhelm II's Imperial Chancellor, telegrammed back that Austria-Hungary could rely on Germany to support whatever action was necessary to deal with Serbia.

===The Alliance System===

One factor which helped to escalate the conflict was the alliance system of the late nineteenth century. Although there had always been alliances between different European nations, the diplomatic trend during the nineteenth century was to have secret alliances, committing states to defensive military action. These were encouraged by Bismarck who, in the process of unifying Germany, sought to pacify those surrounding states which might proved hostile. Although Germany had originally allied itself with the empires of Austria and Russia at this time, by the beginning of the twentieth century alliances had shifted. Germany found itself allied with Austria-Hungary and Italy, the so-called &quot;Central Powers&quot;; together the countries formed what was known as the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot;. Meanwhile, France, desperate for allies after the Franco-Prussian war, had cultivated a friendship with Russia. Great Britain, too, felt isolated in the increasingly factionalised European environment, and sought out an alliance with another of Europe's great powers. This led to the Entente Cordial with France, which was to develop into the &quot;Triple Entente&quot; between Britain, France and Russia.

By 1914 most of the smaller European states had been drawn into this web of alliances. Serbia had allied itself with Russia whilst its enemy, Bulgaria, chose the patronage of Germany. A number of small states maintained their neutrality in this complicated network of alliances. Belgium, for instance, was a neutral state, its independence guaranteed by Britain, France, and Germany.

==The War==

===The Schlieffen Plan===

[[Image:Schlieffen Plan.jpg|right|thumb|Map of the Schlieffen Plan and planned French counter-offensives]]

The Schlieffen Plan was designed by Field Marshall Count Alfred von Schlieffen, who became Chief of the Great General Staff in 1891 and submitted his plan in 1905.  Out of fear of a two front war, which Germany was nearly certain it could not win, it devised the plan to eliminate one of the fronts of the war before the other side could prepare.  The plan called for a rapid German mobilization, sweeping through Holland, Luxembourg and Belgium into France.  Schlieffen called for overwhelming numbers on the far right flank, the northernmost spearhead of the force with only minimum troops making up the arm and axis of the formation as well as a minimum force stationed on the Russian eastern front.  Swift elimination of the French threat would in theory allow Germany to better defend against a Russian, or a British force.  However, the British involvement was not looked for under the Schlieffen plan, not at the commencement of action at least.&lt;br&gt;
In 1905 Count Schlieffen expected his overpowering right wing to move basically along the coast through Holland.  He expected the Dutch to acquiesce and grant the army the right to cross their borders.  Schlieffen knew that navigating around the Belgian fortress at Liege in this way would speed the advance while still defeating the fortress simply by encirclement.  Schlieffen retired from his post in 1906 and was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke.  In 1907-08 Moltke adjusted the plan, reducing the proportional distribution of the forces, lessening the crucial right wing in favor of a slightly more defensive strategy.  Also, judging Holland as unlikely to grant permission to cross its borders the plan now called for a direct move through Belgium but expected the French force to officially invade neutral Belgium first in an attempt to take the advantageous position at Meuse.  Moltke's variation called for an artillery assault on Liege, but with the rail lines and the unprecedented firepower the German army brought what he did not expect any significant defense of the fortress.

===August 1914: War Erupts===

On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austria-Hungary throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo.  As a result, Austria declared war on Serbia.  Germany declared war on both Russia and France.  On August 4, Germany invaded neutral Belgium before the French.  This precipitated in Great Britain's declaration of war on Germany.

Enacting the Moltke variation of the Schlieffen Plan, German forces entered Belgium, attacking the fortress of Liege.  Although they could not stop the large invading force, Belgian troops fought bravely, and the siege lasted 10 days, arguably upsetting the German timetable and allowing for mobilization of the French and the British Expeditionary forces.  During the second half of August, however, a hasty French counteroffensive in Lorraine collapsed, with heavy casualties in the face of German machine-gun fire.  French armies fell back in disarray as the Germans crossed from Belgium into France on a wide front.

Keeping its alliance with France, Russia's armies invaded Germany's easternmost province, East Prussia, in August.  The German high command dispatched General Paul von Hindenburg to defend the province.  Hindenburg took command and defeated the Russians at the Battle of Tannenberg, ending the hope of a Russian advance to Berlin.

The end of August was marked by near-panic in northern France as the German offensive rolled south toward Paris, seemingly unstoppable.  On the German side, however, a gap developed between the westernmost army corps, and the rapid advance was exhausting the troops.  The French rushed reinforcements from Paris -- some in taxicabs -- to the front, and by the first week of September, amid heavy fighting, the Germans had been halted along the River Marne.  This marked the beginning of the static trench lines which would define the front in Western Europe for four years.

===1915-1916===

On February 4, 1915, Germany declared a submarine blockade of Great Britain, stating that any ship approaching England was a legitimate target.  On May 7, 1915, Germany sank the  passenger ship Lusitania, resulting in a massive uproar in the United States, as over 100 U.S. citizens perished.  On August 30, Germany responded by ceasing to sink ships without warning.

The front in France became the focus of mass attacks that cost huge numbers of lives, but gained very little.  Britain became fully engaged in France, raising a large conscript army for the first time in its history.  1915 saw the first attacks with chlorine gas by the Germans, and soon the Allies responded in kind.  During much of the year 1916, the longest battle of the war, the Battle of Verdun, a German offensive against France and Britain, was fought to a draw and resulted in an estimated one million casualties.  On July 1 through November 18, the Battle of Somme, a British and French offensive against the Germans, again resulted in approximately one million casualties but no breakthrough for either side.

===1917-1918: Final Phases===

On February 1, 1917, Germany again declares unrestricted submarine warfare.  The Germans believed that it was possible to defeat the British in six months through this, and assumed it would take at least one year for America to mobilize as a result of the actions.  Thus, they banked on the hope that they could defeat Britain before America would enter the war.  

A mood of cultural despair had settled over much of Europe by this time, as an entire generation of young men was fed into the maw of combat.  French armies came close to mutiny in 1917 when ordered into an attack they knew would be hopeless.  Germany, blockaded from overseas trade, saw hunger and deprivation among the population, with labor strikes and political discontent growing.  Russia underwent collapse, its armies defeated and the Tsar ousted in favor of a liberal-socialist regime.

On April 6, 1917, the United States entered the war by declaring war on Germany. This was in part due to the sinking of the Lusitania and the Zimmerman Telegram, which was a ploy to convince Mexico to attack the United States in exchange for the return of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona should the United States enter the war.  From July 31 through November 10, 1917, the Third Battle of Ypres, also known as Passchendaele, resulted in minor gains for the British, but there was still no breakthrough of the well-developed German defenses.  During this time, on November 7, Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, overthrew the post-Tsar Russian government.

As a result, in March 1918, the new Russian government, represented by Leon Trotsky, signed an armistice treaty with Germany, removing the eastern front of the war for Germany.  On March 21, Germany thus launched what is known as the Ludendorff offensive in the hope of winning the war before American troops arrived.  The final German effort, however, fared no better in the end than the previous ones; the Germans pushed closer to Paris than ever before, but by the end of summer they had exhausted themselves against the Allied defenses, now including fresh American armies.

On September 29, 1918, allied troops broke through the German fortifications at the Hindenberg line, and the end of the war came into view.  On November 9, 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated, and on November 10 the German Weimar Republic was founded.  On November 11, 1918, at eleven o'clock on the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, the war ended as Germany and the Allies signed an armistice agreement.

===The War in Italy===
[[Image:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|upright|Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol]]
Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in Province of Trento, Istria and Dalmatia. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance. At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature, and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the Alpine province of South Tyrol and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary.  This was formalised by the Treaty of London.  Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on May 23. Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany.

Militarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. This advantage, however, was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. Field Marshal Luigi Cadorna, a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking Ljubljana and threatening Vienna. It was a Napoleonic plan, which had no realistic chance of success in an age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and mountainous terrain.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian Kaiserschützen and Standschützen engaged Italian Alpini in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counter-attacked in the Asiago towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916, but made little progress.

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the Isonzo front along the Isonzo River, north-east of Trieste. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of Gorizia. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austrians received large numbers of reinforcements, including German Stormtroopers and the elite Alpenkorps. The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved a victory at Caporetto. The Italian army was routed and retreated more than 100&amp;nbsp;km (60&amp;nbsp;miles) to reorganise, stabilizing the front at the Piave River. Since in the Battle of Caporetto Italian Army had heavy losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so called '''99 Boys'' (Ragazzi del '99), that is, all males who were 18 years old. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through, in a series of battles on the Asiago Plateau, finally being decisively defeated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in October of that year. Austria-Hungary surrendered in early November 1918.&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/isonzo.htm  |publisher=FirstWorldWar.com|title=The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{citation|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/maps/italianfront.htm  |publisher=FirstWorldWar.com|title=Battlefield Maps: Italian Front}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hickey|2003|pp=60-65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The War at Sea===
[[Image:Hochseeflotte 2.jpg|thumb||250px|A battleship squadron of the Hochseeflotte at sea]]
At the start of the war, the German Empire had cruisers scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser SMS Emden, part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, the bulk of the German East Asia Squadron — consisting of the armoured cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau, light cruisers SMS Nürnberg and SMS Leipzig and two transport ships — did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it encountered elements of the British fleet. The German flotilla, along with SMS Dresden, sank two armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel, but was almost completely destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the Battle of Más a Tierra these too were destroyed or interned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor2007|pp=39–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-313-33181-2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Keene|2006|pp=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-85728-498-4&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Halpern|1995|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8476-9645-6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zieger|2001|pp=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1916 Battle of Jutland (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or &quot;Battle of the Skagerrak&quot;) developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war. It took place on 31 May&amp;ndash;1 June 1916, in the North Sea off Jutland. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, squared off against the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, led by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The engagement was a standoff, as the Germans, outmaneuvered by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.

German U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/History/h_AtlWar.html|title=Coast Guard in the North Atlantic War|accessdate=2007-10-30|work=}}{{dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8050-7617-4&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Gilbert|2004|pp=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States launched a protest, and Germany modified its rules of engagement. After the notorious sinking of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the &quot;cruiser rules&quot; which demanded warning and placing crews in &quot;a place of safety&quot; (a standard which lifeboats did not meet).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von der Porten|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, realizing the Americans would eventually enter the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8420-2918-4&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Jones|year=2001|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U.S. could transport a large army overseas.

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships entered convoys escorted by destroyers. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the introduction of hydrophone and depth charges, accompanying destroyers might actually attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. The convoy system slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was a massive program to build new freighters. Troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/hansard//comm/va/va_2006nov09.htm |title= Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs |accessdate=2007-10-30|work=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pahh.com/oss/pt3/p23.html |title=Greek American Operational Group OSS, Part 3 continued |accessdate=2007-10-30 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-boats had sunk almost 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 178 submarines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uboat.net/history/wwi/part6.htm The U-boat War in World War One]&lt;/ref&gt; 

World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with HMS Furious launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918, as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and Technology==
===New Military Techniques and Technologies===

[[Image:WW1 TitlePicture For Wikipedia Article.jpg|left|thumb|200px|'''Clockwise from top''': Trenches on the Western Front; a British Mark I Tank crossing a trench; Royal Navy battleship HMS ''Irresistible'' sinking after striking a mine at the Battle of the Dardanelles; a Vickers machine gun crew with gas masks and a Sopwith Camel]]

World War I introduced the first time that total war was employed - that is, the full mobilization of society occurred in participant nations.  In addition, it marked the end of war as a &quot;glamorous occupation,&quot; showing how brutal and horrifying war could be when fought by industrial nations with mass production of weapons, and mass armies drawn from whole populations.  

World War I introduced a number of new technologies and techniques.  The outbreak of war took the world from the age of coal to an age where energy was largely derived from petroleum, a much higher-grade fuel source used in many new fighting machines and transport systems on land and sea.  The deadliest product of this new industry was chemical warfare, with countless fighting men suffering and dying in gas attacks.  Submarines also were used with effect, leading to the advent of depth charges and sonar.  Rudimentary tanks and mechanized warfare also entered the battlefield near the end of the war.   Finally, the machine gun took its toll for the first time in World War I.  All this was aimed at breakthrough in trench warfare, in which both sides would dig deep trenches, and attempt to attack the other side, most often with little or no success.    

==Society and Culture==

===The Russian Revolution===

The Russian Revolution marked the first outbreak of communism in Europe.  Contrary to popular belief, however, there were in fact two specific and unique revolutions that took place during 1917 - a true Marxist revolution as well as a revolution led by Lenin that was not a true Marxist revolution.

====March Revolution of 1917====

The peasants were unhappy with the czar as a result of losses from World War I, the lack of real representation and the czar's dismissal of the Duma, the influence of Rasputin upon Alexandra, hunger, food shortages, and industrial working conditions.

As a result, on March 8, 1917, food riots broke out in St. Petersburg; however, the soldiers refused to fire upon the rioters.  At this time, two forces were in competition for control of the revolution.  Members of the Duma executive committee called for a moderate constitutional government, while Soviets, members of worker councils, pushed for revolution and industrial reform.

On March 15, 1917, the Czar attempted to return to Russia by train, but was stopped by the troops and was forced to abdicate.

From March through November, a provisional government was led by Alexander Kerensky, a socialist, and Prince Lvov.  However, this government was destined to fail because it took no action in land distribution, continued to fight in World War I, and failed to fix food shortages.  General Kornilov attempted a coup, but Kerensky used the Soviets and Bolsheviks to put down the coup.  However, this action showed the weakness of Kerensky.

The March Revolution marked the first time that the class struggle predicted by Karl Marx took place.  Thus, the March Revolution was a true Marxist revolution based upon the theories of Marx in ''The Communist Manifesto''.

==== November Revolution of 1917 ====

[[Image:Lenin loc ggbain.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Vladimir Lenin]]

Vladimir Lenin realized that the time had come to seize the revolution.  He authored the &quot;April Theses,&quot; in which he promised peace with the Central Powers, redistribution of the land, transfer of the factories to the owners, and the recognition of the Soviets as the supreme power in Russia.  In this sense, the November Revolution was led by Lenin rather than being an overall coup by the workers, and thus the November revolution cannot be dubbed a true Marxist revolution.

The Revolution may never have happened had not the Prime Minister of the Time, [[w:Aleksandr Kerensky|Aleksandr Kerensky]], destroyed the power of authority within the Army and Navy by allowing the Bolshevik and Menshevik committees greater powers. Kerensky effectively disarmed the Man who could have prevented the Revolution ever happening. The man in question, was the Commander-in-Chief, General [[w:Lavr Kornilov|Lavr Kornilov]] who attempted to bring to heel the populist Government of Kerensky and instill some authority back in to the state and the Army. Kerensky seized the opportunity to relieve Kornilov of his office and effectively gave the Bolsheviks, namely the Red Guard within the ranks of the Petrograd sailors, a ''Carte Blanc'' to take up arms in the so called defense of the Provisional Government. The Army lost its Commander and the streets were handed over to the Bolsheviks.

In March 1918 Lenin established the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat,&quot; adopted the name &quot;Communist Party,&quot; and signed the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, withdrawing Russia from World War I.

Civil war raged in Russia from 1918 until 1922, pitting the Reds (Bolsheviks led by Trotsky) against the Whites, which consisted of czarists, liberals, the bourgeois, Mensheviks, the U.S., Britain, and France.

The victorious Bolsheviks acted to eliminate their opposition using secret police groups such as the Cheka, the NKVD, and the KGB.  Lenin attempted to maintain Marxism, hoping to reach Marx's state of a propertyless, classless utopia.  However, the pursuit of communism generally failed and the economy declined.  Accordingly, Lenin enacted the New Economic Policy in March 1921, which compromised many aspects of communism for capitalism's profits.

===Modern Art===



The 1900s led to the creation of the new, modern art movement.  Fauvism is a type of modern art that emphasized wild, extreme colors, abstraction, simplified lines, freshness, and spontaneity.  Cubism is another form of modern art, which utilizes a geometrical depiction of subjects with planes and angles.  The modern art movement arose because, with the advent of photography, art subjects no longer needed to be a realistic portrayal.

Perhaps the most famous modern artist is Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter and sculptor.

'''Prekmurska Gibanica''' is a cake similar to [[Cookbook:Strudel|Strudel]], with poppy seeds, curd cheese, walnuts and apples. It is a national specialty of Slovenia.

==Ingredients==

*A fireproof earthenware baking mould (preferably round, diameter 32 to 35 cm, height 7 to 9 cm).
*To pour on: 70 cl sour cream and 2 eggs or 3 egg yolks, mixed well
*To sprinkle on: 250 g butter 
 
===Strudel dough===
*500 g flour
*40 g sunflower seed oil
*20 to 30 cl lukewarm water
*salt

===Short pastry dough (base)=== 
*150 g flour
*100 g fat (butter or margarine)
*1 egg yolk, 50 g icing sugar
*1 pack of vanilla sugar

===Walnut filling===
*250 g ground walnuts
*80 g sugar, some cinnamon
*grated lemon peel

===Curd cheese filling=== 
*1000 g full-fat curd cheese
*1 egg
*80 g raisins
*100 g sugar
*salt
*1 pack vanilla sugar

===Poppy seed filling===
*150 g ground poppy seeds
*80 g sugar
*some cinnamon
*grated lemon peel

===Apple filling===
*1 kg apples
*100 g sugar
*some cinnamon 

==Procedure==
===Strudel dough===
#Sift the flour onto a working surface, make a well in the middle, add a pinch of salt, oil and water, mix everything together and knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. 
#Shape the dough into a ball, coat with oil, cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes on a floured board.

===Short pastry dough=== 
#Sift the flour onto a working surface, press a well in the middle, add knobs of butter, sugar, egg yolk and vanilla sugar, and knead together quickly. 

===Walnut filling===
#Thoroughly mix ground walnuts, sugar, vanilla sugar and cinnamon. 

===Curd cheese filling===
#Mash the curd cheese, thoroughly mix the egg, vanilla sugar, sugar, some salt and grated lemon peel until the filling spreads nicely. 
#Add washed raisins that have been softened in rum.

===Poppy seed filling===
#Thoroughly mix ground poppy seeds, sugar, vanilla sugar, cinnamon and grated lemon peel.

===Apple filling=== 
#Peel the apples, slice them and mix them with sugar and cinnamon. 

==Procedure==
#Grease the baking mould well, roll out the short pastry dough and line the base of the baking mould with it, then prick it gently with a fork. 
#Stretch the strudel dough and coat it with oil. 
#Pull it thinly over the baking mould so that the thick edges hang down over the mould. Cut off the edges to make 8 equal-sized sheets of strudel dough. 
#Place the first sheet of strudel dough on the short pastry dough, coat with poppy seed filling and sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. 
#Then place the second sheet of strudel pastry on top, coat with curd cheese filling and sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. 
#Cover with the next sheet of strudel dough, coat with walnut filling and again sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. 
#Coat the fourth sheet of strudel dough with the apple filling and sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. The Gibanica is now half-assembled. 
#Repeat steps 4 through 7 until you end up with 8 uniform layers. 
#Finally, cover with a sheet of strudel dough and pull it over the edge of the baking mould, then sprinkle with butter and cream. 
#Prick the Gibanica with a long needle again. Bake in a pre-heated oven or bread oven at 175°C for about 75 minutes. 
#Coat with sour cream and allow it to cool a little
#Cut into triangles, sprinkle with icing sugar and serve. 

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* You can also assemble the individual layers of the Prekmurska Gibanica in a different order. The only important point is that moist (curd cheese, apple) and drier (poppy seed, walnut) fillings should alternate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Antipyretic is medication used to lower body temperature when a fever is present.  

Examples: Aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen, and others.

Clinicians practicing allopathic medicine (the predominant form of medicine practiced in the US by MD's, DO's, etc) see tremendous value in the reduction of a patient's temperature when it is over 100.5 degrees Farenheit. Body temperatures higher than that will likely cause aching of muscles, increased metabolism, lack of appetite, inability to ingest enough liquids, etc./ A fever higher than 104 degrees in a child may cause seizure activity, which can lead to death. Prolonged fever higher than 105 can cause permanent brain damage or death. 

Many people try to bring their temperature down without the use of medications. Within limits, this is worth trying. Things that are dangerous include: using alcohol on the skin (which causes a cool sensation, but closes the blood vessels that are close to the skin, thereby actually raising body temperature); use of ice, which may also close the blood vessels on the skin, making things worse. The best way to start lowering temperature is to take off most clothing and dampen the skin with water that is neither hot nor cold, usually called &quot;tepid&quot;. As it evaporates, it takes a lot of heat away from the skin.

Children under 12 should not be given Aspirin if there is any possibility of Chicken pox, as there can result a more serious illness. Tylenol can alternate every 2 hours with ibuprofen if necessary, but as noted above, keeping the child in normal bedclothes, or under blankets while feverish, will only maintain the high temperature and work against the medication.  

People who practice homeopathic medicine believe the body's response with a fever is somehow helping the patient overcome the illness. This is not the predominant view in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''An analgesic is a medicine used to relieve pain.''' The body of analgesic knowledge is vast and complex. Morever it is ever changing with an increasing array of new molecules and drugs.

'''Examples of Analgesics:'''


'''1. Flexin Continus tablets '''
Useful in Osteoarthritis and Painful Musculoskeletal disorders

'''2. Codafen Continus tablets '''
Useful in Dental pain, post-operative pain, dysmenorrhea


Pain relief has traditionally relied on three main groups of drugs: 
*Opioids, which reduce pain awareness in the brain, but don't change the pain
*Local anaesthetics, which confuse the nerves sending pain signals to the brain
*Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which reduce the inflammation **which leads to pain

Researchers continue to search for new ways of using these traditional drugs. 
(a) Varying the routes of administration.
*The oral route is the most common, but means the medication has to be swallowed, absorbed into the body, and pass the liver before it can work. 
*Transdermal Opioids (putting cream or patches on the skin) is an advantage for continuous pain treatment, like cancer pain or severe arthritis, and one formulation may last 72-80 hours, reducing medication administration errors and side effects
*Injectable pain medication is frequently used for areas that allow surgery or other pain relief when the entire body does not need to be involved, like fixing a tooth at the dentist, or sewing a laceration closed on an arm.

(b) Use of some different delivery formulations.
(c) Changing the species to which they may be given.

Research has also brought in various new compounds offer improved pain relief and reduction in side effects.

==Instructions for Authors==

'''See [[Radiation Oncology/Standards | a list of standards]] for this wikibook.'''

==Template Usage==
*Template for Table of Contents '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
:Prior versions used &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Radiation Oncology:TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The above version, which uses the Template namespace (Template/Radiation Oncology:TOC) is preferred.
*Add link to edit a template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Radiation Oncology:Template Edit|''page name''|''text''}}
**where ''page name'' is the module name alone without the name space, such that http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Radiation_Oncology:Introduction would be ''Introduction''.
**where ''text'' is the text you want to appear after the word Edit in the box, such as &quot;Edit this&quot;, or &quot;Edit Table of Contents&quot;
:&amp;mdash;[[User:Brim|Brim]] 01:35, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)

==Listing of templates==
To see a list of templates used in the Radiation Oncology wiki, use [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Radiation+Oncology&amp;namespace=10 this link].
:''Note:'' older templates used the naming scheme Radiation Oncology/''subject'':TOC or Radiation Oncology/''subject''/TOC. Not all have been moved to the Template namespace.

A partial listing of older templates is below:

Note: all are preceded by a colon, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Radiation Oncology:TOC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*Radiation Oncology:TOC - general table of contents header
*Radiation Oncology:Colorectal_staging - common staging used for colon/rectum/small bowel
*Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Node staging
*Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Stage grouping

Sections with table of contents templates:
*Radiation Oncology/Prostate:TOC - table of contents header for prostate
*Radiation Oncology/Breast:TOC
*Radiation Oncology/NHL:TOC - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
*Radiation Oncology/Hodgkin/TOC - Hodgkin's lymphoma
*Radiation Oncology/Lung/NSCLC:TOC - Non-small cell lung
*Radiation Oncology/Lung/SCLC:TOC - Small cell lung
*Radiation Oncology/Thyroid:TOC - Thyroid

It's suggested that you add the link '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Radiation Oncology:Template Edit|Radiation Oncology/Prostate:TOC|the prostate table of contents bar}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to the top of a main page for a section (i.e. Prostate) that has subpages that use a table of contents template specific for that section.  This will allow easy editing of the table of contents bar so it can be kept in sync with the section main page.

To make creating table of contents pages for subpages easier, you can copy fill-in-the-blank templates using the substitute command '''subst:'''.  
*For the main page for a section, use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst::Radiation Oncology:TOC1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
*For the table of contents bar for a section, use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst::Radiation Oncology:TOC2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

:Example:
Let's say you wanted to create a section called &quot;Earlobe tumors&quot; which was large enough that you needed multiple subpages.  
#Create the page &quot;Radiation Oncology/Earlobe tumors&quot;.
#Type '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst::Radiation Oncology:TOC1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and save the page.
#Edit the page, replacing the ___INSERT TEXT HERE___ as appropriate, create the subsections that you would like, and save the page.
#Now edit the table of contents bar for this section (Radiation Oncology/Earlobe tumors:TOC), which you can do by following the link &quot;edit the ___ table of contents bar.&quot;
#Type '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst::Radiation Oncology:TOC2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and save the page.
#Edit the page.

==Table example==
{|border=1
|+'''FLIPI'''
!colspan=2|Risk Factors: Five factors calculate FLIPI risk
|-
|1. Age &gt; 60 years||'''low risk'''
|-
|2. Ann Arbor stage III-IV||0-1 factors
|-
|3. Hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL||'''intermediate risk'''
|-
|4. Number of nodal areas &gt; 5||2 factors
|-
|5. LDH &gt; normal limits||'''high risk'''
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||3+ factors
|}

== Footnotes ==
Recommend the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' method of generating footnotes and references.  Please see guidelines at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes Footnotes].  

Example:
&lt;br&gt;in text:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insert reference here&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;Insert reference here&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple/&quot;&gt; (to insert another instance of the same reference)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;br&gt;insert a Notes or References section at the bottom of the page:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You are also encouraged to use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Footnotes|100%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' which inserts the following text
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how 
 to generate footnotes using the   &lt;ref(erences/)&gt; tags--&gt;
 &lt;references/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Talk section ==

Brim, 

Hope here.  

Just wondering if you mind significant contributions... I already have a WikiWiki internally that has a large quantity of site-specific information, which I've been updating for ~1 year.  It's not advertised and WikiBooks might be the way to go for a generalized resource.  Any concerns about merging the two over time?

Also, what is the goal of this Wiki?  Comprehensive text with everything (a la Perez) or more focused on specifics relating to evidence based treatment?

[[Hope]]

:Hi Hope. Welcome aboard and thank you for your contributions so far to the Radiation Oncology Wikibook.  

Ideally and eventually this should be a comprehensive text, but the main [[radiation Oncology/Introduction|goal]] is ease of use.  I'd rather the text be easy to read (bullet points) rather than have lengthy paragraphs, so in that regard it would be different from major print textbooks.  

Really I see its main utility as being a repository of important radiation oncology articles, which would make it useful as a study guide for boards.  I think it's important to give full citations for all articles mentioned.  Now Wikipedia and Wikibooks both support links to PubMed by using the syntax '''&lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 12829145&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' which produces the result PMID 12829145.  I've been inconsistent with how I've been formatting articles, but you can look some of the chapters in the book to see in general how I've been formatting them.  Once the book grows, there should probably be some policy on a recommended format.

In addition to listing the results of key articles, I would eventually like it to include treatment recommendations (i.e. how to treat advanced breast cancer) and radiation techniques (with pictures).  I've also put Radiation Biology and Radiation Physics on the table of contents listing so that they may also be added at some time.

Since the project is still in its very early stages, how it develops exactly remains to be seen.  

What I would definitely like to avoid is having it become like the oncology-related articles on [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] which are written very simply in layman's terms and read like general interest newspaper articles.  The scope of this text should be for the cancer specialist.

I would really welcome any contributions you can make to this project.  It would be great to try to merge your previous WikiWiki work over to here.  Just be careful about copyright since Wikibooks requires that its articles be licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.  In the spirit of Wiki, [[w:be bold|be bold]] and if you see a way that this book needs to be changed, go for it, or ask me on my [[User_talk:Brim|talk page]].

Once again, welcome.  By the way, do you also contribute on Wikipedia?

:&amp;mdash;[[User:Brim|Brim]] 16:36, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

P.S. Say hello to Kat for me.

---

I'll let Cat know you said hello.  

Basically, it sounds like this wikiwiki is similar in many ways to the wikiwiki I already have going.  I will probably start shifting some of the content over as I can.  I'll probably maintain both for a while, just to see how this one goes.

I haven't submitted much to Wikipedia, mostly because nothing has really struck my fancy there.

I'm on Pediatrics right now, so I'll probably start with that for the next few articles.

[[Hope]]

I just noticed you (Brim) wrote &quot;Really I see its main utility as being a repository of important radiation oncology articles, which would make it useful as a study guide for boards.&quot; To what depth should these pages go? Would you want to keep it to just randomized evidence if available, or major studies? Or to whatever depth one has interest of entering information? As an example, I have done a project looking at predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, so I have somewhere all the studies that have developed predictive models. I could write it up as a subarticle. Or just add the 2-3 major prognostic models. [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 17:00, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
*I think the general rule should be that good quality articles (i.e. randomized control trials) are preferred, but that any article that is valuable or of historical interest can or should be included.  Often, there are major important articles that are retrospective studies.  These may be followed then by data from randomized studies.  If a non-randomized article is important for historical reasons or otherwise, it should be included.   The main obstacle we should avoid is to have this wikibook get bogged down with too much information.  The wiki shouldn't be a list of &quot;all articles about prostate cancer.&quot;  That would defeat its purpose of being an easy-to-use reference.  I guess for now, with the wiki being in its relatively early stages, it would be better to err on the side of including articles that you think are important.  Later, as the wiki grows, we may need to eliminate some redundant articles.  Since we're not limited by space as we would be in a print textbook, we may elect to just move less-important artices to subpages of the main article (i.e. a page called &quot;other prostate articles&quot;) while keeping the important articles in easy-to-find places.  As for your idea about the predictive models after RP, there might be enough information for that all to go on its own page.  You could list the 2-3 major prognostic models at the top so they're easier to spot.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 02:57, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Is it a coincidence that the rad onc page seems to be the most comprehensive of any of the medical specialties on Wiki?
:no, i think we have the most computer time during the work day

It seems that the [[Radiation_Oncology#Treatment_toxicity|Treatment Toxicity]] and the [[Radiation_Oncology#Supportive_Care|Supportive Care]] sections have a fair amount of overlap. I wonder what's the best way of handling it? I am thinking of combining them under each organ, and then having 3 sections - tolerance, acute toxicity &amp; treatment, and long-term toxicity &amp; treatment. --[[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 02:21, 7 August 2007 (UTC)
:I think the '''treatment toxicity''' section should be concerned with the risks of radiation complications and treatment planning aspects.  For instance, data on esophagitis, data on lung V20, genitourinary toxicity, rectal tolerance, etc.  It's more academic in scope, like the chapters on treatment.  On the other hand '''Supportive Care''' is more of a field guide on how to deal with toxicities when they occur: a listing of helpful medicines and treatments, etc., that you can turn to as a handy reference.  I think   the sections function better separately since they're not commonly used together; but it would be helpful to have hyperlinks between related section.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Myturn. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Myturn~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[Image:Cooked mussels DSC09244.JPG|thumb|right|Cooked mussels]]
Mussels are bivalve shellfish that can be found in lakes, rivers, creeks, intertidal areas, and throughout the ocean. The saltwater mussels (family Mytilidae) and freshwater mussels (family Unionidae) are not thought to be closely related despite considerable similarities in appearance.  Mussels are filter feeders, and tend to absorb any toxic chemicals and pollutants from the water pumped through them.
For cooking purposes:
* mollusks deteriorate rapidly and if not cooked right away may lead to infections in the mollusk tissues
*Make sure that the lake or river source of the mussels is not polluted and that the mussels are not diseased.
* to test a mussel for freshness, try sliding the two halves of the shell across each other. If they move at all, then the shell is probably filled with mud
* wash mussels by agitating them in a colander with running cold water
* scrub mussel shells with a stiff brush
* mussels may be steamed, removed from the shell, or served in the shell with or without sauce.

To avoid danger of food poisoning, when cooking mussels the following two &quot;chef's rules&quot; should always be adhered to:
* before cooking, discard any mussels where the shells are open (including those which are cracked)
* and discard any mussels which did not open during cooking (in other words, if the're still closed after cooking - get rid of them).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Note: You should know SQL to use mySQL. You can learn that in the [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] book.

PHP integrates well with mySQL, and contains a library full of useful functions to help you use mySQL.
There are even many [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database database] managers written in PHP.

mySQL is not a part of the server that runs PHP, it is a different server. mySQL is one of many database servers, it is open source and you can get it [http://www.mysql.com here].

As of PHP5, mySQL integration is not enabled by default and you should add it manually, see [http://il.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php here] for installation instructions, PHP4 has it enabled by default.

Let's get started!

==Connecting to a mySQL server==

To connect with a mySQL server, you should use the mysql_connect() function.
It is used in the following manner:

 mysql_connect(servername, username, password);

''servername'' - The name or address of the server. Usually 'localhost'.
''username'', ''password'' - The username and password used to login to the server.

===Multiple mySQL connections===

Though not commonly used, you can connect to more than one database server in one script.
On a successful connection, ''mysql_connect()'' returns a reference to the server, which you can capture with a variable:

 $con = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;123&quot;);
 $con2 = mysql_connect(&quot;http://www.example.com/&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;123&quot;);

===Selecting your database===

In order to perform most actions(except for creating, dropping and listing databases, of course), you must select a database.
To do so, use ''mysql_select_db()''.

 mysql_select_db(db_name);

Where db_name is the database name.

By default, ''mysql_select_db()'' will try to select the database on the last mySQL connection opened. So in the following code, ''mysql_select_db()'' will try to select the database on the &quot;example.com&quot; server.

 $con = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;123&quot;);
 $con2 = mysql_connect(&quot;example.com:3306&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;123&quot;);
 mysql_select_db(&quot;database1&quot;);

The function takes a second, optional, parameter that you can use to select a different database then the one last opened:

 $con = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;123&quot;);
 $con2 = mysql_connect(&quot;example.com:3306&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;123&quot;);
 mysql_select_db(&quot;database1&quot;, $con);

==Executing a query==

To execute a query, use ''mysql_query()''. For example:

 mysql_query(&quot;UPDATE table1 SET column1='value1', column2='value2' WHERE column3='value3'&quot;);

By default, ''mysql_query()'' will use the last mySQL connection opened, if you want to use a specific connection, send it to the function as a second parameter:

 mysql_query(&quot;UPDATE table1 SET column1='value1', column2='value2' WHERE column3='value3'&quot;, $con);

'''Important:''' mysql_query() returns a resource link which you ''will'' need for certain operations. So you should capture it by storing the result in a variable:

 $query1 = mysql_query(&quot;UPDATE table1 SET column1='value1', column2='value2' WHERE column3='value3'&quot;, $con);

===Functions for SELECT queries===

Executing a SELECT query is all good and well, but just sometimes, we may want the result (people are strange like that). The PHP developers are those strange people, and they added to PHP a few functions to help up with that:

====mysql_fetch_row()====

Returns the next row in the result.
It is returned as an array, so you should capture it in a variable.

For example:

 $query1 = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, name, address FROM phone_book&quot;);
 
 $person = mysql_fetch_row($query1);
 
 print_r($person);

This should output something like this:

 Array
 {
     [0] =&gt; 1
     [1] =&gt; Sharon
     [2] =&gt; Helm, 3
 }

This function will always return the next row in the result, until eventually it runs out of rows and it returns ''false''.
A very common use of this function is with a ''while'' loop, for example:

 $query1 = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, name, address FROM phone_book&quot;);
 
 while($person = mysql_fetch_row($query1))
 { 
     print_r($person);
     echo &quot;\n&quot;;
 }

This should output something like this:

 Array
 {
     [0] =&gt; 1
     [1] =&gt; Sharon
     [2] =&gt; Helm, 3
 }
 Array
 {
     [0] =&gt; 2
     [1] =&gt; Adam
     [2] =&gt; 23rd street, 5
 }
 Array
 {
     [0] =&gt; 3
     [1] =&gt; Jane
     [2] =&gt; Unknown
 }

====mysql_fetch_array()====

This one does exactly what ''mysql_fetch_row()'' does, except for the fact it returns an associative array.

 $query1 = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, name, address FROM phone_book&quot;);
 
 $person = mysql_fetch_array($query1);
 
 print_r($person);

Should output something like this:

 Array
 {
     [id] =&gt; 1
     [name] =&gt; Sharon
     [address] =&gt; Helm, 3
 }

====mysql_num_rows()====

Sometimes we want to know how many rows we get in the result of a query.
This can be done by something like this:

 $counter = 0;
 $query1 = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, name, address FROM phone_book&quot;);
 
 while(mysql_fetch_row($query1))
 {
     $counter++;
 }

''$counter'' now stores the amount of rows we got from the query, but PHP has a special function to handle this:

 $query1 = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, name, address FROM phone_book&quot;); 
 $counter = mysql_num_rows($query1);

''$counter'' stores the same value, but wasn't that easier?

===Functions for other queries===

The following functions are not just for SELECT queries, but for many types of queries. Those queries can be useful in many cases.

====mysql_info()====

Will return information about the last query executed, or about the query you send it a resource of:

 mysql_info();    //For the last query executed
 mysql_info($query); //For $query, what ever that is...

The information is returned as string, and though it's templated, it's not normally to be analyzed by the script, but to be used in output.

====mysql_affected_rows()====

Returns the number of rows affected by a query, only works with INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries:

 mysql_affected_rows();       //For the last query executed
 mysql_affected_rows($query); //For $query, what ever that is

====mysql_insert_id()====

Returns the id mysql assigned to the auto_increment column of the table after an INSERT query.

 $result = mysql_query(&quot;INSERT 'Bob' INTO names(firstname)&quot;);
 $new_id = mysql_insert_id();

''Note: You should call mysql_insert_id() straight after performing the query. If another statement is issued in between mysql_insert_id() will return NULL!''

==Closing a connection==

You should use ''mysql_close()'' to close a mySQL connection.
This would typically close the last connection opened, but, of course, you can send it a connection identifier.

 mysql_close();  //Close the last connection opened
 mysql_close($con); //Close connection $con

This is a recipe for the original Bahian ''Moqueca de Peixe''. To prepare moqueca for 5 people, you will need:

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] of fresh (white) [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] (just try coal fish in the beginning), cut into two-finger wide stripes/slices
* the [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice of one lemon]]
* 2 mid-sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], cut into circular slices
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]] (one red, one green), cut into circular slices
* 1 clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], squeezed
* 4 ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped, optionally skinned
* 4 [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] stems with leaves, finely chopped
* 12 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] Azeite de dendê (a very tasty, heavy, saffron-colored [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|palm oil]], which may not be omitted for moqueca under any circumstances)
* 200[[Cookbook:mL|mL]] [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
#Leave the fish in a [[Cookbook:Marinade|marinade]] made out of lemon juice and fine powdered pepper for at least one hour.
#Put the fish, onions, bell peppers, garlic, tomatoes and the cilantro in numerous layers into a pot.
#Pour the azeite de dendê and the coconut milk over all and let [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] everything for 20 minutes. From time to time ladle/scoop the liquid from the pot's bottom to its top. Be careful, in order not to break the fish! 
#Serve with white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

Note: To get the best taste you have to add more salt than you might think.

Also, is there interest in a WikiCommentary?


------

I believe it's imposible to include all of the different ways in which christians see things. 

Take just the nature of God, One God or a combination of three? Some christians (me included) don't believe that The Holy Spirit is a person, or they believe that Logos/Jezus/Michael was created by God. 

or take the first part of the lord's prayer: 

: ''Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.''
:: What name? Why should it be hallowed?
: ''Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on Earth, as it is in Heaven.''
:: What Kingdom? Why would He need a Kingdom? What is His Will for the Earth?

How would anyone be able to write about this without this turning into a editwar? Maybe it would be beter for every one to write their own book and leave it at that? -- Gmlk 21:31, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)

------

There are the various theologies at the theology page - Christian, Hindu, etc.

I think it is possible to include a discussion - if people add and not 'edit'?  if everyone added their own view it would be comprehensive if organized. most times there are not 12 different views on the personality of the holy spirit for example, there is two - yes or no, permitting it to be concise.

Do we split it into Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Methodist, Presbyterian, Liberal/Progressive, Traditional/Conservative, Fundamentalist, Evangelical, Ecumenical, Feminist, Liberation, etc?

------

I actually have started a wikicommentary page at wikicommentary.net . Its in a beta stage right now and I haven't completely settled in on a permanent data structure. Go ahead and check it out if you're interested in a wikicommentary. I think it can work. People can write their commentary directly on scripture, simply searching for a passage would retreive all relevant commentary in the database. It would be really cool if the order in which they appear could be randomized also. Anyway I'm just full of ideas right now and they need to be put in place before it will really work. --[[User:Stevecrozz|Stevecrozz]] 22:38, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Does God Exist?''' That is the principal question of theology.

There are several arguments attempted to prove the existence of God.
*Cosmological

&quot;The existence of God, as a First Cause, from the effects seen in the world&quot; (James Boyce). One may look around and observe reality, energy, matter, etc. and conclude that there must be a cause for the reality, energy, matter, etc. a Supreme Being.

*Ontological

The ontological argument was developed by Anselm: &quot;Something than which nothing greater can be thought so truly exists that it is not possible to think of it as not existing&quot;

*Teleological

Also known as Intelligent Design, the argument assumes that for there to be order, there must be a creator. The alternative is often referred to as the &quot;Tornado in the Junkyard&quot;

*Biblical
From a literal viewpoint, in [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Bible%2C_English%2C_King_James%2C_Genesis#Chapter_1 Genesis 1:1], the existence of God is assumed.

I apologize for inserting exercises in [[Programming:Perl simple examples|simple examples]] without checking for exercises [[Programming:Perl beginning exercises|elsewhere]]. I kind of feel like having the exercises inline is a good idea, since this is not a reference work. Still mulling this one over, advice welcome. --[[User:Yath|Yath]] 00:21, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Gui Programming ==

Does anyone know why the Gui programming bit is left out?

== Problem with navigation ==

I saw a problem with the prognav. The articles do not follow the order specified in the index. I tried to fix it. Since I'm not very experienced it would be best if someone can check-out the changes. --[[User:213.240.227.183|213.240.227.183]] 10:37, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

== Maybe rename to slash-split pages ==

Apparently, on MediaWiki, if the pages were named

* Programming:Perl / Getting started
* Programming:Perl / First program
* Programming:Perl / Strings
* Programming:Perl / Numbers
* Programming:Perl / Operators
* Programming:Perl / Data Types
* Programming:Perl / Data Types / Scalar Variables
* Programming:Perl / Data Types / Array Variables
* Programming:Perl / Data Types / Hash Variables
* Programming:Perl / User I/O
* Programming:Perl / Advanced Output
* Programming:Perl / Making choices: if and else
* Programming:Perl / Doing things over and over: while and for loops
* Programming:Perl / Filehandles

(and so on), then we'd get navigation and table-of-contents for free.  The [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas]] wikibook moved to this.  Why aren't the pages named like this?  If no-one objects, I'd be happy to start the renaming. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 19:39, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

Sounds perfect.   Is there any way to make the ''watching'' work the same way so we can watch the whole book, not just individual pages --[[User:155.91.19.73|155.91.19.73]] 00:02, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:You should not add spaces arround the '/' - only without spaces the page is considered a &quot;subpage.&quot; --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:29, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

You should remember, that [[WB:NP]] does not force renaming of old books - it's often too complicated.

: Having just renamed the largest of the programming books &lt;small&gt;(205 modules - the remaining of programming is now only 481 modules)&lt;/small&gt;, I can say: it's not to complicated to rename a book if you plan it propper &lt;small&gt;([[Talk:Ada_Programming/New_Name_needed]])&lt;/small&gt;. It's just a choice if you want to do it or not. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

I won't reccomend slash convention as navigation is already present in the book and automatic links would only mess up. IMO if you want to change naming convention, you should use flat semicolon convention:

* Programming:Perl:Operators
* Programming:Perl:Data Types
* Programming:Perl:Scalar Variables

It also has advantage of consistency with Programming: prefix - if we use both semicolon and slash in names, we would confuse reader. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 08:16, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

: Indeed. Books inside [[Programming]] are better off using &quot;:&quot; - only it's called a colon not semicolon - the later is the &quot;;&quot;. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is deprecated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:15, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:Alright I renamed a good portion of the pages.   I've been getting many server errors and am going to stop now.   To the next reader...keep the torch lit!   [[User:Justforasecond|Justforasecond]] 05:34, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== PerlScript ==

I am discussing the Windows Script Host in the [[Windows Programming]] book, and I have touched on the topic of &quot;PerlScript&quot;. I notice that this book currently doesn't have a section on PerlScript, but I think it is a usefull enough topic to have a place somewhere here in Wikibooks. My question is, should I discuss it in the [[Windows Programming]] book, or should we discuss it here at [[Perl]]? --[[User:129.32.61.130|129.32.61.130]] 00:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

:It could be mentioned in passing here maybe with some examples, but it probably doesn't make sense to have a ton of detail.  [[User:71.112.2.226|71.112.2.226]] 05:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

== Perl Wikibot ==

I am currently working on a perl framework for interfacing with mediawiki. The framework has a number of components, including components that actually interface with the wikibooks server (or any other mediawiki server, if specified), and components that manipulate and analyze wiki-formatted text. At the moment, I have about half a dozen individual modules, some of which are in very rough shape, and I would like to expand the framework to include more functionality:
#graphical interface using TK widgets
#scripting interface for batch jobs
#remote interface for receiving and executing remote commands (either from a dedicated wiki-page, an IRC chatroom, email, etc)
#tied filehandle class for reading and writing to wiki using '''open''', '''print''', '''read''', '''close''', etc. 
#RC monitoring (probably via irc://irc.wikimedia.org/en.wikibooks), to find obvious vandalism (&quot;On Wheels!&quot;) and revert it automatically
Now, I'm not a great perl programmer, but I could pick my way through all these tasks over time. I am thinking about creating a sourceforge project to work on this, if other people want to join the project. If nobody else wants to work on it, I'll keep it to myself. I don't necessarily want to create a replacement/competitor for the &quot;pywikibot&quot; that is a popular tool, especially on wikipedia. If anybody is interested in this project, drop me a line [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my talk page]], or send me an email at '''wknight8111 &lt;at&gt; hotmail &lt;dot&gt; com''', with a subject line containing &quot;'''wikibooks'''&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:59, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== New section about DBI ==

I added a new section about DBI programming. It is based on a tutorial i wrote once for colleagues. You are welcome to improve it, of course. Currecntly it has only one example for Oracle. An example for a free database, such as MySQL, would be most welcome. --[[User:Amire80|Amire80]] 10:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

== Merging Picking Up Perl into this book ==

I have a book that I started writing called ''[http://www.ebb.org/PickingUpPerl Picking Up Perl]'' that I have long since abandonded.  I'd like to simply bring it over to WikiBooks.  The question is whether to merge it into this book, or to put it up as its own thing.  The latter is much easier, so I'd prefer that as I don't have a lot of time, but if folks think that's a bad idea, I won't do it.  Thoughts? -- [[User:Bkuhn|bkuhn]] 16:57, 24 August 2007 (UTC)
:I decided to make the effort to merge the text of Picking Up Perl, which has already been under the FDL for years, long before Wikibooks existed, into this book.  I am doing it piece-meal when I get time, and I am keeping track of which sections have been merged here.  Please note here if you merge a section in so I know not to do it. -- [[User:Bkuhn|bkuhn]] 20:44, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

== Perl 6 Book ==

I think it would be far too much work to try and cram information about Perl 6 into this book as well, there is far too little overlap with existing Perl 5 materials, and I think it would be better off as it's own book. To that end, I've been working on an outline for a new Perl 6 book in my user space: [[User:Whiteknight/Perl 6 Programming]]. Anybody who is interested in this project, come take a look at what I have so far, and let me know what you think. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:57, 10 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">An Anticoagulant is a substance used to prevent blood clots. It is useful for patients who (i) are at an increased risk of large abnormal blood clots (ex. have high cholesterol, or high blood pressure) (ii) have had heart valve surgery, (iii) have a prosthetic valve made of synthetic material, and (iv) have atrial fibrillation. 

MORE INFO:
Clotting is an important property of blood. It is sometimes desirable that such clotting of blood be prevented. Anticoagulants are used both inside and outside the human body to prevent the clotting of blood.


USE OF ANTICOAGULANT IN HUMANS: 
Example 1: 

Thrombosis : The formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel is described as Thrombosis. Such blood clots obstruct the flow of blood through the circulatory system. For example, your blood clots when you cut yourself so that you will not bleed to death. In cases where thrombosis is causing disease, anticoagulants can be used (at carefully controlled dosages) to reduce the tendency to clotting. 

Common anticoagulants for this use are Warfarin, Heparin (various heparins exist), and nicoumalone.


USE OF ANTICOAGULANT OUTSIDE HUMAN BODY: 
Anticoagulants are also used to prevent the clotting of blood outside the body. 

Examples

1) Blood transfusion bags : Blood is collected from donors and stored into sterile plastic bags. To maintain the fluid state of blood, it is necessary to prevent the clotting of blood. Chemicals like  Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD) and Citrated Phosphate Dextrose (CPD) can be added to stop blood clotting

2) Medical and surgical equipments: If blood is allowed to clot, these equipments will get clogged up and thus will no longer work. 
To prevent this from happening suitable anticoagulants are used

      <text xml:space="preserve">Did the suffragists play a role in the prohibition law?

== Suffrage and the 1920s ==

I disagree with the placement of the Women's Suffrage movement in the chapter beginning in 1920 because the Nineteenth Amendment (which is all the section about women currently covers here) was officially ratified with Tennessee in June of 1920. I believe this section should be placed in the last chapter (which spans the primary period of the movement), or, at the very least, put the official ratification at the very beginning of the section on women in this chapter.

The big deal about many, though not most, women in the 1920s was the flapper. They began a revolution among women, and I believe that should be covered far more than the suffrage movement in this chapter.

-- [[User:Lord Mardicia|Lord Mardicia]]

== There's too much material about Germany ==

Why is there so much information about Germany here?  It's American history, not the &quot;History Channel&quot;.  Too many history  buffs are closet Nazis.  If there's any German content to add, it's about the German-American ethnic community, it's relation to the Midwest, and Americanization policies.  That relates to the rise of the KKK and African Americans.  The 1920s was the Great Migration, when African Americans migrated from the South to the North and West, to escape the poverty of sharecropping and oppression of Jim Crow.  There was also a tide of anti-Asian nativism that culminated in stopping of immigration from Asia.  There should also be a discussion of isolationism after WW1

Also, the Prohibition movement and the Suffrage movement were related - leading Suffragists were leaders in the Prohibition movement, and they allied with secular womens' groups.  There was a huge morality movement, and it was led by women.  How can one discuss prohibition without the WCTU?

The Henry Ford stuff should be expanded.  The development of the assembly line was a significant change.  Until Ford, cars were produced by groups of workers acting as craftsmen.  Ford reduced the skill required to assemble the car, and hired less skilled farm boys to work in the factories.

The Roaring 20s were not only a period of prosperity and technology -- it was also the formation of a bubble economy built on speculation and overvalued real estate and easy credit, and this led to the Great Depression.

== Re: Revivalism ==

This was actually a long-ranging topic. The Five Fundamentals (the basis for Fundamentalism) were formulated in the 1890s. Amee Semple MacPherson and Billy Sunday had begun their careers in the Teens. It's possible that tabloids and radio increased the visibility of the revival movement (and tent meetings gained electric lighting and amplification), but there was actually a decline in activity.

==What Is This Book About?==
This book is about programming competitions and what you need to know in order to be competitive....

==Where Can I Compete?==
* Annual ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC) and their associated regional contests
* Annual TopCoder Open (TCO)
* Annual TopCoder Collegiate Contest
* Annual Facebook Hacker Cup
* Annual Google Code Jam 
* Annual International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) Programming Contest
* Weekly TopCoder contests
* Annual Business Professionals of America Conferences (National High School vocational program)
* Various online judges ([http://uva.onlinejudge.org/], [http://www.spoj.pl/])

==Why Should I Compete?==
The primary reason why people compete in programming contests is that they enjoy it. For many, programming is actually fun, at least until they get a job doing it and their desire is burnt out of them. It is also a good way to meet people with similar interests to your own.  But for those of you who need additional incentive, it is also a good way to increase others awareness of you.  Major programming competitions are always monitored by people looking for new talent for their organizations, sometimes these are the people who actually fund the contest.  High school programming contests (such as the ones sponsored by the BPA) often are to help prepare students for college or careers in computer programming. These contests often attract scouts from colleges looking to award scholarships to these individuals. For example, IBM is currently funding the ICPC, a contest that costs them millions annually.  Why would they pay so much for a programming contest?  They view it as an investment. It lets them filter through the talent and get to those that could potentially make IBM much more money in the long run. Before IBM the contest was funded by Microsoft for the same reasons.  Organizations that feel like they can't quite afford the huge price tag associated with ICPC have begun to fund cheaper contests, such as TopCoder, and in the case of Google, running their own contest through TopCoder's technology.

==How Do I Get Started?==
The first thing needed to get started is proficiency in a programming language and familiarity with a text editor/development environment.  The two languages common to all of the above programming competitions are C++ and Java.  These languages will be used throughout this document.  There are many books and tutorials available to learn these languages, in addition to an unending amount of freely available code on the internet.

==Which Language Should I Use?==
In a competitive programming environment the value of a programming language differs from a software engineering environment.  While good software engineering practices will not hurt you in completing a task, they can often consume valuable time with little benefit.  Many software engineering techniques are designed for projects with many programmers and projects that take a large amount of time to complete.  In a programming competition these conditions no longer hold.  Most times it is a single programmer working on a task, with very little time in which to complete it. Also, some programming contests test a programmer's skills in a specific language.

==What Are The Contests Like?==
[[File: C++Stopwatch.png|100px|thumb| C++ can be used in certain timed competitions]]
The TopCoder Open is available to both college students and professionals who are registered members of the TopCoder website and who are at least 18 years of age at the time of registration.   The Tournament consists of three online rounds which lead up to the main onsite tournament and includes several competitions: Algorithm, Design, Development, Marathon, Mod Dash, and Studio Design.  Competitions such as the Coding Phase in the Algorithm round allow contestants to choose between four programming languages, Java, C#, C++, and VB.NET, so you can use the one you are best at.  There are also competitions where you get the chance to challenge the functionality of other competitors’ code.(“Welcome to the 2012 TopCoder Open” Copyright © 2001-2012, TopCoder, Inc. http://community.topcoder.com/tco12/)

[[Image:Olive oil.jpg|right|thumb|olive oil]]
'''Olive oil''' is an [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] derived from the fruit of the olive tree, which originated in the [[Cookbook:Mediterranean cuisines|Mediterranean]] area. It is produced by pressing [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]] and has a very high content of monounsaturated fats.

Olive oil was traditionally produced by beating the trees with sticks to knock the olives off and crushing them in stone or wooden mortars or beam presses. Nowadays, olives are ground to tiny bits, obtaining a paste that is mixed with water and processed by centrifugation, separating the oil from the pomace (the other remaining substances).

Edible commercial olive oil can be divided into several categories according to its chemical characteristics and the production method: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Virgin Olive Oil, and Olive Oil. The first two, virgin olive oils, are obtained only by physical extraction from the fruits. Non virgin olive oil is obtained by the chemical refining of a low-quality non-edible grade of virgin olive oil called &quot;lampante&quot; olive oil.

A second type of oil can be extracted from the remaining pomace. This is called Olive Pomace Oil and it is obtained, like all the other food oils, by treatment with a chemical solvent, generally hexane, and subsequent chemical refining.

Of all the categories, extra virgin olive oil presents the highest organoleptic, nutritional, and health qualities, as well as the most &quot;flowery&quot; taste.  
Today olive oil is mainly used in cooking and also in cosmetics and soaps, but it has been used for medicines and as a fuel for oil lamps.

&quot;Cold Pressed&quot; Extra Virgin Olive Oil is generally considered the best grade of olive oil.  As the name suggests, it is obtained without heating the pressed mass.  Heating frees more of the oil but lowers the quality of the resulting oil.  Cold Pressed Extra Virgin olive oil is best suited to specialist uses such as salad dressings.  Olive oil has a low [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] (200°F for fancy flavorful grades, and 400°F for the cheap refined grades) and so is not well suited for cooking at high temperatures.  Blended oils containing olive oil are available and combine to make a higher smoke point. 

Olive oil is produced in areas that have a Mediterranean climate.  Large producers of olive oil include [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greece]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]], and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]].

==Cooking with olive oil==
Olive oil can substitute [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] in a 3:4 ratio for most recipes. In other words, if your recipe calls for 1 cup of margarine or butter, you can substitute for 3/4 cup Olive oil. Do not make this substitution if you plan on cooking the recipe at 400°F (200°C) or higher. The olive oil will start to smoke at these high temperatures and will make your food have a metallic taste.

==Recipes featuring olive oil==
Many recipes in the cookbook use olive oil.  Those listed below feature olive oil as a primary ingredient.  For a full list, please use the &quot;What links here&quot; link.

The mail function is used to send E-mail Messages through the SMTP server specified in the php.ini Configuration file.
 bool '''mail''' ( string to, string subject, string message [, string additional_headers [, string additional_parameters]])
The returned boolean will show whether the E-mail has been sent successfully or not.

This example will send message &quot;message&quot; with the subject &quot;subject&quot; to email address &quot;example@domain.tld&quot;. Also, the receiver will see that the eMail was sent from &quot;Example2 &lt;example2@domain.tld&gt;&quot; and the receiver should reply to &quot;Example3 &lt;example3@domain.tld&gt;&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 mail(
  &quot;example@domain.tld&quot;, // E-Mail address
  &quot;subject&quot;, // Subject
  &quot;message&quot;, // Message
  &quot;From: Example2 &lt;example2@domain.tld&gt;\r\nReply-to: Example3 &lt;example3@domain.tld&gt;&quot;  // Additional Headers
 );
&lt;/source&gt;
There is no requirement to write E-mail addresses in format &quot;Name &lt;email&gt;&quot;, you can just write &quot;email&quot;.

This will send the same message as the first example but includes From: and Reply-To: headers in the message. This is required if you want the person you sent the E-mail to be able to reply to you. Also, some E-mail providers will assume mail is spam if certain headers are missing so unless you include the correct headers your mail will end up in the junk mail folder.

=='''Important notes'''==

* PHP by default does not have any mail sending ability itself. It needs to pass the mail to a local mail transfer agent, such as [[w:sendmail|sendmail]]. This means you cannot just run PHP by itself and expect it to send mail; you ''must'' have a mail transfer agent installed.
* Make sure you do not have any newline characters in the to or subject, or the mail may not be sent properly.
* However, the additional headers field -- which should always include the From: header -- may also include other headers. On PHP for Windows, each header should be followed by \r\n but on Unix versions, you should only include \n between header lines. Don't put \n or \r\n after the final additional header line.
* The to parameter should not be an address in the form of &quot;Name &lt;someone@example.com&gt;&quot;. The mail command may not parse this properly while talking with the MTA (Particularly under Windows).

==Error Detection==
Especially when sending multiple emails, such as for a newsletter script, error detection is important.

Use this script to send mail while warning for errors:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $result = @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);

 if ($result) {
     echo &quot;Email sent successfully.&quot;;
 } else {
     echo &quot;Email was not sent, as an error occurred.&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Sending To Multiple Addresses Using Arrays==
In the case below the script has already got a list of emails, we simply use the same procedure for using a loop in PHP with mysql results. The script below will attempt to send an email to every single email address in the array until it runs out.
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
       mail($row['email'], $subject, $message, null, &quot;-f$fromaddr&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Then if we integrate the error checking into the multiple email script we get the following

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $errors = 0
 $sent = 0
 
 while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
       $result = &quot;&quot;;
       $result = @mail($row['email'], $subject, $message, null, &quot;-f$fromaddr&quot;);
       if (!$result) {
           $errors = $errors + 1;
       }
       $sent = $sent + 1;
 }
 
 echo &quot;You have sent $sent messages&quot;;
 echo &quot;However there were $errors messages&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'd like to help out, especially in the &quot;applied math&quot; section, which I note is pretty sparse.

I'm familiar with lots of different topics (PhD 2006), and am particularly interested in broader organization of different classes in a logical order.  This was discussed farther down the page as well, I think, but for example &quot;general math&quot; and &quot;higher math&quot; don't seem like particularly informative categories when &quot;general math&quot; contains differential topology.

So, anyway, I want to contribute my class notes as I develop them in the coming years, but I'm particularly interested in thinking on a higher level.  Now, the main bookshelf pages are not editable, so what do I have to do to join in such discussions?  Are there Administrators of this bookshelf with whom I could talk?

What should I do if want to join this project and make my contributions?
Ahmad Abdullah


To what extent should these books be written in LaTeX? If people feel that they should in general be in LaTeX, then I will start working on doing that.
--[[User:ComplexZeta|ComplexZeta]] 02:26, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)
: They are written using the Wiki formatting system, which does incorporate use of TeX, so there is no need. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:08, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== General style guide? ==
Is there a general style guide for constructing math books? 
Of not, I believe there should be one! Not just general rules, but a collection of
templates, specific rules, (like new terms should be in ''italics'') and such. 
Colors, how to name things, and such. [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 20:10, 21 October 2007 (UTC)


Halmos wrote a wonderful essay on how to write mathematics.  I wish I could dig it up right now.  It could serve as an excellent basis for a style guide.

== We need a dependency tree! ==

Most math courses build on prerequisite knowledge.  Calculus requires algebra and trig.  Trig requires geometry.  We need a dependency tree so interested readers can find where to start.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 16:17, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: If one approaches things through Wikiversity, there should be one, it's in the works. See [[Wikiversity:School of Mathematics]]. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:33, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: If your going to write a math wiki-book, remember to keep copious amountws of backlinks to previous concepts that need to be known.

== math category tag &amp;ndash; [[:Category:Mathematics]] ==

So, should all these books be tagged with
  &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Mathematics]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 19:57, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

== RenderPNG ==

{{RenderPNG}}

I created a template that notifies the user that certain pages simply look better when the math formulas look better rendered as PNG. The template could probably use a little work, i am pretty bad with the html color codes after all. This template also links to a category [[:Category:RenderPNG]], so that we can keep track of pages that use alot of formulas (and look better in PNG). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:32, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

==Catalogue for High School==
Hi!  As a high school math teacher, it would be awesome if it were easy to reference which pages were high school appropriate...could i create a high school page?  That links to stuff i found at wikiversity, and here, etc....
[[User:JamieJones|JamieJones]] 15:59, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

:Pages of lists, in general, are not appropriate on wikibooks. However, it would be possible to create a template that lables certain pages as being &quot;Highschool Appropriate&quot;, and a category to lump all those pages together, under a single heading. If you would like to start setting that project up, leave me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my talk page]], and I will help you out with the details. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Digital Signal Processing|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:08, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

==Book of Theorems and Proof Sketches==

What would be the thought on compiling important pure mathematical results, and compiling them in a book organized by field? Proof sketches or complete proofs could be given for all. The book would assume knowledge of the particular fields, while the field would be largely independent. The fields could be done in a largely sequential manner, where beginning results are proved first, and other results are proven from things previously proven. [[User:Robert Carr|Robert Carr]] 00:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

: See [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs]]. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 06:56, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

==On 5/12/06==
I reorganized the bookshelf into mathamatical catagories for easier reference. [[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 02:02, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganizing/Refactoring &quot;Algebra&quot; ==

The &quot;algebra&quot; section contains a number of different books, many of which are currently sharing or duplicating material between themselves. Also, some of the booknames don't correspond to any specific body of information, such as [[Intermediate Algebra]], or [[Algebra I - A Verbose Approach]]. I would like to propose a merger and a reorganization of this section as follows:

The remaining books will be:

*[[Algebra I in Simple English]] (unchanged)
*[[Algebra]] (incorporating [[Algebra I - A Verbose Approach]] and [[Intermediate Algebra]])
*[[Linear Algebra]]
*[[Abstract algebra]] (Incorporating [[Discrete mathematics]], and possibly moved to [[Abstract Algebra]])

Also, I would like to separate out the material so that it goes more or less in a chronological order: Algebra &amp;rarr; Linear Algebra &amp;rarr; Abstract Algebra. This means that we will no longer be cross-linking chapters, and there will be no more redundant information in these books. Here is my proposed listing of topics for each book, (not in a particular order):

*[[Algebra]]
**Arithmetic review
**Polynomials, Quadratic Equation, etc
**Factoring Polynomials, Solving for X
**Functions, Equalities, Inequalities, Function combinations
**Conic Sections and Graphing
**Exponentials, Radicals, and Logarithms
*[[Linear Algebra]]
**Systems of Equations
**Matrices, Vectors
**Matrix Operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, determinant)
**Cramer's Rule
**Submatrices (minors, adjoint, etc)
**Matrix Inverses
**Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
**Linear Transformations
**Vector Spaces (lead in to [[Abstract Algebra]]...)
*[[Abstract Algebra]]
**Sets and Compositions
**Semigroups, Groups, Abelian Groups
**Rings, fields and modules 
**Isomorphisms, Homomorphisms
**Modules, Algebras

This layout will make things flow better, will make the organization nicer, will reduce duplicate material and cross-links, etc. If nobody objects to this change, I would like to get to work on it soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:52, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

:That is great! [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 19:59, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

== Standardized Problems and Solutions ==

Hey all. I just found a great template that I think we should standardize and use for all questions and solutions. The template looks like this:

  |{| class=&quot;navbox collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; border: 0px; margin-top: 0.2em;&quot;
  |-
  ! style=&quot;background-color: #B4CDCD;&quot; | 
  |-
  | style=&quot;border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;&quot; |
  |}

Just disregard the first |; I put that in so that I could put lines around the text. In any event, it looks like a great way to present problems. Here's one I made: 

{| class=&quot;navbox collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; border: 0px; margin-top: 0.2em;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background-color: #B4CDCD;&quot; | Question: Convert &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; into degree form.
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;&quot; | '''Solution:''' '''90&amp;deg;'''
|}

(NOTE: To see the way it actually looks on the page, follow this link to my talk page and look at &quot;Template Example&quot;: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Robinson0120)

http://www.december.com/html/spec/color.html has a number of hexadecimal colors to choose from for the question and answer background, too. 

So, what does everybody think? [[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] 03:14, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

:I think it is a great idea, how does it work when printing on paper? I like the last one the most, the rendered math have white background, and it looks bad on the coloured background. Nice idea anyway! [[User:Paxinum|Paxinum]] 19:59, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

== [[Algebra 2]] ==

This book needs help. I would delete it if I could, but it should at least be given a chance and besides, I have the [[Pilingual Primer]] deletion to put up with. Please, someone, help! [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 23:12, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

== Reorganize Bookshelf ==

I think instead of having general advanced and special as catagories there should be just Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, and Statistics, and any other type of math. Then inside each category make a book for each school year. For example grade 3 Geometry could include identifying polygons, and grade 10 Geometry could include Trigonometry. I think it would be easier to reference that way, and even if the curriculums are different they can go through in order and see where they're at. Also I think that there should be separate text books and work books. So there would be &quot;Geometry gr. 3 Textbook&quot;, and &quot;Geometry gr. 3 Workbook&quot;. The text book would just strictly explain concepts and maybe have some examples. I feel the way books are organized right now is confusing and inefficient and if anyone has any suggestions to modify my system they are welcome. [[User:Mason L.|Mason L.]] ([[User talk:Mason L.|talk]]) 04:15, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

== Priorities list ==

I think that it would be a good idea to have an ordered list of wikibooks, ordered according to which books are more or less important to improve first.--[[Special:Contributions/24.62.238.203|24.62.238.203]] ([[User talk:24.62.238.203|talk]]) 16:51, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

:I'll go out on a limb here and make a list of what books I think should be prioritized. The ones that I'll list as 'high' priority are books that will be useful to the most wide audience as well as having enough content already established as to make contributing a Herculean task. The 'medium' priority books are books that I feel will be used by a narrower population or need enough work done that it might be intimidating to try and take one of them on. All of the other books I would personally mark as 'low priority' as I feel the core books for a typical math education should be established first. So, here's my list (feel free to provide input/criticism!):
:'''High priority'''
:*Linear Algebra
:*Trigonometry
:*Calculus
:*Statistics
:'''Medium priority'''
:*Arithmetic
:*Geometry
:*Number Theory
:*Set Theory
:*Mathematical Proof
:*Abstract Algebra

== Geometry Shelf ==

I feel that some books ([[Algebraic Geometry]],[[Crystallography]],[[Topology]],[[Combinatorial Topology]] and [[Differential Geometry]]) that are currently in the geometry shelf under 'basic math' definitely belong to higher mathematics. Should I move them?

[[User:SPat|SPat]] ([[User talk:SPat|talk]]) 03:58, 4 April 2008 (UTC)

:Also, the first half of the book [[Topology]], titled '''Point-Set Topology''' is quite developed whereas the second half titled '''Algebraic Topology''' is sparse. Does it make sense to split the book?&lt;br /&gt;[[User:SPat|SPat]] ([[User talk:SPat|talk]]) 01:41, 5 April 2008 (UTC)
::They are quite developed because I developed them - well, most of the basic stuff. I just didn't bother to develop the second half yet. I do not think this is best because, well, they can be developed later.--[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 08:23, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

== Re: ==

I have made some changes to the arrangement of the shelf, the biggest being shifting certain books from the &quot;basic&quot; [[Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf#Geometry|geometry]] section to a new one titled &quot;[[Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf#Geometry and Topology|Geometry and Topology]]&quot;. Also, I've moved the section &quot;[[Wikibooks:Mathematics bookshelf#Differential Equations|differential equations]]&quot; to higher math.

'''Grape seed oil''' is a [[Cookbook:Oil|vegetable oil]] pressed from the seeds of Vitis vinifera [[Cookbook:Grape|grapes]], an abundant byproduct of wine making.  Grape seed oil is used for: [[Cookbook:Salad|salad dressings]], [[Cookbook:Marinade|marinades]], [[Cookbook:Deep fry|deep frying]], flavored oils, [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], massage oil, sunburn repair lotion, hair products, body hygiene creams, lip balm and hand creams.

== Cooking ==

Grape seed oil is extracted from grape seeds and has a relatively high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]], approximately 320 °F (160 °C), so it can be safely used to cook at high temperatures. Grape seed oil is commonly used for [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fries]], [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéing]] and [[Cookbook:Fondue|fondue]]. In addition to its high smoking point, grape seed oil has other positive attributes in relation to cooking. It has a clean, light taste that has been described as 'nutty'. Because of its 'neutral' taste, grape seed oil is often used as a base for infusing or flavoring with [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], or other [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herbs or spices]].

The metabolic energy density of grape seed oil is comparable to that of other oils, about 120 [[Cookbook:kCal|kCal]] per tablespoon (34 [[Cookbook:kJ|kJ]]/[[Cookbook:mL|mL]]). However, the fact that less oil is needed for cooking may be useful when observing a low-fat diet.

== Vitamins in grape seed oil ==

Vitamin E (0.8 to 1.2 g/kg), [[Metabolomics/Nutrition/Vitamin C|Vitamin C]] and Beta-Carotene.

'''Cottonseed oil''' is a [[Cookbook:Oil|vegetable oil]] extracted from the seeds of the cotton plant after the cotton lint has been removed. It must be refined to remove gossypol, a naturally occurring toxin that protects the cotton plant from insect damage. Cottonseed oil has no cholesterol and is very low in trans fatty acids. It is commonly used in manufacturing [[Cookbook:Potato Chip|potato chips]] and other snack foods.

Along with [[Cookbook:Soy|soybean oil]], cottonseed oil is very often partially or fully hydrogenated. The growing consensus is that in hydrogenated (trans fat) form these oils are very unhealthy. Cottonseed oil was the first oil to be hydrogenated, originally intended for candle production, not food. Proctor &amp; Gamble created and patented this technique, and the marketed name of the product was Crisco.

Since cotton crops are under far less chemical regulation that other other crops used specifically for food, many pesticides or chemicals can be used on cotton crops that are illegal for use on food crops, yet the cottonseed can find it's way into the food chain because of this major legal loophole in the regulation of food and chemicals by the FDA. Some serious pesticides or chemicals could resist processing and find their way into the food chain because of this.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Msex. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Msex~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a basic program that does absolutely nothing:
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program first;
begin
   (*comment*)
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is a line by line description of what the different lines do.  
#&lt;code&gt;program first;&lt;/code&gt; - is the &quot;program header&quot;. Program headers are for dealing with multiple programs and &quot;units&quot;. For most dialects this is optional.
#&lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; - tells the compiler where the program begins. In more complex programs this statement might be preceded by statements that declare variables, set up functions and handle other preparation before the main program begins.
#&lt;code&gt;(*comment*)&lt;code&gt; - is a comment that is ignored by the compiler.  The &lt;code&gt;(*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*)&lt;/code&gt; tell the compiler to ignore what's in between them, almost all dialects of pascal also use braces ( &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) for the same purpose. In the original Pascal, these can't be embedded like this: &lt;code&gt;(*(*example*)*)&lt;/code&gt;.  However, in almost all dialects that use braces also use precedence, so this works: &lt;code&gt;{(*example*)}&lt;/code&gt;. In some dialects  such as Free Pascal's default mode comments can be embedded.
#&lt;code&gt;end.&lt;/code&gt; - (notice the period) tells the compiler to stop compiling. In fact, anything after that is completely ignored.  As we shall see, there may be many &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; statements in a program, but the &lt;code&gt;end&lt;code&gt; statement that terminates the program is the only statement that ends in a period.  

While programs that do absolutely nothing may compile, they aren't generally that exciting.  It would be much better to have a program that introduced itself to the world.  These programs are very popular, especially when introducing a new language, and if you've ever learned another programming language you may be familiar with such &quot;Hello World&quot; examples.  

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program HelloWorld;
begin (*This is where the program begins*)
   writeln('Hello world!');
end. {This is where the program ends.}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now instead of doing nothing our program contains one line, namely &quot;writeln('Hello World!');&quot;.  The command writeln prints its argument to the terminal.  In the current case its argument, 'Hello World!' is a string.  If you are familiar with other programming languages it would be useful to note that in Pascal strings and characters are contained between single quotes and not double quotes.  The last but important thing to notice is the &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the writeln statement.  Almost all statements in Pascal should end with a semicolon.  This is because the compiler doesn't care about the white space you put, including line breaks.  So our program would have been just as functional as

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program HelloWorld;
begin (*This is where the program begins*)
                                  writeln('Hello world!');



end. {This is where the program ends.}
&lt;/source&gt;

or 
&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program HelloWorld;begin (*This is where the program begins*)writeln('Hello world!');end.{This is where the program ends.}
&lt;/source&gt;

To the compiler they are exactly the same.  But the compiler still needs to know where one statement ends and the next begins.  For this reason Pascal uses the semicolon to mark where lines end.  The observant reader will notice that we only said that &quot;almost all&quot; lines need to end in a semi-colon.  We shall point out the exceptions as they arise, there are three Exceptions in this program. The first exceptions is the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;begin&lt;code&gt;&quot;, and the second is the line &lt;code&gt;end.&lt;/code&gt; (since this terminates the program it ends in a  period instead of a semicolon.).  The last exception is that the line that comes before an &quot;&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&quot; doesn't need to end in a semicolon. So really in this program the line &quot;writeln('Hello World!');&quot; didn't actually need a semicolon despite all the discussion about it.  On the other hand, there is no harm in including the semicolon.  It also makes the life easier later if you decide to add a line after the &quot;writeln&quot; command, because then you no don't need to remember to add it later. 

Unlike many programming languages the Pascal language is &lt;u&gt;not case sensitive&lt;/u&gt;!  For example consider the following program:

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program HelloWorld;
begin (*This is where the program begins*)
   writeln('Hello world!');
   WriteLn('It is nice to meet you.')
end. {This is where the program ends.}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here both &quot;&lt;code&gt;writeln&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;WriteLn&lt;code&gt;&quot; refer to the same function.  We could have also changed any of the other keywords in the program to as we liked.  One of the benefits of ignoring white space and case is that it allows us to structure the program in which ever way is most readable to us.

As a final comment, depending on your operating system and how you start any of these programs you have compiled, you may find that the window closes the instant the program is finished, which for these programs is almost instantly.  One useful trick to avoid this is to ask the program to wait for input from the user.  This can be done with the &quot;&lt;code&gt;readln&lt;code&gt;&quot; command.  So our simple HelloWorld program becomes: 

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program HelloWorld;
begin (*This is where the program begins*)
   writeln('Hello world!');
   readln;                     {This reads a line of input from the keyboard}
                               {So now the program waits for us to press enter :)}
end. {This is where the program ends.}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Bloom's Taxonomy *'''
[[File:BloomsCognitiveDomain.PNG|right|400 px]]

Benjamin Bloom created this taxonomy for categorizing levels of abstraction - thus providing a useful structure in which to describe Lesson Plan Components: Interest Approach, Discussion, Presentation, Demonstration, and Test Items. Content Goals start with an active verb.  Note the 'Cues' below, which suggest active verbs that may be used when creating Lesson Plan Components.  '''See the Example Lesson Plan'''.

'''Knowledge'''
:observation and recall of information 
:knowledge of dates, events, places 
:knowledge of major ideas 
:mastery of subject matter 
: Cues: list, define, tell, describe, identify, show, label, collect, examine, tabulate, quote, name, who, when, where, etc. 
'''Comprehension'''	
:understanding information 
:grasp meaning 
:translate knowledge into new context 
:interpret facts, compare, contrast 
:order, group, infer causes 
:predict consequences 
:Question Cues: summarize, describe, interpret, contrast, predict, associate, distinguish, estimate, differentiate, discuss, extend 
'''Application'''	
:use information 
:use methods, concepts, theories in new situations 
:solve problems using required skills or knowledge 
:Cues: apply, demonstrate, calculate, complete, illustrate, show, solve, examine, modify, relate, change, classify, experiment, discover 
'''Analysis'''
:seeing patterns 
:organization of parts 
:recognition of hidden meanings 
:identification of components 
:Cues: analyze, separate, order, explain, connect, classify, arrange, divide, compare, select, explain, infer 
'''Synthesis'''
:use old ideas to create new ones 
:generalize from given facts 
:relate knowledge from several areas 
:predict, draw conclusions 
:Cues: combine, integrate, modify, rearrange, substitute, plan, create, design, invent, what if?, compose, formulate, prepare, generalize, rewrite 
'''Evaluation'''
:compare and discriminate between ideas 
:assess value of theories, presentations 
:make choices based on reasoned argument 
:verify value of evidence 
:recognize subjectivity 
:Cues:  assess, decide, rank, grade, test, measure, recommend, convince, select, judge, explain, discriminate, support, conclude, compare, summarize 

'''*Adapted from:''' Bloom, B.S. (Ed.) (1956) Taxonomy of educational objectives: The classification of educational goals: Handbook I, cognitive domain. New York ; Toronto: Longmans, Green.

Note:  IPSI uses Bloom's work as modified by Simpson and Kratwold to create three domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and afective.  The first, second and fourth levels of Bloom form the cognitive domeain.  The third level of Bloom forms the psychomotor domain and the fifth and sixth levels of Bloom form the affective domain.  Accordingly, content will be parsed into one of nine categories --- three levels of cognitive, three of psychomotor and three of affective.  These nine categories are sufficiently precise so that prescriptions regarding instruction and testing can be aligned with the intent expressed in content goals.

I started expanding something about irregular verbs.  Wrote about anomalous verbs so far, still left to do are the garden-variety irregular (dar, estar, caber, etc.) which have future subjunctive different from personal infinitive and the simpler sound-shift classes.

Anyway, in a real textbook, irregulars shouldn't be presented all together -- they'll just cause a meltdown in the student's brain.  Since this book isn't organized in lesson format, though, we have no choice but to stick it all together. Maybe we ought to break it up into sections later on to help students wrap their heads around it better.

Removed ''preferir'' from the list of regular verbs.  It's derived from ''ferir'' and, like it, is irregular.  Eu pref'''i'''ro, que eu pref'''i'''ra, que tu pref'''i'''ras, etc.

Language is all around us. Language allows us to share complicated thoughts, negotiate agreements, and make communal plans. Our learning, our courting, our fighting &amp;mdash; all are mediated by language.

You can think of language as a ''technology'' &amp;mdash; humans manipulate their bodies to produce sounds, gestures, and appearances that encode messages using a shared system.

How then does the technology of language work? Answering this question is surprisingly hard; our language skills are automatic and therefore hard to reflect upon. Nevertheless, throughout the centuries, scholars have devised ways to study human language, although there is still much more research to be done and many mysteries to explore. The field of scholarship that tries to answer the question &quot;How does language work?&quot; is called ''linguistics'', and the scholars who study it are called ''linguists''.&lt;ref&gt;In common parlance, a ''linguist'' can simply be someone who speaks many languages. This is not the sense we mean, and whenever we say ''linguist'', we are referring to a scholar of linguistics. We will call someone who speaks many languages a ''polyglot''. Some linguists are also polyglots, but it is perfectly possible to be either one without being the other.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How do linguists learn about language? ==

Linguistics is a ''science''.&lt;ref&gt;Some debate this statement, contending that modern linguistic theory lacks predictive power. We will, however, let this assumption stand for now.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that linguists answer questions about language by observing the behavior of language users.

Astronomy has its enormous telescopes, particle physics has its supercolliders, biology and chemistry have intricate and expensive apparatus, all for learning about their particular facets of the world. Modern linguists go straight to the source by observing language users in action. One of the charms of linguistics is that the data is all around you; you need nothing more than a patient ear and an inquiring mind to do original linguistic research of your own. But you need not start from scratch &amp;mdash; generations of linguists before you have laid a fairly stable groundwork for you to build on. Throughout the history of linguistics, the primary source of data for linguists have been the ''speech, writing, and intuitions'' of language users around them.

This is not the only way one could imagine learning about language. For example, one could study respected authorities. But this approach raises an obvious question: how did the respected authorities learn what they knew? If each language were invented by an ancient sage, who determined once and for all how that language worked, the authoritative approach would have great appeal. We would go to the writings of the Founding Sage of Danish, for example, and to the writings of the sage's immediate disciples, to find out the Original Intent, much as American judges refer to the Constitution. But, as far as we can tell, this is ''not'' how most languages come to be. We have ancient authorities in plenty, but in most cases these authorities were merely trying to codify the practices of the people who seemed to them most skillful in the use of language. In other words, these authorities were themselves scientific linguists of a sort: they observed language users and tried to describe their behavior.

== Describing and prescribing ==

In literate cultures, it is common to have a tradition of '''language instruction'''. In formal classes, students are taught how to read and write. Furthermore, the teacher tells the students rules of proper usage. This is what is referred to as a '''prescriptive''' tradition, in which students are told what to do.  It is similar to being taught the proper way to do arithmetic or knit a sweater. Formal language instruction is usually ''normative'', which means that it involves a sense of &quot;should and shouldn't&quot;, a notion of right and wrong behavior.

By contrast, linguists follow a '''descriptive''' tradition, in which the object is to observe what people really do, and form theories to explain observed behavior. Any specific use of language is only considered ''right'' or ''wrong'' on the basis of whether it appears in ordinary, natural speech.

As a member of a literate culture, you have probably been exposed to a certain amount of your culture's traditional language instruction. When you first take up the study of linguistics, you will probably experience some discomfort as you observe language behaviors that you have been taught are wrong. It will be hard to suppress an almost instinctive reaction: &quot;This behavior is ''incorrect''. My observation is no good; the person I am observing is an unreliable source of information.&quot;

It is important to remember that traditional language instruction and scientific linguistics have completely different goals and methods. Traditional language instruction is intended to train students to use a '''standard language'''. Language standards exist largely to make sure formal communication is possible between distant regions, between generations, between centuries, between social classes. Modern civilization arguably depends on such formal communication. Its rules must be constant over wide areas, over long spans of time, across different social and economic groups. This leads to an interesting contradiction:

* The formal rules of a standard language are almost arbitrary. It doesn't matter in detail what they are, so long as everyone agrees to them and more or less follows them when formal communication is needed.
* Traditional language teachers need to imbue these mostly-arbitrary rules with a sense of ''rightness'', in order to enlist the students' moral sense in the cause of preserving the stability of the standard language.

The natural result is that students emerge from traditional language instruction with a strong sense that certain language behaviors are ''simply wrong''. Most members of a literate culture have this moral sense about language, and find it hard to suppress. Yet to do objective science, to find out how language really works, it is necessary to adopt a detached viewpoint and to treat all language users as valid. The first principle of linguistics is: ''Respect people's language behavior, and describe it objectively.''

In this book we will adopt this objective stance: language behaviors are not intrinsically right or wrong, and we seek to ''describe'' what they are, not to ''prescribe'' what they should be.

== Hidden knowledge: how linguistic inquiry works ==

Linguists often say that they study the knowledge that a native speaker must have in order to use their language &amp;mdash; not formal, school-learned knowledge, but a more subtle kind of knowledge, a knowledge so deeply-ingrained that language users often do not know they know it.

We will illustrate the type of knowledge we mean with a &quot;consciousness-raising&quot; exercise. We will show you some things about English that you must already know, but almost certainly don't 'know you know'.

=== Case study 1: English plurals ===
[[Image:Gabel.png|right|thumb|A fork]]
# Suppose you have one ''fork'', and I hand you another one. Now you have two ''forks''.
# If you have a ''spoon'' and find another, you have two ''spoons''.
# If your garden has a ''rosebush'', you might plant a second to have two ''rosebushes''.

(We will use boldface for language examples, that is, things that people might actually say.)

In order to speak English, you have to know how to make the ''plural'', or multiple form, of most nouns you hear. You probably do this effortlessly. If you ask most people how to do it, they will say &quot;Oh, you just add ''s''.&quot;

But listen carefully.

# To form the plural of ''fork'', you add a hissing sound, the first sound in the word ''sap''.
# To pluralize ''spoon'', you add a buzzing sound, the first sound in the word ''zap''.
# To pluralize ''rosebush'', you add an entire extra syllable, sounding similar to the word ''is''.

You use these three different plural endings every day, effortlessly, without conscious reflection. You always use the right one. It is even amusing to ''try'' to use the wrong plural ending. You ''can'' say ''*forkiz'', or ''*spoonce'', but you never do. (We use an asterisk to draw your attention to the fact that few people would ever say these things.) You must know the rules governing the use of these different plural endings somewhere inside you, but in all likelihood you never knew you knew until this moment. You must have some way to select the correct ending to use with each word, otherwise you would occasionally say things like ''*rosebushss''. But unless you have thought about this before, it is almost certain that even now that you have been exposed to the concept, you still have no idea how you manage to select the appropriate plural suffix every time. Here is something that you definitely know, but you cannot state it out loud. It is ''unconscious knowledge''.

Can you analyze your own behavior and figure out how you decide whether to use ''-s'', ''-z'', or ''-iz''? Take a few minutes and try. Write out a dozen or so common English nouns and classify them according to what plural ending you would use. Do you see any patterns? (Watch out for completely irregular nouns like ''foot''/''feet''; for now we are only concerned with &quot;S-plurals&quot;.)

One theory you might come up with is that the correct plural suffix must simply be memorized for each noun. This is a perfectly reasonable theory. Perhaps ''forks'' sounds better to us than ''*forkiz'' simply because the former is the only plural we have ever heard. However, this is not the case, because for new words we have never encountered we can still pick out a plural ending that sounds right. For example:

# If you have a zug, and you find another, you now have two ...
# Mike just finished making his third bidge, so he has made three ...
# I inherited a blick from each of my grandparents, which is why I have four ...
(Jean Berko-Gleason first studied examples similar to these as set in her [[w:wug test|wug test]]).

Complete these sentences with the appropriate plurals. Then have five English-speaking friends do it, but don't let them collude: force them to form their own plurals. You and your five friends will all agree: the first example gets a buzzing plural ''-z'', the second gets a whole syllable ''-iz'', and the third gets a hiss ''-s''. And none of you have ever heard those words before, nor do you have any clue what they mean. If plural endings were simply memorized, you and your friends would have had to guess the endings, and you would likely have made different guesses.

The second principle of linguistics is, ''Language knowledge is often unconscious, but careful inquiry can reveal it.''

== The idea of deep structure and the general outline of linguistic theory ==

What have linguists learned about how language works? What is the overall shape of modern linguistic theory?

Linguists espouse a variety of theories about language; differences between these theories are sometimes quite striking even to laypeople and sometimes so subtle that only well-read linguists can understand the distinctions being made. Arguments between linguists who support different theories can be quite heated. But underneath the noisy debate about details there is widespread consensus, which has been coalescing since the 1950s. This consensus sees, in every corner of human linguistic ability, at least two layers: a ''surface structure'' consisting of the sounds we actually speak and hear, and the marks we write and read, and a ''deep structure'' which exists in the minds of speakers. The deep and surface structures are often strikingly different, and are connected by ''rules'' which tell how to move between the two kinds of structure during language use. These rules are part of every language-users' unconscious knowledge.

The idea of deep structure is an unintuitive one. It is natural to be skeptical about it. Why do linguists believe that language structures inside the mind are so different from what we speak and hear? We will use another case study to give an example of the evidence.

=== Case Study 2: The English auxiliary ''wanna'' ===

(1a) ''Rachel doesn't want to do her linguistics homework.''

(1b) ''Rachel doesn't wanna do her linguistics homework.''

In many varieties of English, the two words ''want to'' can often be contracted into ''wanna''. English users are more likely to do this in speech than in writing, and are more likely to do it in relaxed, informal contexts. (Linguists use the word ''registers'' to describe the different behaviors language-users adopt depending on context.) The pronunciation of ''wanna'' lacks the clear ''t'' sound of ''want to''. English users evidently must know both variants.

Can ''want to'' ''always'' be contracted? Consider the following examples.

(2a) ''Who do you want to look over the application?''

(2b) ''*Who do you wanna look over the application?''

Again, we are using an asterisk to call your attention to the fact that the second example is not natural English to most native users. It is, in fact, traditional in linguistics to use an asterisk to mark an example that is somehow unacceptable or unnatural for native users.

As in our first case study, we seem to have found a mysterious piece of unconscious knowledge that English users all share. We do not resist changing (1a) into (1b), but something makes the change from (2a) to (2b) much less comfortable. What could it be? How do English speakers decide when ''want to'' may be contracted?

Perhaps the contraction is inhibited by the fact that (2a) is a question. We can test this theory with a similar example.

(3a) ''Who do you want to invite to the party?''

(3b) ''Who do you wanna invite to the party?''

Here, the contraction works fine. So the question-theory cannot be correct. In fact, the similarity between (2a) and (3a) makes (2a)'s resistance to contraction quite puzzling.

What follows is not ''the answer'' to the puzzle. Rather, it is a sketch of part of a theory that some linguists use to explain the observed behavior of ''wanna''. This theory was arrived at by considering many, many examples, and consulting many, many native English speakers. It is not in any way authoritative, but it illustrates the point we are trying to make. Consider some possible ''answers'' to questions (2a) and (3a), which we repeat for ease of reference:

(2a) ''Who do you want to look over the application?''

(2c) ''I want Yuri to look over the application.''

(3a) ''Who do you want to invite to the party?''

(3c) ''I want to invite Yuri to the party.''

Notice that in sentence (2c), the name ''Yuri'' comes between ''want'' and ''to'', separating these two words, while in (3c), the words ''want to'' are still next to each other. Let us hypothesize that in our minds, questions like (2a) and (3a) have some kind of mark that shows where we expect the answer to be inserted. Linguists sometimes call such a mark a ''trace'', and symbolize it with ''t''. So we might show this &quot;mental form&quot; of our two questions as follows:

(2d) ''Who do you want ''t'' to look over the application?''

(3d) ''Who do you want to invite ''t'' to the party?''

If such traces really exist in our minds, they would provide a very elegant explanation of when ''want to'' can be contracted. The proposed explanation is that we can contract ''want to'' only when there is nothing between the two words in the mental form of the sentence. We already knew this to be true when the interrupting material is audible. Of course ''want to'' cannot be contracted in (2c), because ''Yuri'' is in the way. Our proposal is to extend this explanation to inaudible material, and to say that ''want to'' cannot be contracted in (2a) because a trace is in the way.

You might object that we have invented traces precisely to explain when ''want to'' cannot contract; that we will simply hypothesize that every uncontractable example has a trace in the middle. This is a fair objection, but remember that we are not putting traces wherever we want, but only where we expect the answer to the question to fit. You are encouraged to try more examples on yourself and your friends.

This step of introducing traces to explain when ''want to'' may be contracted is a serious and profound piece of theory-building. We are saying that sentences in the mind are not exactly like their counterparts spoken aloud. They are not mere mental tape-recordings &amp;mdash; they can possess aspects, like traces, that cannot be heard. As soon as we take this theoretical step, we open up a new question: 'How is language represented in the mind?'. Linguists use the term '''deep structure''' to discuss the way sentences are represented in the mind. In contrast, '''surface structure''' means sentences as we hear or read them.

This leads to the third principle of linguistics: ''Sentences have deep structure in the mind, that is not directly observable, but may be inferred indirectly from patterns of language behavior''. It is this third principle that separates recent linguistic scholarship (since about 1950) from the centuries of work that went before.

== Using linguistic evidence cautiously ==

Before we proceed, we must say a few words about the mode of inquiry we are using. As we throw various examples at you, we are either marking them with asterisks &amp;mdash; ''starring'' them, as linguists say &amp;mdash; or we are not. In essence, we are asking you to go along with ''our'' judgment about whether or not the examples are natural, native English. We would prefer to be scientific about it; one way of doing this would be to perform a study in which we present our examples to a few hundred native English users, and have our subjects tell us whether they thought the examples were good English or not.

But such studies take a lot of time and effort, and it's easy to make mistakes in experimental technique that would weaken our confidence in the results. It is extremely tempting to use oneself as an experimental subject, and use one's own judgment about whether an example is natural English or not. There are obvious pitfalls to this approach. One may not be as typical a speaker as one believes. Or one's judgment may be unreliable in the highly artificial situation of asking oneself questions about one's own language.

But nevertheless, in some cases, the situation seems clear-cut enough that we can give examples, as we have been, in the reasonable confidence that the reader will agree with our judgments. This is a shortcut, and is not a good substitute for real data. But in reality, a lot of linguistics gets done this way, with scholars using themselves as informal experimental subjects. Doing research in this way incurs a debt, the debt of eventually backing up our claims with real experimental studies. It's fine to get preliminary insights by probing our own intuitions about language. Eventually, though, we must do real science, and we must remember that in any conflict between experimental data and our own intuitions, real data always wins.

== Structure of this Book &amp;mdash; Layers of Linguistics ==

As you may already have noticed, language is a hugely multifaceted entity. When we learn how to write in school, we are taught that individual letters combine to create words which are ordered into sentences that make up a composition. Spoken language is similar, but the reality of language is much more subtle.

The structure of language may be separated into many different layers. On the surface utterances are constructed out of sequences of sounds. The study of the production and perception of these sounds is known as '''phonetics'''. These sounds pattern differently in different languages. The study of how they group and pattern is known as '''phonology'''. These groups of sounds then combine to create words, which is '''morphology'''. Words must be ordered in specific ways depending on a language's '''syntax'''. The literal meaning assigned to words and sentences is the '''semantic''' layer, and the meaning of sentences in context is known as '''pragmatics'''. Each of these may be considered a branch of '''theoretical linguistics''', which studies the structure of models of language.

Don't worry if it's not yet clear to you what each of these subfields of linguistics deals with. The first chapters of this book go through these fields layer by layer, building up a clear picture of what linguistics is. We will then explore various topics of inquiry which apply our linguistic knowledge of these layers to solve real-life problems, a pursuit known as '''applied linguistics'''.  Branches of applied linguistics include: '''computational linguistics''', '''anthropological linguistics''', '''neurolinguistics''', '''sociolinguistics''', '''psycholinguistics''', '''discourse analysis''' and '''language acquisition'''.

== Workbook section ==

=== Exercise 1: Me and John ===

If you took English classes at school, you may have been warned against using the following sentence:

(4a) '''Me and John are friends.'''

You probably were instructed to replace it with the following:

(4b) '''John and I are friends.'''

Pronouns such as ''me, him, her, ...'' are termed 'objective pronouns' because traditionally they are considered to never appear as the subject&lt;ref&gt;Generally (though not always) whatever is performing the action. Don't worry about the definition of ''subject'' for now &amp;mdash; it will be defined in a later chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; of a verb, and prescriptivists rule that as such usage of them in this position is &quot;incorrect&quot;. However (4a) is not marked with an asterisk because it is still largely acceptable to native English speakers, and as descriptive linguists we are interested in both forms.

Now note that certain arrangements of pronouns (''I'', ''me'', ''John'', etc.) in the sentence make it ungrammatical to all English speakers:

(4c) '''*I and John are friends.'''

(4d) '''*Her and John are friends.'''

(4d) '''*I and him are friends.'''

List all possible combinations of two pronouns in the sentence &quot;___ and ___ are friends.&quot; that you can think of, and label each sentence which would not be said by native speakers with an asterisk. Then create a theory as to what makes any sentence of this form unacceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Bible claims that God made mankind in His own image in Genesis 1:26.  This does not equate that men are in the image of God and not women, as can be seen in Genesis 1:27, but rather that all of humanity possesses the Imago Dei. 

Christian theology strictly anthropomorphizes God as having a personality. Sometimes God is extremely angry and must kill whole towns; at other times, God appears infinitely compassionate. His human son, Jesus, is more renowned for compassion. The Bible does not record Jesus as having issued capital justice while on Earth. 

*Love for humankind
*Incapable of evil, being bound by His character which itself gives definition to goodness
*Perfectly just
*Shows emotion 
**Sorrow for mankind's folly and sinfulness
**Happiness when people repent
**Anger for mankind's rebellion against his commandments
*Has mercy on those who repent and believe in Him
*Does not lie

&lt;big&gt;Learning the High Norwegian Language&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Høgnorsk''' (en: High Norwegian) is the usual term for an unofficial, and today little used, form of one of the two written languages in Norway, [Nynorsk (en: New Norwegian) (the other one being Bokmål. The basis for the High Norwegian language direction, is a wish to preserve the New Norwegian written language as an independent language, free of the strong influence from Bokmål that today's New Norwegian has.

The written High Norwegian language is a tradition originating from the first version of the New Norwegian written language (then called (Landsmål), as it was built by [[w:Ivar Aasen|Ivar Aasen]] and later used by classical New Norwegian authors as [[w:Aasmund Olavsson Vinje|Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]], [[w:Arne Garborg|Arne Garborg]], [[w:Olav Nygard|Olav Nygard]] and [[w:Olav H. Hauge|Olav H. Hauge]].

==Systems of Simultaneous Equations==

In a previous chapter, solving for a single unknown in one equation was already covered.  However, there are situations when more than one unknown variable is present in more than one equation.  When in a given problem, more than one algebraic equation is true at a time, it is said there is a '''system of simultaneous equations''' which are all true together at once.  Such sets of multiple equations may help solve for more than one unknown variable in a problem, since having more than one unknown in one equation is typically not enough information to &quot;solve&quot; any of the unknowns.

An unknown quantity is something that needs algebraic information in order to solve it.  An equation involving the unknown is typically a piece of information which may provide the information to &quot;solve&quot; the unknown, i. e. to determine a specific number value (or limited number of discrete values) that the unknown is (or can be) equal to. Some equations provide little or no information and so do little or nothing to narrow down the possibilities for solutions of the unknowns.  Other equations make it impossible to satisfy an unknown with any real number, so the solution set for the unknown is an empty set.  Many other useful equations make it possible to solve an unknown with one or just a few discrete solutions.  Similar statements can be made for systems of simultaneous equations, especially regarding the relationships between them.

==Linear Simultaneous Equations with Two Variables==

In the previous module, linear equations with two variables were discussed.  A single linear equation having two unknown variables is practically insufficient to solve or even narrow down the solutions for the two variables, although it does establish a relationship between them.  The relationship is shown graphically as a line.  Another linear equation with the same two variables may be enough to narrow down the solution to the two equations to one value for the first variable and one value for the second variable, i. e. to solve the system of two simultaneous linear equations.  Let's see how two linear equations with the same two unknowns might be related to each other.  Since we said it was given that both equations were linear, the graphs of both equations would be lines in the same two-dimensional coordinate plane (for a system with two variables).  The lines could be related to each other in the following three ways:

'''1.'''  The graphs of both equations could '''coincide''' giving the '''same line'''.  This means that the two equations are providing the same information about how the variables are related to each other.  The two equations are basically the same, perhaps just different versions or forms of each other.  Either one could be mathematically manipulated to produce the other one.  Both lines would have the same slope and the same y-intercept.  Such equations are considered '''dependent''' on each other.  Since no new information is provided, the addition of the second equation does not solve the problem by narrowing the solution set down to one solution.  

'''Example''':  Dependent linear equations

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 6x - 3y = 12 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = 2x - 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The above two equations provide the same information and result is the same graph, i. e. lines which '''coincide''' as shown in the following image.  

[[Image:Linear_equations_coincide.PNG]]

Let's see how these equations can be mathematically manipulated to show they are basically the same.
 
Divide both sides of the first equation &lt;math&gt; 6x - 3y = 12 \  &lt;/math&gt; by 3 to give
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2x -y = 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:::: Now add y to both sides 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2x = 4 + y \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:::: Now subtract 4 from both sides

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = 2x - 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is the same as the second equation in the example.  This is the slope-intercept form of the equation, from which a slope and a y-intercept unique to the line can be compared with any other equations in the slope-intercept form.  

'''2.'''  The graphs of two lines could be '''parallel''' although not the same.  The two lines do not intersect each other at any point.  This means there is no solution which satisfies both equations simultaneously, i. e. at the same time.  The solution set for this system of simultaneous linear equations is the empty set.  Such equations are considered '''inconsistent''' with each other and actually give contradictory information if it is claimed they are both true at the same time in the same problem.  The parallel lines have equal slopes but different y-intercepts.  

Sets of equations which have at least one common point which might provide a solution set are '''consistent''' with each other.  For example, the dependent equations mentioned previously are consistent with each other.

'''Example''':  Inconsistent linear equations 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 3x - 2y = -2 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 3x -2y = 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

To compare slopes and y-intercepts for these two linear equations, we place them in the slope-intercept forms.  Subtract 3x from both sides of both equations.  
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 3x - 2y = -2 \qquad  \qquad  3x -2y = 2 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-2y = -3x - 2 \qquad \qquad -2y = -3x + 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Divide both sides of both equations by -2 and simplify to get slope-intercept forms for comparison.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (-2y)/(-2) = (-3x - 2)/(-2) \qquad  (-2y)/(-2) = (-3x + 2)/(-2) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{3}{2} x + 1 \qquad  \qquad \qquad  \qquad \qquad  
 y = \frac{3}{2} x - 1&lt;/math&gt;
Now, both slopes are equal at 3/2, but the y-intercepts at 1 and -1 are different.  &lt;br&gt;The lines are parallel.  The graphs are shown here:

[[Image:Parallel_linear_equations.PNG]]

'''3.'''  If the two lines are not the same and are not parallel, then they would intersect at one point because they are graphed in the same two-dimensional coordinate plane.  The one point of intersection is the ordered pair of numbers which is the solution to the system of two linear equations and two unknowns.  The two equations provide enough information to solve the problem and further equations are not needed.  Such equations intersecting at a point providing a solution to the problem are considered '''independent''' of each other.  The lines have different slopes but may or may not have the same y-intercept.  Because such equations provide at least one solution point, they are '''consistent''' with each other.  

'''Example''':  Consistent independent linear equations

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = 3x - 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = -x - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Both of these equations are given in the slope-intercept, so it is easy to compare slopes and y-intercepts.  For these two linear functions, both slopes are different and both y-intercepts are different.  This means the lines are neither dependent nor inconsistent, so on a two-dimensional graph they must intersect at some point.  In fact, the graph shows the lines intersecting at (1,-2), which is the ordered pair solution to this system of independent simultaneous equations.  Visual inspection of a graph cannot be relied on to give perfectly accurate coordinates every time, so either the point is tested with both equations or one of the following two methods is used to determine accurate coordinates for the intersection point.

[[Image:Independent_equation_intersecting_lines.PNG]]

==Solving Linear Simultaneous Equations==

Two ways to solve a system of linear equations are presented here, the addition method and the substitution method.  Examples will show how two &lt;u&gt;independent&lt;/u&gt; linear simultaneous equations with two unknown variables could be solved for both unknown variables using these methods.  

===Elimination by Addition Method===

The '''elimination by addition''' method is often simply called the '''addition''' method.  Using the addition method, one of the equations is &lt;u&gt;added (or subtracted)&lt;/u&gt; to the other equation(s), usually after multiplying the entire equation by a constant, in order to &lt;u&gt;eliminate&lt;/u&gt; one of the unknowns.  If&amp;nbsp;the equations are independent, then the resulting equation(s) should be one(s) which will have one less unknown.  For an original system of two equations and two unknowns, the resulting equation with one less unknown would have one unknown left which could easily be solved for.  For systems with more than two equations and two unknowns, the process of elimination by addition continues until an equation with one unknown results.  This unknown could then be solved for and the solved value then substituted into the other equations resulting in a system with one less unknown.  The elimination by addition process is repeated until all of the unknowns are solved.

If a system has two equations which are dependent, then the addition of the equations could or would eliminate both unknowns at once.  If the equations are parallel lines which are inconsistent, then a contradictory equation could result.  The addition method is useful for solving systems of simultaneous &lt;u&gt;linear&lt;/u&gt; equations, particularly if the equations are given in the form Ax + By = C, where x and y are the two unknown variables and A, B, and C are constants.  

'''Example''':  Solve the following system of two equations for unknowns x and y using the addition method:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x + 2y = 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 3x - y = 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Solution''':  We can either multiply the first equation by -3 and add the result to the second equation to eliminate x,  or  we can multiply the second equation by 2 and add the result to the first equation to eliminate y.  Let's multiply [both sides of ] the second equation by 2. 

:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot (3x - y) = 2 \cdot 5 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot 3x - 2 \cdot y = 10 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 6x \  - 2y = 10 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now we &lt;u&gt;add&lt;/u&gt; this resulting equation to the first equation; i. e. each of the two sides of the equations are added together to give a combined equation as shown here:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x \  + \  2y = 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; + \  ( 6x - 2y = 10 ) \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;_____________________&lt;/center&gt;
:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 7x + 0\cdot y = 14 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This means that we add x + 2y and 6x - 2y to get 7x + 0&amp;middot;y &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; we add 4 and 10 to get 14.

This &lt;u&gt;eliminates&lt;/u&gt; y from the combined equation to give an equation in x only:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;       7x = 14   \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

::::Now we solve for x:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;        x = 14/7 = 2   \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now that we have x, we can substitute the value for x into either of the original two equations and then solve for y.  Let's pick the first equation for the substitution into x.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2 + 2y = 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:::::Solving for y:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  2y = 4 - 2 = 2\ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = 2/2 = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So the solution set consists of the ordered pair ( 2,1) which is the point of intersection for the two linear functions as shown here:

[[Image:Two_linear_equation_add_method.PNG]]

===Elimination by Substitution Method===

The '''elimination by substitution''' method is often simply called the '''substitution''' method.  With the substitution method, one of the equations is solved for one of the unknowns in terms of the other unknown(s).  Then that expression for the first unknown is &lt;u&gt;substituted&lt;/u&gt; into the other equation(s) to &lt;u&gt;eliminate&lt;/u&gt; it such that the equation(s) then have only the other unknown(s) left.  If&amp;nbsp;the equations are independent, then the resulting equation(s) should be one(s) which will have one less unknown.  For an original system of two equations and two unknowns, the resulting equation with one less unknown would have one unknown left which could easily be solved for.  For systems with more than two equations and two unknowns, the process of elimination by substitution is repeated until an equation with one unknown results.  This unknown could then be solved for and the solved value then substituted into the other equation(s), resulting in a system with one less unknown.  The process of elimination by substitution continues until all of the unknowns are solved.

If a system has two equations which are dependent, then applying the substitution method would either eliminate two unknowns at once or result in an equation which do not yield single values for the remaining unknown(s).  If the equations are parallel lines which are inconsistent, then a contradictory equation could result.

'''Example''':  Solve the following system of two equations for unknowns x and y using the substitution method:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x - y = -1 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x + 2y = -4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Solution''':  We can start by solving for either x or y in terms of the other unknown in either one of the equations.  Let's start by solving for x in terms of y in the first equation.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x = y - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Next, we &lt;u&gt;substitute&lt;/u&gt; this expression for x into the other equation in order to &lt;u&gt;eliminate&lt;/u&gt; x from the equation.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (y - 1) + 2y = -4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 3y - 1 = -4 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We have eliminated x and now we have an equation in terms of y only.  We now solve for y in this equation.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 3y = -4 + 1 = -3 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = -3/3 = -1 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We have found the solution for y to be -1.  We substitute this value for y into the expression for x in terms of y we determined from the first equation earlier.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x = y - 1 = -1 - 1\ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Finally, we calculate the value of x.  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; x = -2 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So the solution set consists of the ordered pair (-2,-1) which is the point of intersection for the two linear functions as shown here:

==Slopes of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines==

*In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane, linear functions which are &lt;u&gt;dependent&lt;/u&gt; or whose graphs are &lt;u&gt;parallel lines&lt;/u&gt; will have the &lt;u&gt;same slope&lt;/u&gt;. '''CONVERSELY''', linear functions having &lt;u&gt;equal slopes&lt;/u&gt; are either &lt;u&gt;dependent&lt;/u&gt; or have graphs that are &lt;u&gt;parallel lines&lt;/u&gt; in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane.  Of course, vertical parallel lines of the general form x=c are not functions and have no defined slopes.
&lt;i&gt;This paragraph restates itself. It should be reworded.&lt;/i&gt;


*In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane, two lines that are '''perpendicular''' to each other will form '''right angles''' (90&amp;deg; angles) with each other at the point where they intersect.  When the slopes of two linear functions whose graphs are lines that are &lt;u&gt;perpendicular&lt;/u&gt; are multiplied together, the &lt;u&gt;product of the two slopes equals -1&lt;/u&gt;.  Conversely, if &lt;u&gt;multiplying the slopes&lt;/u&gt; of two linear functions gives a &lt;u&gt;product equal to -1&lt;/u&gt;, then their graphs are &lt;u&gt;perpendicular lines&lt;/u&gt; on a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane.  


:In other words, if two perpendicular lines have slopes m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_1 m_2 = -1 \  &lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

:If a pair of perpendicular lines consists of a horizontal line (of the form y = c) and a vertical line (of the form x = c), then the preceding rule does &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; apply.  A vertical line has no slope and the slope of a horizontal line = 0.  

'''Example''':  Find the slope-intercept form of a [new] line which intersects y = (1/2)x - 3 at (4,-1) and is perpendicular to it.  

'''Solution''':  First, find slope of the new line from slope of the given line.  Let m = slope of the new line.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) m = -1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\cdot \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) m  = 2\cdot (-1) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m = -2 \  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

The slope-intercept form of the new line will be:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = -2x + b \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where b is the y-intercept of the new line.  Next, solve for y-intercept of new line using the intersecting point (4,-1) and the new slope of -2.  Substitute x = 4 and y = -1 into the preceding equation and solve for b.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-1 = -2 \cdot 4 + b \  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -1 = -8 + b \ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; b = -1 + 8 = 7 \  &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Finally, the slope-intercept form of the new perpendicular line is :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = -2x + 7 \  &lt;/math&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

==Solving Systems of Simultaneous Equations Involving Equations Of Degree 2==
The substitution method should be used for efficiency when solving nonlinear simultaneous equations, unless other methods such as the graphing method provide clear and simple solutions quickly (when they would be faster than substitution).

'''Example''': Solve the system of simultaneous equations.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y^2 + (2x+3)^2 = 10 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2x + y = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

With the second equation, make a given term (here, 2x should be used) the subject.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2x = 1 - y \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Substitute the third equation into the first, and through factorization of the resulting, simplified quadratic with one variable the solutions can be found.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y^2 + ((1-y)+3)^2=10 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y^2 + (4-y)^2=10 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2y^2 - 8y + 16 =10 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(y-1)(y-3) = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Hence we know &lt;math&gt;y = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y=3 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Then, we calculate that the two possibilities are: &lt;math&gt;y = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt; or; &lt;math&gt;y = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = -1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Solving Systems of Simultaneous Equations Using a Graphing Calculator==
'''TI-83 (Plus) and TI-84 Plus:'''

1. Press &quot;Y=&quot; &lt;br&gt;
2. Enter both equations, solved for Y &lt;br&gt;
3. Press &quot;GRAPH&quot; &lt;br&gt;
4. If all intersection points are not visible, press &quot;ZOOM&quot; then 0 or select &quot;0: ZoomFit&quot; &lt;br&gt;
5. Press &quot;2nd&quot; then &quot;TRACE&quot; &lt;br&gt;
6. Press 5 or select &quot;5: intersect&quot; &lt;br&gt;
7. Move the cursor to one of the intersection points. (There may be only one) Each of these points represents one solution to the system. &lt;br&gt;
8. Press &quot;ENTER&quot; three times &lt;br&gt;
9. The coordinates of the intersection are shown at the bottom of the screen. Repeat steps 5-8 for other solutions. &lt;br&gt;

'''TI-89 (Titanium):'''

via Graphing:

1. Press the green &quot;diamond key&quot;, located directly beneath the &quot;2nd&quot; (blue) button. &lt;br&gt;
2. Follow steps 2-5 as listed above. To access &quot;Y=&quot; and &quot;GRAPH&quot;, press the green &quot;diamond key&quot; , then press F1 (it activates the tertiary function, &quot;Y=&quot;) and F3 ( &quot;GRAPH&quot;). To access &quot;ZOOM&quot; and &quot;TRACE&quot;, press F2 and F3 (diamond function activated), respectively. For &quot;ZoomFit&quot;, press F2, then &quot;ALPHA&quot; (white), then &quot;=&quot; (for A). &lt;br&gt;
3. To locate the point of intersection, manually use the directional keypad (arrow keys), or press F5 for &quot;Math&quot;, then 5 for &quot;Intersection&quot;. (The second option is more difficult to use, however; manual searching and zooming is recommended.) &lt;br&gt;
4. The coordinates are displayed on the bottom of the screen. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all desired solutions have been found. For new or additional equations, return to the &quot;Y=&quot; as described above.  

via Simultaneous Equation Solver:

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;This is a default App on the TI-89 Titanium. If you are using the TI-89 or no longer have the Solver, visit [http://www.education.ti.com the Texas Instruments site] for a free download.

1. On the APPS screen, select &quot;Simultaneous Equation Solver&quot; and press enter. Press &quot;3&quot; when the next screen appears. &lt;br&gt;
2. Enter the number of equations you wish to solve and the corresponding number of solutions. &lt;br&gt;
3. The two equations are represented simultaneously in a 2 x 3 matrix (assuming that you are solving two equations and searching for two solutions. The size of the matrix depends on the number of equations you wanted to solve). In the corresponding boxes, enter the coefficients/constants of your equations, pressing &quot;ENTER&quot; every time you submit a value. (Remember that all equations must be converted into standard form - Ax + By = C - first!) &lt;br&gt;
4. Once all values have been entered, press F5 to solve.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is logic?==

Logic is the study of the consistency of beliefs. For beliefs to be consistent it must be possible for them to ''obtain'' at the same time. For example, it is illogical to believe that the sky is completely blue and that the sky is completely red because the sky being entirely blue is inconsistent with its being entirely red, i.e. it ''is not possible'' for the sky to be entirely red at the same time as its being entirely blue.

Logic is also a study of &quot;logical consequence&quot;, i.e. what follows by necessity from something else. By studying inconsistency of beliefs, philosophers are able to study the ''validity of arguments'', as will be shown later. Methods of finding whether certain arguments are valid is described later.

The symbolisation of these sentences, known as formalisation, simplifies and quickens this process. It also enables the philosopher to clarify ideas using an unambiguous language in which to represent thoughts. The sophistication of the language used enables greater insights into the significance of these thoughts (and a cursory analysis of more logical languages is described in [[Other Logics (Introduction to Philosophical Logic)|Other Logics]].

==Aims of this book==

This book aims to give the reader a basic understanding of logic and its relationship with philosophy, rather than a more mathematical approach to advanced logic. It is designed to provide the reader with a grasp of terms such as &quot;valid&quot;, &quot;consistency&quot;, &quot;entailment&quot;, which often arise in philosophy, to help the reader comprehend the philosophical issues that use them. Philosophical debates of certain issues are not developed here, and are at most briefly mentioned. Certain assumptions are made; the reader is advised to consider them. 

The final part of this book ([[Other Logics (Introduction to Philosophical Logic)|Other Logics]]) is a development and extension of the principles described herein. It is designed to interest
[[Category:Introduction to Philosophical Logic]] rather than fully inform the reader of these matters.</text>

Why do we have a section on Carnatic Music here?  It is totally unrelated to this topic.  --[[User:61.95.211.98|61.95.211.98]] 06:53, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Teaching step-by-step ==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Tamil step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Tamil than in English), common personal names, Tamil words that have entered English, English words that are used in Tamil, words that both Tamil and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Tamil, I'd be glad to help you, even though I don't know Tamil. I'd like to learn it though and I can read quite a few other scripts. Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].

== 216 + 1 = 247 ?? ==

The current Introduction seems to imply that 216 + 1 = 247. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|discuss]]) 22:22, 29 May 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gender ==
Italian nouns are either masculine or feminine.

As a general rule (with a few exceptions), male human beings are associated to masculine nouns; female human beings are associated to feminine nouns. Collective nouns, referring to a group of human beings of both genders, are usually masculine.

&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 Attore (''actor'') is masculine. (è maschile)
 Attrice (''actress'') is feminine. (è femminile)
 Maestro (male ''teacher'') is masculine.
 Maestra (female ''teacher'') is feminine.
 Bambini (''children'', a group of little boys) is masculine
 Bambini (''children'', a mixed group of little boys and girls) is masculine
 Bambine (''children'', a group of little girls) is feminine

&lt;b&gt;Exceptions (example):&lt;/b&gt;
 Persona (''person'' - man or woman) is feminine

Animals and things may be masculine or feminine, but there is no clear rule for this association. When you learn a new word, you should learn whether it is masculine or feminine.

&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 Pietra (''stone'') is feminine.
 Sasso (also ''stone'') is masculine.
 Topo (''mouse'') is masculine.
 Volpe (''fox'') is feminine.

The basic rule is that masculine singular nouns end with -o, feminine singular nouns end with -a. Most words follow this form, but this is not always the case.

*Masculine singular nouns can end in -a (rare)
*Feminine singular nouns can end in -o (rare)
*Both masculine and feminine nouns can end with -e
*Nouns ending in -à are always feminine
*Nouns ending in -è are always masculine
*Nouns ending in -i and in -ù are usually feminine
*Nouns ending in -ione are usually feminine
*Nouns ending in -mma are usually Greek in origin and masculine

&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;
 Uomo (''man'') is masculine.
 Donna (''woman'') is feminine.
 Mano (''hand'') is feminine.
 Programma (''program'') is masculine.
 Cane (''dog'') is masculine.
 Pace (''peace'') is feminine.
 Città (''town'') is feminine.
 Crisi (''crisis'') is feminine.
 Virtù (''virtue'') is feminine.

==Plural==
In Italian, nouns are pluralized by a change in the last vowel.

In short:
* Nouns ending with -a are pluralized with -e if feminine (most common) or with -i if masculine.
* Nouns ending with -e or -o are pluralized with -i.
* Nouns ending with a stressed vowel, with -i or -u or with a consonant are invariant, the plural is the same as the singular.

Every case:
* Feminine in -a, plural in -e
* Feminine in -e, plural in -i
* Feminine in -o, plural in -i
* Feminine in -ie, plural in -ie
* Feminine in -i, plural also in -i
* Masculine in -a, plural in -i
* Masculine in -o, plural in -i (rarely, plural in -a; see Special Plurals below)
* Masculine in -e, plural in -i

&lt;b&gt;A basic example&lt;/b&gt;:
 [Il] ragazzo (''boy'') is masculine singular.
 - [I] ragazzi is the plural form.
 [La] ragazza (''girl'') is feminine singular.
 - [Le] ragazze is the plural form.

&lt;b&gt;Other examples&lt;/b&gt;:
 [Il] programma (''program'', masculine).  Plural: [i] programmi.
 [La] mano (''hand'', feminine).  Plural: [le] mani.
 [Il] cane (''dog'', masculine). Plural: [i] cani.
 [La] canzone (''song'', feminine). Plural: [le] canzoni.
 [La] crisi (''crisis'', feminine). Plural: [le] crisi.
 [La] città (''town'', feminine). Plural: [le] città.
 [Il] caffè (''coffee'', masculine). Plural: [i] caffè.
 [La] virtù (''virtue'', feminine). Plural: [le] virtù.
 [Il] gas (''gas''). Plural: [i] gas.

'''''Warning'''''.&lt;br&gt;
In some cases, plural feminine forms can be mistaken for singular masculine forms.

&lt;b&gt;Example of confusing forms.&lt;/b&gt;
 [Il] signore (''mister'') is masculine singular.
 - [I] signori is the plural form.
 [La] signora (''mrs'') is feminine singular.
 - [Le] signore is the plural form.

The problem here is that &quot;signore&quot; can refer to both one man or two (or more) women.  This problem is usually solved by taking the article into account.

==Special plurals==
A number of masculine nouns ending in -o have special plurals ending in -a; these special plurals switch to feminine gender. They are a remnant of the old Latin neutral gender.

&lt;b&gt;Examples of plurals in -a:&lt;/b&gt;
 [Il] braccio (''arm'', masculine). Plural: [le] braccia (feminine)
 [L'] uovo (''egg'', masculine). Plural: [le] uova (feminine)

Very few nouns have irregular plurals.

&lt;b&gt;Irregular plurals (example):&lt;/b&gt;
 Uomo (''man''), plural: uomini

Some nouns are invariant (the plural is the same as the singular) even if they end in -a, -e or -o. These nouns are usually originated by a shortening of longer names.

&lt;b&gt; Invariant plurals i -a, -e or -o (example):&lt;/b&gt;
 [La] moto (short for motocicletta) (''motorcycle''). Plural: [le] moto

Nouns ending with i+vowel in some cases miss one i in the plural (a rule for masculine nouns).

&lt;b&gt;Examples of plurals for nouns in -ia, -io:&lt;/b&gt;
 Camicia (''shirt'', fem.). Plural: camicie
 Doccia (''shower'', fem.). Plural: docce
 Arancia (''orange'', fem.). Plural: arance
 Inizio (''start'', masc.). Plural: inizi
 Negozio (''shop'', masc.). Plural: negozi
 Raggio (''ray'', masc.). Plural: raggi

Nouns ending with -co, -go can have plurals ending with -chi, -ghi or -ci, -gi. Nouns ending with -ca, -ga usually have plurals ending with -che, -ghe.

&lt;b&gt;Examples of plurals for nouns in -co, -go, -ca, -ga:&lt;/b&gt;
 Amico (''friend'', masc.). Plural: amici
 Arco (''arch'', masc.). Plural: archi
 Lago (''lake'', masc.). Plural: laghi
 Medico (''physician'', masc.). Plural: medici
 Amica (''friend'', fem.). Plural: amiche
 Barca (''boat'', fem.). Plural: barche
 Targa (''plate'', fem.). Plural: targhe

&lt;b&gt;Particular cases -cia and -gia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Words ending with either -cia and -gia respect the following rule.

 Plural ends with -cie/-gie if the final letter before the suffix(cia/gia) is a vowel
 Plural ends with -ce/-ge if the final letter before the suffix is a consonant

If the stress falls on the i, the i always remains so, for instance, -cia makes the plural with -cie.

It contains helper classes including the Mesh + MeshLoader classes, the Effect class for manipulating the HLSL, helper classes for rendering to surfaces, and a whole lot more. Anyone wishing to develop a game (no matter how simple) will probably need this class for using meshs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The project wikibooks does not seem to be enjoying the same sort of growth that the original wikipedia did. There are probably a number of reasons for this. I shall give a few reasons I think are important and then follow up with some suggestions for the action that could be taken to remedy this.

1) Wikibooks requires a different logon to wikipedia. IMHO it would be better for the project if existing wikipedia developers could be automatically part of wikibooks. This would allow more free movement of labour from wikipedia to wikibooks. A strong motivating factor for people developing in wikipedia is the racking up of credit in the form of edited articles. Why not allow create a contributions page that gives credit to all material worked on in any wiki project?

2) Wikibooks is not interconnected in the same way that wikipedia is. There is a clear need for a different structure to the books as they are meant to be (at least eventually) printed and should therefore have a linear style. However, if links were made in such a way that they could deleted without interfering with the quality of the text then we could have the same interconnection that wikipedia has without that necessarily causing problems with the style of the books.

We need a way to designate sections as being developer areas (but within the actual text itself) We could produce a special heading &quot;Developer's notes and links&quot; which has a template (to ensure consistent usage. 
We need a special link type that represents a temporary link for development purposes. This would allow the developer links and comments necessary to speed up development. But at the same time would allow these links to be removed with ease when the wikibook is downloaded. (Of course links just to wikipedia should be fairly easy to remove automatically although it might help if they appeared in a different colour to remind developers that that material reffered to will not be available to the readers of printed versions. 
3) Also links can be made from relevent pages of wikipedia to wikibooks. This should draw in much more labour to liven up wikibooks. This is one thing that I can implement on my own. So I shall start introducing a section on some selected wikipedia pages entitled &quot;relevent wikibooks&quot;. I may also start links to wikibooks in the main text of some articles in wikipedia. However, without 2) we may find that people learn to ignore links to wikibooks as they are deadends.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Consistency and Inconsistency=

Logic is a study of the consistency of beliefs. A belief is part of a psychological state in which a person thinks, is under impression, ''believes'' that the universe has some property. They are readily represented by sentences, a linguistic interpretation. Such sentences can then be evaluated for ''truth''.

==Truth==

What is truth? What sort of thing could be considered true?

# Shut that door!
# Are you going to the party?
# Would that I were not hungry.
# A panda eats shoots and leaves.

Of the above sentences, only one, it seems, is capable of being assigned a truth value (considered true or false). The last sentence is true, but what of the others? The first is a command. It can be obeyed or disobeyed, but cannot be true (or false). The second is a question and again cannot be true or false. The third expresses a wish; it may be true that the person uttering it wishes he or she were not hungry, but it itself cannot be evaluated for truth. It shall be said that only ''declarative'' statements are evaluable for truth.

A test, perhaps, for determining if a sentence is declarative or not is to ask if the following question is a meaningful, grammatical question in English:

*Is it true that P?

where P is the sentence being analysed.

# Is it true that shut that door?
# Is it true that are you going to the party?
# Is it true that would that I were hungry?

None of the above is meaningful English. These therefore fail the test. 

So what is it for a declarative sentence to be true. There are many truth theories, each defining truth slightly differently. The definition of truth adopted in this book comes from the ''correspondence'' theory, which states that '''a sentence P is true if and only the state of affairs designated by P obtains'''; &quot;it is true that P&quot; is true if P. 
Falsehood is similarly defined for a sentence: '''a sentence is false if the state of affairs it designates do not exist'''. Although this seems straightforward and platitudinous, there are complications, explanation of which roams outside the scope of this book. The reader is urged to investigate these!

For the sake of simplicity it will be assumed that all declarative sentences are true or false and so, '''if a sentence is true, its negation is false'''. The ''negation'' of a sentence P is any sentence that shares its meaning precisely with the sentence 

'''it is not the case that P'''.

==Definition of Consistency==

Logic is concerned with the consistency of sets of sentences (used to represent beliefs) and with consistent outcomes to processing logical formulae containing operands and operatives. A set of sentences is said to be '''consistent''' if and only if '''there is at least one possible situation in which they are all true'''. So, the following set of sentences is consistent:

# Grass is green.
# It is not the case that the moon is green.
# Most humans have ten fingers.
# Grasshoppers have six legs and dogs have four.
# Earth is a cube.

Note that not all of the sentences are true (sentence 5). However, if the Earth were a cube, it need not be that any of the other sentences are false. There is a ''possible situation'' in which they are all true. In this way, logicians are not interested as such in the actual '''truth value''' of a sentence (whether it is in fact true or false), but more in a sentence's possible truth values.

Consider the following English sentences:

# The moon is entirely constituted from cheese.
# The moon is only partly constituted from cheese.

There is no possible situation in which 1 and 2 are both true, that is to say, it is impossible for them both to be true at the same moment. Such a pair of sentences are said to be inconsistent. A set of sentences is said to be '''inconsistent''' if there is '''no possible situation in which they are all true'''.

A set of sentences may consist of only one sentence. In which case, if there is a possible situation in which that sentence is true, the sentence is said to be consistent. If there is no such situation, the sentence is said to be inconsistent.

For example, &quot;grass is green&quot; and &quot;snow is blue&quot; are examples of consistent sentences (and the set containing them and only them is consistent). The sentences &quot;grass is green&quot; and &quot;grass is blue&quot; (when taken individually) are consistent sentences, but any set containing them both is inconsistent.

The sentence &quot;2+2=5&quot; is inconsistent. There is no situation in which it is true.

If two sentences cannot be both true and cannot be both false, they are said to be '''contradictory'''. For example, &quot;Socrates was a philosopher&quot; and &quot;Socrates was not a philosopher&quot; are contradictory statements.

If two sentences cannot be both true at the same time (form an inconsistent set), they are said to be contrary. For example, &quot;I have exactly 10 fingers&quot; and &quot;I have exactly 9 fingers&quot; are contrary (both statements cannot be true, but both could be false). All contradictory statements are contrary.

==Logical Possibility and Necessity==

What exactly is meant by ''possible'' where it is used above? The type of possibility being considered is ''logical''. If something is considered logically possible, it ''could have been the case that it was true'', regardless of whether it is actually true or not. So, it ''could have been true'' that Charles I was not beheaded, for example if he had evaded the executioner, or that the moon is made of cheese, if, for example, the universe was slightly different to how it actually is.

Necessity can be defined in terms of possibility. It is, for example, impossible that Charles I was both beheaded and not beheaded, i.e. it is not possible that he was beheaded and not beheaded. A statement about impossibility is a statement about ''necessity'', i.e. the way things ''must'' be. To say something is impossible is to say that no possible situation exists where it is true. If no situation exists where it is true, it ''must'' be false - it is necessarily false and so its negation is necessarily true.

# It is not the case that P is possible.
# It must be the case that it is not the case that P is true.

The reader should strive to understand that 2 follows from 1 (and indeed that 1 follows from 2) before continuing. Some examples will clarify this (and extend the idea):

# *It is not possible that two plus two makes five.
  *It must be that two plus two does not make five.

# *It is not possible that four is not the square of two.
  *It must be that four is the square of two.

# *According to the definition above, it must be that a sentence is either true or false.
  *According to the definition above, it could not be that a sentence were neither true nor false.

A sentence that describes a state of affairs that is not possible is said to be '''necessarily false'''.
A sentence the negation of which describes a state of affairs that is not possible is said to be '''necessarily true'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition of an argument==

An argument (in the context of logic) is defined as '''a set of ''premises'' and a ''conclusion'' where the conclusion and premises are separated by some trigger word, phrase or mark known as a ''turnstile''.'''

For example:

1 ''I think; therefore I am.''

There is only one premise in this argument, ''I think''. The conclusion is ''I am'' and the turnstile is ''therefore'' (although the semi-colon may be thought of as part of the turnstile).

2 ''All men are mortal. Socrates was a man. So, Socrates was mortal.''

In this example there are two premises and the turnstile is ''so''.

In English (and all other ''natural languages''), the conclusion need not come at the end of an argument:

3 ''Pigs can fly. For pigs have wings and all winged animals can fly.''

4 ''I am a safe driver: I have never had an accident.''

Here the turnstiles (''for'' and '':'') seem to indicate where the premises come as opposed to where the conclusion comes. Other examples of turnstiles (indicating either conclusion or premises) are: ''so'', ''thus'', ''hence'', ''since'', ''because'', ''it follows that'', ''for the reason that'', ''from this it can be seen that''.

==Sound arguments==

A sound argument is an argument that satisfies three conditions.
-True premises
-Unambiguous premises
-Valid logic

If one of these conditions is unsatisfied then the argument is unsound, though in the case of ambiguous premises, not necessarily so.

The first, second and fourth arguments (depending of course, on who &quot;I&quot; is - it is being assumed it is the author!) are all sound. Here are some more:

5 ''Grass is green. The sky is blue. Snow is white. Therefore coal is black.''

6 ''Grass is green. The sky is blue. Snow is white. Therefore pigs can fly.''

7 ''2+2=4; hence 2+2=4''

8 ''2+2=4; hence 2+2=5''

Note that it is not necessary that the truth value of the conclusion play a role in determining whether an argument is sound.  This can be determined by considering the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument.  However, if the conclusion is not true, the argument is not sound.

A sound argument always has consistent premises. This must be the case, since there is a possible situation (namely reality) in which they are all true.

==Valid arguments==

Of greater interest to the logician are valid arguments. A valid argument is '''an argument for which there is no possible situation in which the premises are all true and the conclusion is false'''.

Of the above arguments 2, 3 and 7 are valid. The reader should consider whether argument 1 is valid (read ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' by Descartes, chapters 1, 2).

It does not matter whether the premises or conclusion are actually true for an argument to be valid. All that matters is that the premises ''could not all be true and the conclusion false''. Indeed, this means that an argument with inconsistent premises is always valid. There is no situation under which such an argument has all premises true and so there is no situation under which such an argument has all premises true and conclusion false. Hence it is valid. Similarly, an argument with a necessary conclusion can in no situation have all true premises and a false conclusion, since there is no situation in which the conclusion is false.

An argument with the single premise 'The conclusion is true.' is valid (regardless of the conclusion). An argument with the conclusion 'The premises are all true.' is also valid.

According to the definition of truth given previously, if the conclusion is false, its negation is true. Hence a valid argument can also be defined as an argument for which there is no possible situation under which the premises and the negation of the conclusion are all true. Hence, a valid argument is an argument such that the set of its premises and the negation of the conclusion is inconsistent. Such a set (the ''union'' of the set of premises and the set of the negation of the conclusion) is known as the ''counter-example set''. It is called the counter-example set for the following reason: if a possible situation is found in which the members of this set are all true (and so the set is found to be consistent), this situation provides a ''counter-example'' to the arguments being valid, i.e. the existence of such a situation proves that the argument is not valid.

Counter-examples do not exist only for arguments, but also for statements:

''Prime numbers are always odd''		2 provides a counter-example (a number) to this statement.
''All animals have four legs''			Human beings provide a counter-example (a type of animal).
''Years are 365 days long''			Leap years provide a counter-example (a type of year).
''Years designated by a number divisible 
by four are leap years''			The year 1900 provides a counter-example (a particular year).
''It always rains in England''			A singularly sunny day in September (today, when written - a 								particular interval of time) provides a counter-example.

Counter-examples to declarative sentences refute their truth and are classes of things (''thing'' being understood very broadly here) or particular things. Counter-examples to arguments refute their validity and are possible situations designated by sets of sentences (the counter-example set). Some clarification of the situation is often needed.

For example, take argument 4. It will be modified slightly as follows:


''John has never had an accident; therefore, John is a safe driver.''

It will be assumed here that ''accident'' means car accident and ''driver means motorist and ''safe'' means not liable to cause an accident. The counter-example set is:

John has never had an accident.
John is not a safe driver.

Clarification by example: it may be that John has never driven in his life (and so never had an accident) because he is blind (and so cannot be considered a safe driver).

As mentioned, an inconsistent counter-example set implies that a conclusion is valid because it means that there is no situation under which the premises are all true and the conclusion is false (the negation of the conclusion is true).

Take argument 2; the counter-example set is:

All men are mortal.
Socrates was a man.
Socrates was not mortal.

These sentences cannot all be true at once. If Socrates was a man and he was not mortal, it could not be that all men are mortal. If all men are indeed mortal and Socrates was not mortal, he could not have been a man. If all men are mortal and Socrates was a man, he must have been mortal. Hence the counter-example set is inconsistent and the argument is valid.

Use a similar approach to show that arguments 3 and 7 are valid (and use it to consider argument 1). This method is known as ''reductio ad absurdum'' (which translates literally from Latin as &quot;reduction to absurdity&quot;). The negation of the conclusion is absurd given the truth of the premises and so the conclusion must be true.

Natural languages, such as English, are flawed. One such flaw is ''ambiguity'', another is that they are tedious to write out if they are long. However, sentences can be formalised into a symbolic, logical language that contains neither of these flaws (although, as the discerning reader will discover, natural languages have many advantages over these languages).

The first such language to be considered is the propositional calculus.

: C is a [[w:System programming|system programming]] language and has a fairly simple syntax and a small set of keywords but with an extensive set of rules attached to those. It is also one of the most used languages. C is pretty much as low-level a programming language as you can get before [[Wikipedia:Assembly language|assembly language]]. C was originally designed to program operating systems - specifically, it was designed to implement [[Wikipedia:Unix|UNIX]]. It compiles to very small executables and it is used extensively in [[Embedded Systems|embedded systems]] with limited memory. C is the basis for, or has greatly influenced many modern programming languages such as Java, C#, PHP, and Python.

:Eiffel is a pure real-world object-oriented language designed as such from the ground up in the early 1980s by Bertrand Meyer. It embodies several formal techniques, such as the use of assertions making them accessible to the programmer and designer in an integrated technique called design by contract, used to break down the functionality of software into cooperating modules (classes). The correct interaction of these modules is checked by the use of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants, integrated with the exception handling mechanism. Eiffel incorporates an elegant design of multiple inheritance and generics.

== PHP &amp;ndash; XForms ==

* [[PHP Programming|PHP]] - {{stage|25%|Oct 10, 2005}}
: PHP is a server side language that is used in the development of dynamic webpages. PHP syntax is very similar to C syntax. PHP usually uses the MySQL database server to load page information, although it can connect to other database servers like Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server.  PHP was originally based on Perl.
* [[Prolog]] - {{stage|25%|Oct 10, 2005}}
: Prolog is a language based on first-order predicate calculus - a system of expressing mathematical logic. In contrast to the more popular axiom of definitive programming, Prolog programs are declarative, which means that programmer declares a set of rules and facts and the user asks questions. It is the machine task to find a way of answering the question using the rules and facts. Learning Prolog will allow you to better understand computer assisted analysis of natural-language sentences and enhance your abilities as artificial-intelligence programmer.
* [[Python Programming]] - {{stage|50%|Oct 10, 2005}}
: Python has a very clean and readable syntax and is run through an interpreter, which makes it easy to play with small examples, the downside of this dynamism being that Python programs typically require much more testing than in other languages{{cn}}. It is used for many real world, large scale projects such as MayaVi, Google, and Zope, and has been employed by organizations such as NASA for coordinating large banks of computers--a task Python has proven well-suited for.

: Ruby is a [[w:Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], object-oriented programming language. It combines syntax inspired by Ada and Perl with Smalltalk-like object-oriented features, and also shares some features with Python, [[w:Lisp|Lisp]], [[w:Dylan programming language|Dylan]] and [[w:CLU programming language|CLU]]. Ruby is a single-pass interpreted language. Ruby is said to follow the principle of least surprise (POLS), meaning that the language typically behaves intuitively or as the programmer assumes it should.  [[w:Yukihiro Matsumoto|Yukihiro Matsumoto]], the developer of the [[w:Ruby programming language|Ruby language]], noted that his primary design consideration was to make programmers happy by reducing the menial work they must do, following the principles of good user interface design.

== Introduction ==

This section is for lighthearted reading, and to prepare the reader for the next section (learning to program).

=== What is Python ===
=== Getting Python ===
=== Editing and running Python programs ===

== Learning to program in Python ==

This section presents a series of examples and exercises of increasing depth and complexity. It sort of follows the sequence of the &quot;Python concepts&quot; section, but tosses in bits from more advanced and less advanced sections. For example, when the sample programs seem to be playing with &quot;flow control&quot; (loops etc.) the os module might be imported and used for a simple function (from ahead) and triple-quoted multiline strings might pop in (from behind). This sort of stuff is done sparingly, because you don't want to overwhelm the reader. It is necessary, however, to keep people from becoming too bored. And it can usually be ignored, unless the reader gets too curious, in which case they can turn to the section on the os module and read up a bit.

'''Economics''' is the social science studying the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. It is a complex social science that spans from mathematics to psychology. At its most basic, however, economics considers how a society provides for its needs. Its most basic need is survival; which requires food, clothing and shelter. Once those are covered, it can then look at more sophisticated commodities such as services, personal transport, entertainment, the list goes on. Today, this social science known as &quot;Economics&quot; tends to refer only to the type of economic thought which [[Political Economy|political economists]] refer to as ''Neoclassical Economics''. It developed in the 18th century based on the idea that Economics can be analysed mathematically and scientifically. 
=== What is Value? ===
A generally accepted notion of Value is the worth of goods and services as determined by markets. Thus an important part of Economics is the study of policies and activities for the generation and transfer of Value within markets in the form of goods and services. Often a measure for the worth of goods and services is units of currency such as the US Dollar, peso, etc... But, unlike the units of measurements in Physics such as Seconds for Time, there exists no absolute basis for standardizing the units for Value. Usually the value of a currency is related to the value of Gold, which in turn is valued by amount or number of goods and services that it can be exchanged for. Because the rate of production of gold in the world is slower than the rate of creation of goods and services, the relation between gold and currencies is not as strict as it used to be.

Thus, one of the most complicated and most often misunderstood parts of economy is the concept of ''value''. One of the big problems is the large number of different types of values that seem to exist, such as ''exchange-value'', ''surplus-value'', ''use-value''

The discussion of values all start with one simple question: '''What is something worth?'''

Today's most common answer is one of those answers that are so deceptively simple that it seems obvious when you know it. But then remember that it took economists more than a hundred years to figure it out: ''Something is worth whatever you think it is worth''. In 1st century BC, Publilius Syrus wrote: &quot;Something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it&quot;.

This statement needs some explanation. Take as an example two companies that are thinking of buying a new copying machine. One company does not think they will use a copying machine that much, but the other knows it will copy a lot of papers. This second company will be prepared to pay more for a copying machine than the first one. They find different ''utility'' in the object. 

The companies also have a choice of models. The first company knows that many of the papers will need to be copied on both sides. The second company knows that very few of the papers it copies will need double sided copying. Of course, the second company will not pay much more for this, while the first company will. In this example, we see that a buyer will be prepared to pay more for the increase in utility compared to alternative products. 

But how does the seller value things? Well, in pretty much the same way. Of course, most sellers today do not intend to use the object he sells himself. The utility for the seller is not as an object of usage, but as a source of income. And here again it is marginal utility that comes in. For which price can you sell the object? If you put in some more work, can you get a higher price? 

Here we also get into the resellers utility. Somebody who deals in trading will look at an object, and the utility for him is to be able to sell it again. How much work will it take, and what margins are possible?


So not only do the two different buyers have a different value on an object, the salesman puts his value on it, and the original manufacturer may have put yet another value on it. The value depends on the person who does the valuation, it is subjective.

So, how do all these subjective values turn into the price? To understand that, we must take a look at the place where things are bought and sold: [[/The market/]].

== The Market ==

The market is the place where buyers and sellers go to buy and sell. The name comes of course from those gatherings of people in towns, but today markets don't need to be physical. Not only can you have electronic marketplaces such as eBay, markets are also seen as the congregation of all people buying and selling things everywhere. This is usually named ''&quot;the market&quot;'' and referenced to as it is a thing with a will and a power of it's own. But of course, it is just the average will and opinion of all the buyers and sellers, the ''actors'', on the market that shows itself by prices rising and falling and money moving around.

=== Setting a price ===

An object's Value, worth and utility is not something fixed, but instead a subjective property of the object. This subjectivity may be a bit surprising, it is easy to imagine that something must have an objective worth being bought and sold. However this is not the case, in fact, it's the opposite.

When somebody has an item to sell, he puts a value on this item, and will not sell under that value. Likewise, when somebody wants to buy something, he will put a value on the object, and will not pay more than this. If these valuations overlap, so that the buyer's valuation is higher than the seller's valuation, the object will be sold. If the seller's valuation is higher than the buyer's, the buyer will simply say &quot;it's not worth it&quot; or the seller will say &quot;it's worth more than that&quot; and no deal will be made.

Of course, you don't haggle about price every time you buy a candy bar, but you still agree on a price. It's just that the store owner has put up a sign with a price, and you can either accept it or reject it. Neither you nor him want to haggle about something that just costs eighty cents, because it's simply not worth the effort. So even though haggling is not a necessary part of the pricing, both the buyer and seller agrees on the price, and both think they are better off after the exchange. Think about this: If you would think you would be worse off after buying something, would you buy it? Of course not, so buying and selling is an act done by free will. (Unless of course somebody is pointing a gun at you, but then it's not buying and selling, but stealing.)

Now, we know that the price ends up somewhere between the seller's valuation of the item and the buyer's valuation of the item. The question of what the price of an item will be, therefore depends on these valuations. What, then will these valuations depend on?

If an object had an intrinsic, objective worth, and both seller and buyer were aware of it, the buyer's and seller's valuation of the object would never overlap, and no deal would ever be cut, because the seller would never be willing to sell it at a price less than the objective worth [or else he would be in loss] and the buyer would never be willing to buy it at a cost higher than the objective worth [why would he?], and hence, nobody would ever sell or buy anything. The subjectiveness of value is necessary for things to be sold and bought at all.

=== Free and Regulated markets ===

The description above is of a free market, where anyone can buy and sell, and where price is set by buyer and seller alone. This is not always the case. Instead many markets are ''regulated'', to limit either the people involved or the prices or both. For example, not everyone is allowed to sell medicine, claim to be a doctor or drive a taxi. The goverment has to approve you in one way or another to make sure you know your job and are not a danger to others. In the same way, not everybody is allowed to buy firearms.  You need a clean criminal record and, in most countries, you need to show you know how to use a firearm safely.

In some cases the prices are regulated by the government. In some European countries rents are controlled by the goverment to prevent what is perceived as overcharging.

Of course, it can be said today that all markets are regulated in some way. You are, for example, not allowed to use violence, break agreements or steal. But the state setting up the rules for making the market function smoothly is not usually seen as making the market non-free.

== Money ==

Money is such an obvious and integral part of today's society, that it is sometimes difficult to imagine society without it. It's also a very abstract concept, and can be hard to grasp. It comes in many forms, from special types of sea-shells, to pigs, and via the paper and coin system to digital blips in a computer. But what is money, really?

As we have seen, people [[/Value, worth and utility|value]] things differently. But communicating this value to somebody else is a problem. The only way you can communicate this value is by comparing it with other things. But since all others, just like you, have subjective values, it becomes complex and confusing. This gets evident if we look at how value impacts on barter

=== The complexities of barter ===

{{NOTE|While barter may indicate simply a system of exchange by which goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money. This section covers only the simpler direct and immediate barter system, without intermediation or complex future planning. This can become an disingenuous comparison, in benefits and efficiency when in direct comparison with a more complex and elaborate system.&lt;br&gt;The important notions to retain is that barter is a more personalized/individualized and trust based system, with less hidden costs and harder to adulterate, especially by third parties, than any more complex system that involves any type of currency.}}

When exchanging goods by barter, you need to find something you want more than something you have, while the person you barter with has to value the thing you have more than the thing you want. There are four individual valuations that must match.

An example might clear things up: If what you really want is some shoes, and the thing you have that you want to get rid of is a chair, you have to find a shoemaker that needs a chair, or you will not get any shoes. Say that the shoemaker instead needs a lamp. Then you can find somebody else that needs a chair, and has a lamp, barter that, and then go to the shoemaker.

Now, the big problem here is that when you are to value the lamp, it is no longer what you think of the lamp that is important. It's what the shoemaker thinks of the lamp. You need to guess its average value, so that you can be reasonably sure that the shoemaker will want it. The effect of this is that you pretty much need to know how people value almost everything, since you'll be forced into bartering almost everything.

This type of direct barter system may seem to some as not very efficient, but in fact may be extremely efficient if done in the proper context and with the needed infrastructures, especially in today technological world. The reason we don't do it like that ? Well, we can only state that it is not the general norm. There are plenty of communities that still use barter systems. Bartering is also the system that is adopted as soon as any other more complex system fails or loses trust. But due to the way trade evolved with the appearance of larger markets and adoption of currency the need of an increased level of economic control and taxation become evident to ruling classes and inevitable beyond the level of city states.

=== The essence of money ===

And that, in essence, is what money is, a common value system. It is a way for you to simply quantify the value into a number and communicate this to others. Instead of having to weigh the values of the shoes against the lamp against the chair, you can set a number on it. You can say that your chair is worth five units, the lamp maker can value his lamp to three units and the shoemaker thinks his shoes are worth four units. We can now instantly and easily compare values. Trading suddenly got much easier.

But that's not all. With a common value system that is based on exchangeable entities, we can exchange these entities as payment. You can now go down with your chair to the market, sell the chair to the highest bidder, and then go with your money to the shoemaker, and buy a couple of shoes. The shoemaker in turn takes the money and goes to the lamp maker. No longer do you need to evaluate the average market value of the lamp, or cut three-way deals. All you need to do is find somebody that is willing to pay what you think your chair is worth, and find a pair of shoes that is cheap enough for you.

And it doesn't even end there! Money is storable. If you have a source of income that is seasonal you can keep the money you make during high-season and buy food for it during low season.

So, this is all money is. A common value system based on exchangeable entities. But this simple concept makes life much less complicated in so many ways.

== Supply and Demand ==
The principle of ''supply and demand'' is one of the best-known principles of economic theory. It was first posited by Jean-Baptiste Say, an 18th-century [[Political Economy/Classical Political Economy|Classical Political Economist]] who suggested that demand and supply are interrelated. His theory was that the more people want something, the higher the demand is for it and the more they will value it. So if something is in low supply but in high demand the value is increased, as it will decrease if there is an abundance or a low demand for the that item. For example: There are 100 dolls and 400 people &lt;u&gt;that want those dolls&lt;/u&gt;. Since there are more people than there are dolls, people will pay more money for them.

Alfred Marshall, a famous neoclassical economist, went further in the mid-20th century and developed a mathematical model of supply and demand. The two variables in this theory are price and quantity. The forces of demand and supply are prominent in determining the price of a commodity.

== Capital ==

Capitalism, as its name suggests, is based on the ownership of Capital. What is capital? Basically, capital is anything that can be traded for something else. Any amount of money is capital, as it can be traded for a huge variety of things. Personal items are also capital because they can be sold; houses, cars, and other bizarre items fall under this category. The ability to work can also be considered capital, or labour-power.

Karl Marx first posited that perhaps there was something that separated capital into two broad categories. Some capital is bought, and then the value is fixed; this applies for an item of clothing or food, for instance. Some may lose value and depreciate; cars fall into this category. Some capital, however, can actually produce more capital which can then be sold; this, he argued, is ''real'' capital. For example, if you have a cookie-stamper and a van, some flour, butter, and other cookie ingredients, with that capital, you could produce cookies and ship them around in the van selling them for a profit, albeit small.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Python Programming/Navigation|Setting it up|Self Help}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Python has two basic modes: normal and interactive. The normal mode is the mode where the scripted and finished &lt;code&gt;.py&lt;/code&gt; files are run in the Python interpreter. Interactive mode is a command line shell which gives immediate feedback for each statement, while running previously fed statements in active memory. As new lines are fed into the interpreter, the fed program is evaluated both in part and in whole.

To start interactive mode, simply type &quot;python&quot; without any arguments. This is a good way to play around and try variations on syntax. Python should print something like this:

 $ '''python'''
 Python 3.0b3 (r30b3:66303, Sep  8 2008, 14:01:02) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
 Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

(If Python doesn't run, make sure your path is set correctly. See [[Python Programming/Getting Python|Getting Python]].)

The &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is Python's way of telling you that you are in interactive mode. In interactive mode what you type is immediately run. Try typing &lt;tt&gt;1+1&lt;/tt&gt; in. Python will respond with &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;. Interactive mode allows you to test out and see what Python will do. If you ever feel the need to play with new Python statements, go into interactive mode and try them out.

A sample interactive session:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''5'''
 5
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print (5*7)'''
 35
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;hello&quot; * 4'''
 'hellohellohellohello'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;hello&quot;.__class__'''
 &lt;type 'str'&gt;

However, you need to be careful in the interactive environment to avoid confusion. For example, the following is a valid Python script:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
if 1:
  print(&quot;True&quot;)
print(&quot;Done&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you try to enter this as written in the interactive environment, you might be surprised by the result:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''if 1:'''
 ...   '''print(&quot;True&quot;)'''
 ... '''print(&quot;Done&quot;)'''
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 3
     print(&quot;Done&quot;)
         ^
 SyntaxError: invalid syntax

What the interpreter is saying is that the indentation of the second print was unexpected.  You should have entered a blank line to end the first (i.e., &quot;if&quot;) statement, before you started writing the next print statement.  For example, you should have entered the statements as though they were written:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if 1:
  print(&quot;True&quot;)
 
print(&quot;Done&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Which would have resulted in the following:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''if 1:'''
 ...   '''print(&quot;True&quot;)'''
 ...
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(&quot;Done&quot;)'''
 Done
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

=== Interactive mode ===

Instead of Python exiting when the program is finished, you can use the -i flag to start an interactive session.  This can be '''very''' useful for debugging and prototyping.

 python -i hello.py

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is some text rescued from another page about Python's syntax:

Python's syntax is somewhat similar to the [[Programming:C|C]] programming language.
It uses the following flow.
statement (parameters)

For example an if statement is
&lt;code&gt;
 if foo is true:
     do something
&lt;/code&gt;
notice the lack of a semicolon to end the statement, and the use of white space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A page called &quot;Programming:Python features&quot; which was just a list of data types had the following text, which duplicates what's already on this page. Some of it may be useful in this page.

'''Data Containers'''

Python has four basic types of data:

'''String'''
A sequence of alpha numeric characters which is immutable.

e.g. mystring=&quot;fourteen and five&quot; (The letters to the left are the name of the string, quotes marks denote a string, and the letters and spaces within the quotes are elements of the string)

Python has a very flexible quoting syntax. Quotes can be either single quotes (tics) or double quotes (regular quotation marks) and either can contain the other as quoted text, as follows:

'''&quot;Will's foot hurt&quot;'''

''''Ben said, &quot;Would you look at that!&quot;''''

A string may also be prefaced with the character 'r' for 'raw', which means that escape characters will be taken as literals.

''''This string contains \n a newline''''

'''r'This string contains just a \n slash and an en''''

Either quote may also be used tripled to contain any characters, including newlines, as below:

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Most Python methods and objects

are commented in blocks surrounded
by tripled quotes, like this.

&quot;&quot;&quot;

'''List'''

A sequence of elements, either strings, numbers or other objects.

e.g. mylist=[1,3,&quot;four&quot;, Python.class]
The square brackets denote a list, and the enclosed items are elements (of various types) within the list. Lists are mutable, i.e. they can be concatenated or added together, with the result being a list.

'''Dictionary'''

Dictionaries are arrays which are indexed more flexibly than simply with an integer. A dictionary contains pairs in the form (key, value). The keys in these key-value pairs can be most Python objects, with a few exceptions you don't need to worry about until you've got more of the language behind you. The values can be any Python object, as far as I know.  Dictionaries are represented with curly braces - {}

A dictionary is declared like this:

person = {'name':'Phil', 'address':'1234 Blue Lane', 'spouse':anotherPerson}

The values are accessed in a number of ways, but the most common are:

aName = person['name'] (stores the value 'Phil' in aName)

person['shoesize']= 9 (stores the value 9 in the new key 'shoesize')

'''Tuple'''

A tuple is a sequence of values much like a list, except that it is immutable, like a string. Tuples are represented by parentheses, like this:

(1,2,3,'a',anObject)

A tuple can be a sequence of length one, but the literal form has a trailing comma so the interpreter can tell what you're doing:

(1,)

== Right out? ==

Maybe somebody should clarify that.  I don't think &quot;right out&quot; is a common phrase and it could be confusing.</text>

Welcome to Python! This tutorial will show you how to start writing programs.

Python programs are nothing more than text files, and they may be edited with a standard [[w:Text editor|text editor]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes, Python programs are distributed in compiled form. We won't have to worry about that for quite a while.&lt;/ref&gt; What text editor you use will probably depend on your operating system: any text editor can create Python programs. However, it is easier to use a text editor that includes Python [[w:Syntax highlighting|syntax highlighting]].  


== Hello, World! ==

The first program that beginning programmers usually write is the [[w:&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program|&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program]]. This program simply outputs the phrase &quot;Hello, World!&quot; then terminates itself. Let's write &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in Python!

Open up your text editor and create a new file called &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; containing just this line (you can copy-paste if you want):

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print('Hello, world!')
&lt;/source&gt;

This program uses the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function, which simply outputs its parameters to the terminal. By default, &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; appends a &lt;code&gt;newline&lt;/code&gt; character to its output, which simply moves the cursor to the next line.

{{NOTE|In Python 2.x, print is a statement rather than a function.  As such, it can be used without parentheses, in which case it prints everything until the end of the line and accepts a standalone comma after the final item on the line to indicate a multi-line statement. In Python 3.x, print is a proper function expecting its arguments inside parentheses. Using print with parentheses (as above) is compatible with Python 2.x and using this style ensures version-independence.}}


Now that you've written your first program, let's run it in Python! This process differs slightly depending on your operating system.

=== Windows ===

*Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs, such as &lt;code&gt;C:\pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt;, and save your &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; program in that folder.
*In the Start menu, select &quot;Run...&quot;, and type in &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt;. This will cause the Windows terminal to open.
*Type &lt;code&gt;cd \pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; to '''c'''hange '''d'''irectory to your &lt;code&gt;pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; folder, and hit Enter.
*Type &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; to run your program!

If it didn't work, make sure your PATH contains the python directory. See [[Python Programming/Getting Python|Getting Python]].

=== Mac ===
*Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs. A good suggestion would be to name it &lt;code&gt;pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; and place it in your Home folder (the one that contains folders for Documents, Movies, Music, Pictures, etc). Save your &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; program into this folder.
*Open the Applications folder, go into the Utilities folder, and open the Terminal program.
*Type &lt;code&gt;cd pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; to '''c'''hange '''d'''irectory to your &lt;code&gt;pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; folder, and hit Enter.
*Type &lt;code&gt;python ./hello.py&lt;/code&gt; to run your program!

{{NOTE|If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed (Your machine comes with a version of Python 2 but you can install [https://www.python.org/downloads/ Python 3] as well), you should run &lt;code&gt;python3 hello.py&lt;/code&gt;}}

=== Linux ===
*Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs, such as &lt;code&gt;~/pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt;, and save your &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; program in that folder..
*Open up the terminal program. In KDE, open the main menu and select &quot;Run Command...&quot; to open Konsole. In GNOME, open the main menu, open the Applications folder, open the Accessories folder,  and select Terminal.
*Type &lt;code&gt;cd ~/pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; to '''c'''hange '''d'''irectory to your &lt;code&gt;pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; folder, and hit Enter.
*Type &lt;code&gt;python ./hello.py&lt;/code&gt; to run your program!

{{NOTE|If you have both Python version 2.6.1 and Python 3.0 installed (Very possible if you are using Ubuntu, and ran '''sudo apt-get install python3''' to have python3 installed), you should run &lt;code&gt;python3 hello.py&lt;/code&gt;}}

=== Linux (advanced) ===

*Create a folder on your computer to use for your Python programs, such as &lt;code&gt;~/pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt;.

* Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; containing just the following 2 lines (you can copy-paste if you want):&lt;ref&gt;
[[A Quick Introduction to Unix/My First Shell Script]] explains what a hash bang line does.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
#! /usr/bin/python
print('Hello, world!')
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|If you have both python version 2.6.1 and version 3.0 installed (Very possible if you are using a debian or debian-based(*buntu, Mint, …) distro, and ran '''sudo apt-get install python3''' to have python3 installed),
use
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
#! /usr/bin/python3
print('Hello, world!')
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

* save your &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; program in the &lt;code&gt;~/pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; folder.
*Open up the terminal program. In KDE, open the main menu and select &quot;Run Command...&quot; to open Konsole. In GNOME, open the main menu, open the Applications folder, open the Accessories folder,  and select Terminal.
*Type &lt;code&gt;cd ~/pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; to '''c'''hange '''d'''irectory to your &lt;code&gt;pythonpractice&lt;/code&gt; folder, and hit Enter.
*Type &lt;code&gt;chmod a+x hello.py&lt;/code&gt; to tell Linux that it is an executable program.
*Type &lt;code&gt;./hello.py&lt;/code&gt; to run your program!
*In addition, you can also use &lt;code&gt;ln -s hello.py /usr/bin/hello&lt;/code&gt; to make a '''s'''ymbolic '''l'''i'''n'''k &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; under the name &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;, then run it by simply executing &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;. 

Note that this mainly should be done for complete, compiled programs, if you have a script that you made and use frequently, then it might be a good idea to put it somewhere in your home directory and put a link to it in /usr/bin. If you want a playground, a good idea is to invoke &lt;code&gt;mkdir ~/.local/bin&lt;/code&gt; and then put scripts in there. To make ~/.local/bin content executable the same way /usr/bin does type &lt;code&gt;$PATH = $PATH:~/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; (you can add this line to your shell rc file, for example ~/.bashrc).
{{NOTE|File extensions aren't necessary in UNIX-like file-systems. To linux, hello.py means the exact same thing as hello.txt, hello.mp3, or just hello. Linux mostly uses the contents of the file to determine what type it is.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
johndoe@linuxbox ~ $ file /usr/bin/hello
/usr/bin/hello: Python script, ASCII text executable
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

=== Result ===

The program should print:
 Hello, world!
Congratulations! You're well on your way to becoming a Python programmer.

== Exercises ==

#Modify the &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; program to say hello to someone from your family or your friends (or to [[w:Ada Lovelace|Ada Lovelace]]).
#Change the program so that after the greeting, it asks, &quot;How did you get here?&quot;.
#Re-write the original program to use two &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements: one for &quot;Hello&quot; and one for &quot;world&quot;. The program should still only print out on one line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Merge Sort==
&lt;!-- Should probably be replaced with something more technical/mathematical/programming-like --&gt;
You start with an unordered sequence. You create N empty queues. You loop over every item to be sorted. On each loop iteration, you look at the last element in the key. You move that item into the end of the queue which corresponds to that element. When you are finished looping you concatenate all the queues together into another sequence. You then reapply the procedure described but look at the second last element in the key. You keep doing this until you have looped over every key. When you complete this process the resulting sequence will be sorted as described above.

=== Key Comparing ===
Keys are compared in the following way:
Let k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; be the key of the one item, called item A, let k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; be the key of the other item, called item B. Let k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(i) be the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; entry in the key k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, where the first entry is at index 0.
Let i = 0.
If the keys are less than i elements long then the keys are equal.
If k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(i) &lt; k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(i), then item A is ordered before item B.
If k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(i) &gt; k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(i), then item B is ordered before item A.
If k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(i) = k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(i), then add one to i, and return the line under &quot;Let i = 0.&quot;

=== Time Cost ===

Let n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of items in the sequence to be sorted. N is number of integers that each key element can take. Let n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of keys in each item.

&lt;!-- Should explain why the time is this --&gt;
The total time to sort the sequence is thus O(n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + N)).

=== [[Common Lisp|Common Lisp]] ===
Naive implementation, translation of pseudocode found at Wikipedia.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defmacro
  apenda-primeiro (ret1 left1)
  &quot;Appends first element of left1 to right1, and removes first element from left1.&quot;
  `(progn
    (setf ,ret1 (if (eq ,ret1 nil) (cons (car ,left1) nil) (append ,ret1 (cons (car ,left1) nil))))
    (setf ,left1 (cdr ,left1))))

(defun
    merge-func (left right)
  &quot;Our very own merge function, takes two lists, left and right, as arguments, and returns a new merged list.&quot;
  (let (ret)
    (loop
      (if (or (not (null left)) (not (null right)))

               (if (not (null right))
                   (apenda-primeiro ret right)))))
        (return)))
    ret))
(defun
    merge-sort (m)
  &quot;Merge-sort proper. Takes a list m as input and returns a new, sorted list; doesn't touch the input.&quot;
  (let* ((tam (length m))
         (mid (ceiling (/ tam 2)))
         (left)
         (right))
    (if (&lt;= tam 1)
        m
      (progn
       (loop for n from 0 to (- mid 1) do
         (apenda-primeiro left m))
       (loop for n from mid to (- tam 1) do
         (apenda-primeiro right m))
       (setf left (merge-sort left))
       (setf right (merge-sort right))
       (merge-func left right)))))

&lt;/source&gt;



Simpler Implementation in a somewhat more functional style.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun sort-func (frst scond &amp;optional (sorted nil))
  &quot;Sorts the elements from the first and second list in ascending order and puts them in `sorted`&quot;
  (cond ((and (null frst) (null scond)) sorted)
        ((null frst) (append (reverse sorted) scond))
        ((null scond) (append (reverse sorted) frst))
        (t (let ((x (first frst))
                 (y (first scond)))
             (if (&lt; x y)
                 (sort-func (rest frst) scond (push x sorted))
                 (sort-func frst (rest scond) (push y sorted)))))))

(defun merge-sort (lst)
  &quot;Divides the elements in `lst` into individual elements and sorts them&quot;
  (when (not (null lst))
    (let ((divided (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (list x)) lst)))
      (labels ((merge-func (div-list &amp;optional (combined '())) ; merges the elements in ascending order
                 (if div-list
                     (merge-func (rest (rest div-list)) (push (sort-func (first div-list) (second div-list)) combined))
                     combined))
               (final-merge (div-list) ; runs merge-func until all elements have been reconciled
                 (if (&gt; (length div-list) 1)
                     (final-merge (merge-func div-list))

===[[C++|C++]]===

Here is a recursive implementation of the merge sort using STL vectors (This is a naive implementation):

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
//! \brief Performs a recursive merge sort on the given vector
//! \param vec The vector to be sorted using the merge sort
//! \return The sorted resultant vector after merge sort is
//! complete.
vector&lt;int&gt; merge_sort(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec)
{
    // Termination condition: List is completely sorted if it
    // only contains a single element.
    if(vec.size() == 1)
    {
        return vec;
    }

    // Determine the location of the middle element in the vector
    std::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator middle = vec.begin() + (vec.size() / 2);

    vector&lt;int&gt; left(vec.begin(), middle);
    vector&lt;int&gt; right(middle, vec.end());

    // Perform a merge sort on the two smaller vectors
    left = merge_sort(left);
    right = merge_sort(right);

    return merge(vec,left, right);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the implementation of the merge function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
//! \brief Merges two sorted vectors into one sorted vector
//! \param left A sorted vector of integers
//! \param right A sorted vector of integers
//! \return A sorted vector that is the result of merging two sorted
//! vectors.
vector&lt;int&gt; merge(vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;vec,const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; left, const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; right)
{
    // Fill the resultant vector with sorted results from both vectors
    vector&lt;int&gt; result;
    unsigned left_it = 0, right_it = 0;

    while(left_it &lt; left.size() &amp;&amp; right_it &lt; right.size())
    {
        // If the left value is smaller than the right it goes next
        // into the resultant vector
        if(left[left_it] &lt; right[right_it])
        {
            result.push_back(left[left_it]);
            left_it++;
        }
        else
        {
            result.push_back(right[right_it]);
            right_it++;
        }
    }

    // Push the remaining data from both vectors onto the resultant
    while(left_it &lt; left.size())
    {
        result.push_back(left[left_it]);
        left_it++;
    }

    while(right_it &lt; right.size())
    {
        result.push_back(right[right_it]);
        right_it++;
    }
    //show merge process..
      int i;
      for(i=0;i&lt;result.size();i++)
         {                                
	     cout&lt;&lt;result[i]&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;;
         }
    // break each line for display purposes..
        cout&lt;&lt;&quot;***********&quot;&lt;&lt;endl; 

    //take a source vector and parse the result to it. then return it.  
	vec = result;				
	return vec;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Here's another recursive implementation of the mergesort using arrays of variable length

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void merge(int a[], const int low, const int mid, const int high)

	{

		}
	}
	// Prints into the original array
	for(k=0;k&lt;=high-low;k++) 
	{
		a[k+low]=b[k];
	}
	delete[] b;
}

void merge_sort( int a[], const int low, const int high )		// Recursive sort ...
{
	int mid;
	if( low &lt; high )
	{
		mid = ( low + high ) / 2;
		merge_sort( a, low, mid );
		merge_sort( a, mid + 1, high );
		merge( a, low, mid, high );
	}
}

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
	int arraySize;
	// a[] is the array to be sorted. ArraySize is the size of a[] ...
	merge_sort(a, 0, (arraySize-1) );        // would be more natural to use merge_sort(a, 0, arraySize ), so please try ;-)

	// some work

Singly Linked Lists are a type of data structure. It is a type of list. In a singly linked list each node in the list stores the contents of the node and a pointer or reference to the next node in the list. It does not store any pointer or reference to the previous node. It is called a singly linked list because each node only has a single link to another node. To store a single linked list, you only need to store a reference or pointer to the first node in that list. The last node has a pointer to nothingness to indicate that it is the last node.

1. ''Modify the &lt;tt&gt;hello.py&lt;/tt&gt; program to say hello to a historical political leader (or to [[w:Ada Lovelace|Ada Lovelace]]).''

This is just a matter of replacing ''world'' with a different name, for example:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print('Hello, Ada!')
&lt;/source&gt;

2. ''Change the program so that after the greeting, it asks, &quot;How did you get here?&quot;.''

This can be accomplished by adding a second print statement:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print('Hello, Ada!')
print('How did you get here?')
&lt;/source&gt;

3. ''Re-write the original program to use two print statements: one for &quot;Hello&quot; and one for &quot;world&quot;. The program should still only print out on one line.''

This can be accomplished by passing the end parameter in the first print statement, and telling it to finish the output with a space.(Python 3) 
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print ('Hello,', end=' ')
print ('world!')
&lt;/source&gt;

When using Python 2.6 and up, you can use the ',' operator to prevent print from inserting a newline at the end.The',' instead inserts a space at the end of the string to be printed.  When using print as a function, the comma is placed outside the parentheses (Python 2.7.5).
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print 'Hello,',
print 'world!'
&lt;/source&gt;

&amp;lsaquo;&lt;small&gt; [[Australian History/First Settlers|Back to First Settlers]]&lt;/small&gt;

Prior to the arrival in Australia of Captain James Cook, Australia has been the focus both of European mythology, as Terra Australis. Similarly, contrary to popular mythology, a number of non-Indigenous explorers have travelled to Australia prior to Captain Cook's 'discovery' of the continent.

==Terra Australis==
The term &quot;Terra Australis&quot; was first introduced by Aristotle. Aristotle's ideas were later expanded by Ptolemy, a Greek cartographer from the first century AD, who believed that the Indian Ocean was enclosed on the south by land. When, during the Renaissance, Ptolemy became the main source of information for European cartographers, the land started to appear on their maps. Although voyages of discovery sometimes did reduce the area where the continent could be found, cartographers kept drawing it on their maps and scientists argued for its existence with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the south as a counterweight against the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. Usually the land was shown as a continent around the South Pole, but much larger than the actual Antarctica, spreading far north in particular in the Pacific Ocean area. New Zealand, discovered by Abel Tasman in 1642, was by some regarded as a part of the continent as well as Africa and Australia.

The idea of Terra Australis was finally corrected by James Cook. On his first voyage he circumnavigated New Zealand, showing it could not be part of a large continent. On his second voyage he circumnavigated the globe at a very high southern latitude, at some places even crossing the south polar circle, showing that any possible southern continent must lie well within the cold polar areas, and not in regions with a temperate climate as had been thought before.

==Key Explorers==
===Marco Polo and Cristóvão de Mendonça===
In about 1300, '''Marco Polo''' made reference to the reputed existence of a vast southern continent, although there is no evidence that he had specific knowledge of Australia. Some writers have suggested that maps compiled in Europe from the late 1400s show parts of the Australian coastline. Some believe that Australia was sighted by a Portuguese expedition led by '''Cristóvão de Mendonça''' in about 1522. A number of relics and remains have been interpreted as evidence that the Portuguese reached Australia in the early to mid 1500s, 200 years before Cook. These clues include the Mahogany Ship, an alleged Portuguese caravel that was shipwrecked six miles west of Warrnambool, Victoria (although its remains have never been found); a stone house at Bittangabee Bay; the so-called Dieppe map, a secret map drawn by the Portuguese; a cannon and five keys found near Geelong. Most historians do not accept these relics as proof that the Portuguese discovered Australia.

=== Binot Paulmyer===
The French navigator '''Binot Paulmyer''' claimed to have landed at Australia in 1503, after being blown off course. However later investigators concluded it was more likely he was in Madagascar. French authorities again made such a claim in 1531.

=== Luis Vaez de Torres===
'''Luis Vaez de Torres''' was the first of the 17th century Portuguese maritime explorers. A Portuguese expedition commanded by de Torres and piloted by '''Pedro Fernandez de Quiros''' set out for Australia in 1605. They sailed from east to west along the southern coast of Papua, and sighted the islands of Torres Strait. When de Quiros landed on the New Hebrides, he named the island group &quot;Austrialia del Espiritu Santo&quot;, translated as &quot;South Land of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

The first undisputed sighting of Australia by a European was made in 1606. The Dutch vessel ''Duyfken'', captained by '''Willem Jansz''', explored perhaps 350km of western side of Cape York, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Dutch made one landing, but were promptly attacked by Aboriginals and subsequently abandoned further exploration.

=== Dirk Hartog===
In 1616 '''Dirk Hartog''' landed on what is now called Dirk Hartog Island, off the coast of Western Australia, and left behind an inscription on a pewter plate. (This plate may now be seen in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.) The Dutch named the western half of the continent New Holland, but made no attempt to colonise it. Further voyages by Dutch ships explored the north coast of Australia between 1623 and 1636, giving Arnhem Land its present-day name.

=== Abel Tasman===
In 1642, '''Abel Tasman''' sailed on a famous voyage from Batavia (now Jakarta), to Papua New Guinea, Fiji, New Zealand and, on November 24, sighted Tasmania. He named it Van Diemen's Land, after Anthony van Diemen, the Dutch East India Company's Governor General at Batavia, who had commissioned his voyage. Tasman claimed Van Diemen's Land for the Netherlands.

The discovery that sailing east from the Cape of Good Hope until land was sighted, and then sailing north along the west coast of Australia was a much quicker route than around the coast of the Indian Ocean made Dutch landfalls on the west coast inevitable. Most of these landfalls were unplanned. The most famous and bloodiest result was the mutiny and murder that followed the wreck of the Batavia.

=== William Dampier===
'''William Dampier''' first explored the north-west coast of Australia in 1688, in the Cygnet, a small trading vessel. He made another voyage in 1699, before returning to England. The first Englishman to see Australia, he was able to describe some of the flora and fauna of Australia, being the first to report Australia's peculiar large hopping animals.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''reductio ad absurdum'' method can be extended to ''complex sentences''. A complex sentence is a sentence made up of smaller sentences, for example &quot;Sarah can swim but she cannot dive&quot; is made up of the declarative sentences &quot;Sarah can swim&quot; and &quot;She cannot dive&quot;, linked by the conjunction &quot;but&quot;. Such words and phrases that link other declarative sentences are ''sentence functors''. A ''functor'' is the part of a language that stands for a function. For instance &quot;y=sin(x)&quot; is a statement (in a particular mathematical notation) about the function sine and &quot;sin()&quot; is the functor that stands for this function in that statement. Function is not defined here. If you are unsure of its meaning, please refer to Wikipedia.

A 'sentence function' takes declarative sentences as input and yields declarative sentences as output. Sentence functors stand for such functions. A sentence functor is then a '''string of words and sentence variables that becomes a declarative sentence if each sentence variable is replaced by a declarative sentence''' (here &quot;string&quot; just means a series of symbols). This is true for English, French, Spanish, German, Greek, Latin and so on, but all words and declarative sentences must be in the same language.

==The composition of sentences==

Sentences comprise parts known as ''constituents''. A constituent will be defined as '''a string of symbols that is meaningful by itself'''. This definition may be regarded as slightly empty and the meaning of constituent is probably best understood intuitively and by example. The following are constituents of the sentence &quot;The cat sat on the mat&quot;:

''the''

''cat''

''the cat''

''sat on the mat''

''on the mat''

''the cat sat on the mat''

All of the above are meaningful in themselves. Words are meaningful by themselves and so all individual words are constituents of any sentence that contains them (words can be considered ''atomic'' parts of language, that is they cannot be broken down further into other constituents - inflections, prefixes and suffixes are ignored here). The meaning of each constituent shown is the same as its meaning as a part of the sentence. The meaning of the constituent must be the same as it meaning in the sentence of which it is part, otherwise (although a string identical to the constituent may appear in the sentence) it is not a constituent of the sentence. For example, consider the sentence &quot;the man who wrote on the blackboard was old&quot;. 

The string &quot;the blackboard was old&quot; is meaningful, however its meaning is no part of the sentence above, which is asserting that the man, not the blackboard, was old. Hence, &quot;the blackboard was old&quot; is not a constituent of that sentence. Similarly, and perhaps less clearly, &quot;the man&quot; is not a constituent of the sentence. The meaning of &quot;the man&quot; is not the meaning conveyed in the sentence. Were &quot;the man&quot; to be a constituent, it would suggest that a particular man had already been identified. However, this is not the case since the restriction &quot;who wrote on the blackboard&quot; is needed. So, &quot;the man&quot; is not a constituent, but &quot;the man who wrote on the blackboard&quot; is.

==Ambiguity==

An ambiguous sentence is one that has more than one meaning. Crudely speaking, there are two types of ambiguity: structural and lexical. A lexical ambiguity arises where one word (or perhaps a phrase) has more than one meaning; for example &quot;fast&quot; in the sentences &quot;He drove very fast&quot; and &quot;He was fast asleep&quot;. A structural ambiguity arises in a constituent because it is unclear what that constituent's constituents are. To clarify this, the notion of ''scope'' is introduced.

The ''scope'' of a constituent is defined as '''the smallest constituent containing that constituent and something else besides'''. So, in the above example, the scope of &quot;blackboard&quot; is &quot;the blackboard&quot;; the scope of the first &quot;the&quot; is &quot;the man who wrote on the blackboard&quot;.

Consider the sentence &quot;He told me to be careful this evening&quot;. Was this warning discussed in this sentence issued this evening or was it about this evening? It is unclear exactly what the constituents of this sentence are: it is unclear what the scope of &quot;this evening&quot; is. Is the scope of &quot;this evening&quot; &quot;to be careful this evening&quot;, or is it the whole sentence &quot;He told me to be careful this evening&quot;? It can be seen that a new language might be devised to clear up such ambiguities: &quot;He told me [to be careful this evening]&quot;; &quot;[He told me to be careful this evening]&quot;. Propositional calculus is an entirely unambiguous language, using a bracketing system as shown here. This will be seen in the next part of the book.

==Sentence functors==

To repeat the definition given earlier, sentence functors are '''strings of words and sentence variables such that if all the sentence variables are replaced by any declarative sentences, the whole becomes a declarative sentence'''. To fully understand this definition, it is necessary to know what a ''sentence variable'' is. A sentence variable is something (usually represented by the Greek letters psi, phi or chi) that can be assigned as its value any declarative sentence.

One example of a sentence functor was discussed in the section on consistency: ''it is not the case that phi''

Other examples of a sentence functors are:

''phi and psi''
''I know that phi''
''It is obvious that phi''
''Either phi, or psi and chi''

The following are not English sentence functors (consider whether the string obtained by replacing the sentence variable with a declarative sentence is in itself a declarative sentence):

''Mary and phi''
''Is it true that phi?''
''phi is true''		(but ''&quot;phi&quot; is true'' is a sentence functor)
''Whomever phi should stand up for themselves''

The last example forms a declarative sentence when phi is replaced by some declarative sentences (for example, if replaced with &quot;Jack is bullying&quot;), but not all (e.g. &quot;the sky is blue&quot;), so it is not a sentence functor.

The ''number of places'' of a sentence functor is the number of different sentence variables it contains.

''Either phi, or psi and chi'' is a 3-place sentence functor.
''Either phi or psi''  is a 2-place sentence functor.
''Either it is the case that psi or it is not the case that psi''  is a 1-place sentence functor.

An n-place sentence functor is ''satisfied'' by certain ''ordered n-tuplets'' of declarative sentences. An ordered n-tuplet of declarative sentences is a list of n different declarative sentences in a particular order. In particular, those ordered n-tuplets of declarative sentences that satisfy an n-place sentence functor yield a ''true'' declarative sentence when they, in order, replace the sentence variables of a sentence functor.

The ordered pair (grass is green, snow is black) satisfies ''it is the case that phi, but not that psi''; whereas the ordered pair (snow is black, grass is green) does not.

A sentence is a sentence functor with no sentence variables, i.e. a sentence is a 0-place sentence functor.

==Truth tables==

When determining what sentences satisfy what sentence functors, the logician is interested in their truth value (rather than the actual meaning or sense). This information can be summarised in the form of a ''truth table''.

A truth table stipulates all combinations of truth for a given set of sentences and what the truth value of a sentence functor is for each combination.

Consider the sentence functor ''phi and psi''. The truth table for this sentence functor is drawn up as follows:



{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! P
! Q
! P and Q
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || F || F
|-
| F || T || F
|-
| F || F || F
|}

Notice that the letters P and Q are used rather than phi and psi. Sentence variables cannot bear truth values. P and Q instantiate actual sentences, the truth values of which are considered below these letters in the table: 'T' stands for when that sentence is true and 'F' stands for when it is false. Note also that &quot;P and Q&quot; is a sentence, not a 2-place sentence functor (sentence functors with at least one sentence variable cannot bear truth values). To know what the value of the declarative sentence yielded by replacing the sentence variables of the sentence functor with sentences of various truth values, the row (known as a ''structure'') containing the desired truth values is selected and the letter in that row below the complex sentence taken.

In the above example, the sentence &quot;P and Q&quot; is true when P is true and Q is true but false for any other values of P and Q (so when P is true but Q is false, &quot;P and Q&quot; is false).

Consider the truth table of the sentence functor ''Hume knew that phi''.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! P
! Hume knew that P
|-
| T || -
|-
| F || F
|}



The structure where P is false is false for &quot;Hume knew that P&quot;, for it is not possible to ''know'' something that is false. However, the structure where P is true has the symbol &quot;-&quot; in it (this will be referred to as a blank). '''This symbol does not mean that the sentence is neither true nor false in this structure'''. It means that there are true sentences that satisfy this functor and there are sentences that do not satisfy this functor. For example, Hume knew that his (Hume's) first name was David. However, he did not know that Russell was (or rather would be from Hume's perspective) a 20th century philosopher.

[[w:Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] comes preinstalled on [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] and many [[w:Linux|Linux]] distributions. In addition, it is available for most other [[w:operating system|operating systems]], including [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]].

To find the easiest way to install Ruby for your system, follow the directions below. You can also install Ruby by compiling the source code, which can be downloaded from the [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby web site].

== Operating systems ==

=== Mac OS X ===

Ruby comes preinstalled on Mac OS X. To check what version is on your system:

# Launch the [[w:Terminal (application)|Terminal]] application, which is located in the &quot;Utilities&quot; folder, under &quot;Applications&quot;.
# At the command-line, enter: &lt;code&gt;ruby -v&lt;/code&gt;

If you want to install a more recent version of Ruby, you can:

* Buy the latest version of Mac OS X, which may have a more recent version of Ruby.
* Install Ruby using [[w:RVM|RVM]]. (This is the most popular way because you can manage ruby versions and install many other ruby packages)
* Install Ruby using [[w:Fink|Fink]].
* Install Ruby using [[w:MacPorts|MacPorts]].
* Install Ruby using [[w:Homebrew_(package_management_software)|Homebrew]].

=== Linux ===

Ruby comes preinstalled on many Linux systems. To check if Ruby is installed on your system, from the shell run: &lt;code&gt;ruby -v&lt;/code&gt;

If ruby is not installed, or if you want to upgrade to the latest version, you can usually install Ruby from your distribution's software repository. Directions for some distributions are described below.

==== Debian / Ubuntu====

On [[w:Debian|Debian]] and [[w:Ubuntu (Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]], install Ruby using either the graphical tool [[w:Synaptic Package Manager|Synaptic]] (on Debian, only if it is installed; it is included with Ubuntu) or the command-line tool [[w:Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]].

==== Fedora Core ====

If you have [[w:Fedora Core|Fedora Core]] 5 or later, you can install Ruby using the graphical tool Pirut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/yum | title=yum | publisher=Fedora Wiki | accessdate=2006-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, you can install Ruby using the command-line tool [[w:Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]].


==== Arch Linux ====

If you have [[w:Arch Linux|Arch Linux]]  you can install Ruby using the command-line tool [[w:Pacman (package manager)|pacman]].

==== Mandriva Linux ====

On [[w:Mandriva Linux|Mandriva Linux]], install Ruby using the command-line tool [[w:urpmi|urpmi]].

==== PCLinuxOS ====

On [[w:PCLinuxOS | PCLinuxOS]], install Ruby using either the graphical tool Synaptic or the command-line tool apt.

==== Red Hat Linux ====

On [[w:Red Hat Linux|Red Hat Linux]], install Ruby using the command-line tool [[w:RPM Package Manager|RPM]].

=== Windows ===

Ruby does not come preinstalled with any version of [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]]. However, there are several ways to install Ruby on Windows.

* Download and install one of the compiled Ruby binaries from the [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby web site].
* Download and run the one click [http://rubyinstaller.org/ RubyInstaller].
* Install [[w:Cygwin|Cygwin]], a collection of [[w:free software|free software]] tools available for Windows. During the install, make sure that you select the &quot;ruby&quot; package, located in the &quot;Devel, Interpreters&quot; category.

==== Windows is slow ====

Currently Ruby on windows is a bit slow.  Ruby isn't optimized for windows, because most core developers use Linux.  Though 1.9.2 passes almost all core tests on windows.

Most of today's slowdown is because when ruby does a &lt;pre&gt;require 'xxx'&lt;/pre&gt; it searches over its entire load path, looking for a file named xxx, or named xxx.rb, or xxx.so or what not.  In windows, doing file stat's like that are expensive, so requires take a longer time in windows than linux.

1.9 further complicates the slowdown problem by introducing gem_prelude, which avoids loading full rubygems (a nice speedup actually), but makes the load path larger, so doing require's on windows now takes forever.  To avoid this in 1.9.2, you can do a &lt;pre&gt;require 'rubygems'&lt;/pre&gt; which reverts to typical load behavior.

If you want to speed it up (including rails) you can use 

http://github.com/rdp/faster_require

Which have some work arounds to make loading faster by caching file locations.

Also the &quot;rubyinstaller&quot; (mingw) builds are faster than the old &quot;one click&quot; installers  If yours comes from rubyinstaller.org, chances are you are good there.

NB that Jruby tends to run [http://betterlogic.com/roger/?p=2841 faster] but start slower, on windows, than its MRI cousins.  Rubinius is currently not yet windows compatible.

== Building from Source ==

If your distro doesn't come with a ruby package or you want to build a specific version of ruby from scratch, please install it by following the directions [http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk/README here].  Download from [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ here].

== Compile options ==

=== Building with debug symbols ===

If you want to install it with debug symbols built in (and are using gcc--so either Linux, cygwin, or mingw).

  ./configure --enable-shared optflags=&quot;-O0&quot; debugflags=&quot;-g3 -ggdb&quot;

=== Optimizations ===

Note that with 1.9 you can pass it &lt;code&gt; --disable-install-doc&lt;/code&gt; to have it build faster.

To set the GC to not run as frequently (which tends to provide a faster experience for larger 
programs, like rdoc and rails), precede your build with
  $ export CCFLAGS=-DGC_MALLOC_LIMIT=80000000
though you might be able to alternately put those in as opt or debug flags, as well.

== Testing Installation ==

The installation can be tested easily.

 $ ruby -v

This should return something like the following:

 ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [i486-linux]

If this shows up, then you have successfully installed Ruby. However, if you get something like the following:

 -bash: ruby: command not found

Then you did not successfully install Ruby.

When learning Ruby, you will often want to experiment with new features by writing short snippets of code. Instead of writing a lot of small text files, you can use &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt;, which is Ruby's interactive mode.

== Running irb ==

Run &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; from your shell prompt.

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; prompt indicates that &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; is waiting for input. If you do not specify &lt;tt&gt;--simple-prompt&lt;/tt&gt;, the &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; prompt will be longer and include the line number. For example:

 $ '''irb'''
 irb(main):001:0&gt;

A simple &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; session might look like this.

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt; '''2+2'''
 =&gt; 4
 &gt;&gt; '''5*5*5'''
 =&gt; 125
 &gt;&gt; '''exit'''

These examples show the user's input in '''bold'''. &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; uses &lt;tt&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to show you the [[w:return value|return value]] of each line of code that you type in. 

=== Cygwin users ===

If you use [[w:Cygwin|Cygwin's]] [[w:Bash|Bash]] [[w:Shell (computing)|shell]] on [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]], but are running the native Windows version of Ruby instead of Cygwin's version of Ruby, read this section.

To run the native version of &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; inside of Cygwin's Bash shell, run &lt;tt&gt;irb.bat&lt;/tt&gt;.

By default, Cygwin's Bash shell runs inside of the [[w:Win32 console|Windows console]], and the native Windows version of &lt;tt&gt;irb.bat&lt;/tt&gt; should work fine. However, if you run a Cygwin shell inside of Cygwin's [[w:rxvt|rxvt]] [[w:terminal emulator|terminal emulator]], then &lt;tt&gt;irb.bat&lt;/tt&gt; will not run properly. You must either run your shell (and &lt;tt&gt;irb.bat&lt;/tt&gt;) inside of the Windows console or install and run Cygwin's version of Ruby.

== Understanding irb output ==

&lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; prints out the return value of each line that you enter. In contrast, an actual Ruby program only prints output when you call an output method such as &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt;.

For example:

 $ '''irb --simple-prompt'''
 &gt;&gt; '''x=3'''
 =&gt; 3
 &gt;&gt; '''y=x*2'''
 =&gt; 6
 &gt;&gt; '''z=y/6'''
 =&gt; 1
 &gt;&gt; '''x'''
 =&gt; 3
 &gt;&gt; '''exit'''

Helpfully, &lt;code&gt;x=3&lt;/code&gt; not only does an assignment, but also returns the value assigned to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;tt&gt;irb&lt;/tt&gt; then prints out. However, this equivalent Ruby program prints nothing out. The variables get set, but the values are never printed out.

 x=3
 y=x*2
 z=y/6
 x

If you want to print out the value of a variable in a Ruby program, use the &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; method.

 x=3
 puts x</text>

Hi Yath thanks for making the BIG images on [[Tmxxine]] into thumbnails :-)
Can you do anything about [[ASQ]]? [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 06:02, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:You're welcome! By the way, Wikipedia has some good pages on images: [[w:Wikipedia:Extended image syntax]] and [[w:Wikipedia:Picture tutorial]]. --[[User:Yath|Yath]] 15:38, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Yath. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Yath~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Authors should maintain the regular wikibook rules governing unbiased writing, the only other guideline are that everything should be kept more or less in chronological order and divided into logical chapters. Everything else is left pretty much up to the individual authors that elect to join into the project. There are some excellent examples of Wikibooks covering history, including [[Canadian History]], and the Australian History Wikibook is modeled on these. 

The eventual aim of this project is to create a textbook which could, in printed form or online, be a useful resource for high school and university students studying Australian history, and could even be used (in printed form) as the main textbook for a high school or university subject. For more details on this, please see [[Wikibooks:Textbook_Standards#Standards_in_Australia|Textbook Standards in Australia]]. More specific details for creating a Victorian textbook are available [http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/history/aushistory/aushistoryindex.html from the VCAA], including the [http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/history/history-sd.pdf Study design guide].

As of the time of writing, some of the VCE &quot;Australian History&quot; course requirements were as follows:
* Unit 1 covers &quot;Twentieth Century History&quot; (1900-1945)
** Area of Study 1 covers Crisis and Conflict from 1900-1945
*** Outcome 1 calls on students to analyse the crises and conflicts in this period
** Area of Study 2 covers changes to &quot;Social life&quot; in the first half of the twentieth century, in relation to social and economic changes caused by events like the Depression, and the World Wars
*** Outcome 2 calls on students to analyse and discuss these changes
** Area of Study 3 covers &quot;Cultural Expression&quot; in the first half of the Twentieth Century, and its relation to cultural, political, and economic changes in this period
*** Outcome 3 calls on students to analyse the links between cultural expression, and cultural, political, and economic changes in this period

* Unit 2 covers &quot;Twentieth Century History&quot; (1945-2000)
** Area of Study 1 covers the Cold War ideas and political power
*** Outcome 1 calls on students to analyse how Cold War societies legitimised their worldviews
** Area of Study 2 covers &quot;social movements&quot; which emerged during the cold war (e.g. feminism, gay and lesbian rights, etc.)
*** Outcome 2 calls on students to evaluate the impact of these challenges
** Area of Study 3 covers &quot;Issues for the new millenium&quot;
*** Outcome 3 calls on students to analyse political, economic, or technological challenges being faced in the new millennium.

* Unit 3 covers &quot;Australian History&quot;
** Area of Study 1 covers &quot;The Port Phillip District&quot; (1830-1860)
*** Outcome 1 covers the motives and hopes of settlers, and the impact on Indigenous Australians 
** Area of Study 2 covers &quot;Nationalism, Race and Citizenship&quot; (1888-1914)
*** Outcome 2 is an analysis of the ideas behind the new nation and their implementation

* Unit 4 covers &quot;Australian History&quot;
** Area of Study 1 covers &quot;Testing the new nation&quot; (1914-1950)
*** Outcome 1 requires students to analyse how Australians reacted to a crisis in this period
** Area of Study 2 covers &quot;Debating Australia's Future&quot; (1960-2000)
*** Outcome 2 requires students to examine Australian attitudes to either:
**** The Environment
**** Vietnam War
**** Indigenous Rights
**** Immigration

These instructions will make a sticky and indulgent lemon meringue pie. If you want the normal gel-like centre, use the [[Cookbook:Lemon Meringue Pie|other recipe]] instead. 

==Ingredients==
Serves 4.

*8 digestive biscuits (plain/tea biscuits)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|imperial tbsp]] (36 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], 2.4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|US tbsp.]]) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*1 tin (300mL) [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|sweetened condensed milk]]
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], zest and juice
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (1 yolk, 3 whites)
*6 imperial tbsp (108 mL, 7.2 US tbsp.) [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|caster sugar]]

==Procedure==

# Find a 10 inch (25cm) diameter pie dish about 1 inch deep (2.5cm). There are 3 layers to make.
# Make the bottom layer by pounding the digestive biscuits into crumbs with the end of a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]]. Add sufficient melted butter to make the mixture cohere, mix well, then smooth it into the bottom of the pie dish. Press down firmly with the tip of a spoon to make the base. 
# Make the filling. Take a tin of sweetened condensed milk, and add the yolk of one egg. Stir gently, and add the lemon. Add the lemon to taste: more will be better, but be careful not to add too much or it will spoil the texture. Do not stir too much. Pour this into the pie dish, covering the biscuit layer.
# Make the top. Whisk all 3 egg whites, then add the caster sugar, then whisk some more. Spoon the meringue mix into the pie dish, sealing around the edges. 
# Cook the result in a moderately cool oven (325 degrees F) for about 45 minutes until the meringue is a light golden brown. The aim is to cook the meringue and partly cook the centre (unlike, say, Baked Alaska, where only the top of the meringue is flash-cooked). Remove from the oven, allow to cool, and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours to set. Enjoy.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*There are 2 types of lemon meringue pie. The more common version has a lemon &quot;gel&quot; in the centre (which is often a luminous yellow colour), and a hard pastry base.  The version above is much stickier. 
*In an earlier version, the centre used all 3 egg yolks. It isn't necessary, and it is more healthful to omit 2 of them.
*When making the middle, it's essential to mix in the egg before the lemon. The acidity of the lemon acts on the yolk protein to thicken it; putting in the lemon first (which is tempting if you want to &quot;add lemon to taste&quot; without eating raw egg yolk) will cause the yolk to go &quot;stringy&quot; on contact.

:Figure 1: The circuits showing the linearity of resistors.


Most basic electronic circuits are composed of linear elements.  Linear elements are circuit elements which follow Ohm’s Law.  In Figure 1 (a) with independent voltage source, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and resistor, R, a current ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; flows.  The current ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has a value according to Ohm’s Law.  Similarly in Figure 1 (b) with independent voltage source, V2, and resistor, R, a current ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flows.  In Figure 1 (c) with independent voltage sources, V1 and V2, and resistor, R, a current i flows.  Using Ohm’s Law equation 1 is reached.  If some simple algebra is used then equation 2 is reached.  But V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R has a value ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the other term is ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; this gives equation 3. This is basically what the Superposition Theorem states.  


:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac {V_1+V_2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;(1)
:&lt;math&gt;i=\frac {V_1}{R} + \frac {V_2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;(2)
:&lt;math&gt;i=i_1+i_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;(3)


The '''Superposition Theorem''' states that the effect of all the sources with corresponding stimuli on a circuit of linear elements is equal to the algebraic sum of each individual effect.  Each individual effect is calculated by removing all other stimuli by replacing voltage sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits.  Dependent sources can be removed as long as the controlling stimuli is not set to zero.  The process of calculating each effect with one stimulus connected at a time is continued until all the effects are calculated.  If kth stimulus is denoted sk and the effect created by sk denoted ek.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^N e_k&lt;/math&gt;(4)

The steps for using superposition are as follows:
:1. Calculate the effect of each source in turn with all other independent voltage sources short circuited and independent current sources open circuited.
:2. Sum these effects to get the complete effect.

Note: the removal of each source is often stated differently as: replace each voltage source with its internal resistance and each current with its internal resistance.  This is identical to what has been stated above.  This is because a real voltage source consists of an independent voltage source in series with its internal resistance and a real current source consists of an independent current source in parallel with its internal resistance.

===Superposition Example===

[[Image:Superposition_Example.svg]]
:Figure 2: The circuit for the example.


Problem: Calculate the voltage, ''v'', across resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Step 1:
Short circuit V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and solve for v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  By voltage divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;v_{1}= \frac {V_1(R_1 | | R_3)}{R_2+(R_1 | | R_3)}&lt;/math&gt;(5)
Short circuit V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and solve for v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  By voltage divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;v_{2}= \frac {V_2(R_1 | | R_2)}{R_3+(R_1 | | R_2)}&lt;/math&gt;(6)

Step 2:
Sum the effects.
:&lt;math&gt;v=v_1+v_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Using equations 5 and 6.
:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac {V_1(R_1 | | R_3)}{R_2+(R_1 | | R_3)}+\frac {V_2(R_1 | | R_2)}{R_3+(R_1 | | R_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;R_1=R_2=R_3=2k \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_1=V_2=15V&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac {15(2k | | 2k)}{2k+(2k | | 2k)}+\frac {15(2k | | 2k)}{2k+(2k | | 2k)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac {15(1k)}{3k}+\frac {15(1k)}{3k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v=10V \,&lt;/math&gt;

We have launched a project o open source project modelling.

There are a myraid of Open Source projects.  While I appreciate your interest in Open Source, please make project announcements on appropriate sites (eg SourceForge and FreshMeat).  The context of this page is the notion of &quot;Open Source&quot; and the respective liscenses -- NOT a trove of Open Source software.

Moreover, if you actually bothered to read the page, you would note that the context is (incorrectly) NOT Open Source, but rather Freeware.

== a definitve resource ==

I feel it is quite resonable to provide as part of Wikiversity a definitive (and updated) unbiased list of resouces for study [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 15:34, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:While I agree with the spirit of your statement, I disagree with its applicability.  There are several established troves of freeware (and open source) software, notably [http://www.download.com C|Net's Download.com], [http://sourceforge.org SourceForge], and [http://freshmeat.net FreshMeat].  If this page is to be a definitive listing, it would have to address the myriad of individual titles available -- essentially mirroring other established troves.

:I do not believe this to be in the interest of this wiki.

:HOWEVER, I would not object to a listing of the leading applications for each category -- and ONLY the leading application.  Anything beyond that would constitute a trove and thus be subject to the discussion above.

:--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 04:51, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Sometimes there are several leading packages which suit choice, circumstance and preference

The source links you suggest are not suitable for beginners and others who would find the layout confusing

The page is not designed as a trove but as an impartial source that does not have a commercial, open source or other agenda to promote 
to the detriment of end users.

Though open source is the ideal it does not always have the best available software - therefore creating a page that combines the ideas of Open Source with what is of most use, is an educational stance in the spirit of wiki books and not some pedantic insistence on the absolute. 

I hope you have taken the time to add your links to the links section?

[[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 05:10, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Why a simple software listing? ==
Why does it seem to be the standing assumption that a book about Open Source software should be about what software is out there?  I would agree with those that have commented above that we have more then enough of those in the world already, and how would that be a book anyway?  There is a great deal of philosophy in the open source movement, and a great deal to be written about open source project management. To me a ''BOOK'' on open source should cover those issues.  Only after those issues were discussed would a specific listing of software be included.  While these issues can be hinted at in the wikipedia article, to keep to the reasonable length requirements of the pedia it makes sense that detailed discussions about the philosophy, history, debates, lessons learned, case studies and other related discussions would be the topic of a full length book (indeed there are books like that in print).  Where else should a detailed discussion of the difference between the GPL and BSD licences find a proper home?  Or an explination of the difference between free software and open source software?
[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 05:55, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Hi Ahc and everyone - I hope you will take '''the fat''' from the freeware page and wikipedia and place it here where some of the important issues - such as the politics, the future, relationships between groups, legal standing and other up to date sections such as OS NEWS can be explored -

 also the removal indication -which some people with a monitor fixation are too keen on - whilst those with real personality are modifying and adapting NEEDS TO BE CLEARED
or the page should go - if this indication appears I tend to abandon the page as the useless 'experts' rarely attempt to improve or advise they just criticise and remove - yuk. Fortunately some of the more experienced, genuine moderators are more understanding of how sometimes these things take time to develop . . . Good luck I hope you manage to make something of this [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 05:46, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Okay, I'm starting the process of giving this book better direction.  Over the next couple days I'm going to be rather aggressive in pruning, and re-outlining the old material in the book, and starting to create new material.  If anyone had ideas I'd love to hear them.  I expect to copy/move some material from the freeware book and wikipedia articles as appropreite (at least in my opintion). --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 04:47, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I'm trying to figure out how to do this section.  I have two questions that I'm not sure about.

# Should the section include the text of the licenses?
# If so, what are the rules about posting them?  Most (all?) are copyrighted texts, but the authors request that they be shared.  What are wikibook's rules about this, does anyone know?

--[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 05:31, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I would suggest highlights and links to the full text
To be honest I feel there two many liscences and they are confusing

so some form of line from no restrictions to open but restrictions would be useful (if indeed it can be delineated in this way)

:Since there are so many licenses out there I was only going to look at a couple of the most popular and therefore important, GPL, BSD, Apache.  They cover most of the important differences between the types.  If others should be included feel free to suggest them.

== What is open source? ==

The recently added material in what is open source concerns me a little.  Some suggestions from the peanut gallary would be helpful here.  The material is from the [http://opensource.org/ OSI] web site which is licenced under the  [http://opensource.org/licenses/osl-2.1.php Open Software Licence] and the [http://opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php Acedemic Free Licence].  OSL requires that all dirivative works are licenced under the OSL, but the AFL has no such requirements.  Since Wikibooks is licenced under the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GNU Free Documentation Licence] it does not meet the requirements of the OSL but it should be okay under AFL.  Anyone know what the write answer is here?  --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 20:08, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)


: Things can be dual licensed, but the GNU's FDL pretty much cannot be added to anything that already had a license with any restrictions that the FDL doesn't itself impose and things licensed under the FDL cannot be relicensed under anything that adds restrictions.

Given that this book discusses both Open Source Software and Free Software, I would suggest changing the title to FOSS or FLOSS (Free and Libre Open Source Software).</text>

'Philosophy truly becomes worthwhile when it changes your life.'  Perhaps there should be a caveat or two here.  Philosophy can open your eyes, and you might not like what you see.  Don't study philosophy, just get a routine job and live a routine life and don't ask questions!  Do you really want to live like Diogenes or Wittgenstein?
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 07:27, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

The topic is &quot;Why study Philosophy?&quot; not &quot;Why not study Philosophy?&quot;  For those who are up to the challenge, a clear, honest appraisal of life and the universe around us is genuinely liberating from the coercion of dominant paradigms, and can lead to freedom from dependencies, destructive habits and mental disarray.  Whether you choose to focus on negative or positive outcomes reflects your personal philosophy, as does your questioning of values and lifestyles.</text>

Hey there is a certain type of apple which isn't kosher figure what it is called please

I think it might be called ______ shiny apple

Also there is a certain of lettuce maybe it was cabbage which contains so many bugs it is impossible to remove the bugs.

Fruit from a tree less than three years old is not permitted. In practice I've never heard of anyone refusing fruit bought in a store.
There are enough symbols to fill a few pages (for example every country has its own set) , but the most widespread is the OU or Orthodox Union symbol. I this this might make an ideal image.
All fruits/vegetables are kosher. Some choose not to eat lettuce and cabbage because of the effort required to ensure the food free of insects. I've never heard of this 'shiny apple'.

Moreover, the title states &quot;Calculus-based&quot;, yet no differentials were used.  Frankly I think this adjective should be removed and the page should include both the integral/differential form as well as the general (algebraic) form.

I removed the &lt;math&gt;m = \rho v&lt;/math&gt;. I agree that this page needs to be reworked, but I do not see how the reference to Special Relativity is inappropriate. The title is &quot;Conservation of Mass&quot; which is &quot;violated&quot; given the right circumstances. As long as it remains as a reference, it is fine in my opinion.

'Moved the entire page under a new heading. There is really no need to mention conservation of mass in this physics textbook (and not at this early (i.e. Part I) stage) (as we don't deal with chemical/nuclear reactions too much), and if anything, conservation of mass would be useful for something analogous to Continuity Equation of EM (or... does it go by the same name in mechanics?), but that's related to fluid mechanics, which probably won't get added until this book is more mature. So, I moved the page under new heading so that there's no orphaned page or a to-be-worked-on page that's left hanging.... [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] 08:38, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I agree with what's been said. The stuff here seems irrelevant. I would suggest some kinematics first, i.e. no mentions of mass, yet. At least, not till we get to Newton and dynamics.

Define displacement, velocity, and acceleration; and then the kinematic equations. That's one good chapter, there. Yeah, I guess I'm a traditionalist.

This introduction to philosophy is written in part in the first person, and that makes it hard for me to know how to jump in and contribute, because it's someone else's &quot;I&quot;.  Has there been some agreement about the mode or style of this textbook, in terms of what voice or person it will be written in?  It's not even that I'm objecting to an introduction to philosphy being written in the first person, but rather that I can't figure out how to be part of a collective or group that is writing in that mode.  In any case, I'd be grateful for any insight you can provide. [[User:Jjshapiro|Jjshapiro]] ([[User talk:Jjshapiro|talk]]) 00:18, 4 July 2008 (UTC)

==Etymology edit==
Hope you don't mind but I edited the section on the origin of the word &quot;philosophy&quot;. I don't know if that was right but I felt that keeping the etymological article short would allow the reader to ease into this vast subject.

== Non-Greek Origins of Philosophy ==

This article should be updated to provide a sourced and balanced view of the Jaeger/Guthrie view of 'Western philosophy starts with Thales' versus the 'The Greeks stood on the shoulders of non-Greek giants' view put forward by scholars such as Kingsley, Christos C Evangeliou and Algis Uzdavinys. As it stands, it is biased in that it does not put forward the views of Classical scholars who acknowledged their debt to other cultures.


The unsigned comment above is valid and the real issue is religion. The Pantheon of deities that Homer describes (excluding local Greek deities) are related to Babylonian deities as well as a whole host of other Eastern deities. Man's first attempt to explain the world he lived in and how he experienced it begins with the old &quot;hey lets worship that big bright object in the sky that gives us warmth&quot; or &quot;that was a great hunt and my wife's really happy about the woolly mammoth steak sandwiches she can make so I will draw a picture of our experiences of the hunt on our cave wall to celebrate&quot; and other such ideas including ancestors, each other, meteorites, eclipses, disease, etc. Also the Greeks themselves framed their experiences accordingly. Plato is not a rational philosopher in the modern agnostic sense and quite often references the pantheon of deities that were worshiped in his time. I don't know the authors mentioned above but any chapter titled &quot;Origins of Philosophy&quot; should start with a brief discussion of religion. Probably this reply is bit late but if no one minds I will try to put something together along those line.

:I think this should be within the context of Pro/Engineer philosophy, inasmuch as it is necessary to understand some Pro/Engineer philosophy in order to use Pro/Engineer properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The red shift==

Spacetime diagram for explaining the gravitational red shift. 

Light emitted at a lower level in a gravitational field has its frequency reduced as it travels to a higher level. This phenomenon is called the gravitational red shift. 

We can see why this happens by using the principle of equivalence. Being in a gravitational field is equivalent to being in an accelerated frame, so knowing how the doppler shift works in such a frame will tell us how it works in a gravitational field. 

We view the process of light emission and absorption from the the unaccelerated or inertial frame, as shown in the figure above. In this reference frame the observer of the light is accelerating to the right, as indicated by the curved red world line, which is equivalent to a gravitational force to the left. 

The light is emitted at point A with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; by a source which is stationary at this instant. At this instant the observer is also stationary in this frame. However, by the time the light gets to the observer, they have a velocity to the right which means that the observer measures a Doppler shifted freqency &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;/math&gt; for the light. Since the observer is moving away from the source, &lt;math&gt;\omega'&lt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, as indicated above.

The relativistic Doppler shift is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\omega'}{\omega} = \sqrt{ \frac{1 - U/c}{1 + U/c}} , &lt;/math&gt;

so we need to compute ''U''/''c''. The line of simultaneity for the observer at point B goes through the origin, and is thus given by line segment OB. The slope of this line is ''U''/''c'', where ''U'' is the velocity of the observer at point B. From the figure we see that this slope is also given by the ratio ''X' /X''. 

Equating these, eliminating ''X'' in favor of ''L'' = &amp;radic;(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''X''&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the actual invariant distance of the observer from the origin, and substituting into the previous equation results in our gravitational red shift formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
\frac{\omega'}{\omega} &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{ \frac{X - X'}{X + X'} } &amp; = &amp;
\sqrt{\frac{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} - X'}{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} + X'} }\\
&amp; =&amp; \frac{(L^2 + X'^2 )^{1/2} - X'}{L} &amp; =&amp; \frac{X-X'}{L}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X''&amp;prime; = 0, then there is no redshift, because the source is collocated with the observer. On the other hand, if the source is located at the origin, so ''X''&amp;prime;=''X'', the Doppler shifted frequency is zero. In addition, the light never gets to the observer, since the world line is asymptotic to the light world line passing through the origin. If the source is at a higher level in the gravitational field than the observer, so that ''X''&amp;prime; &lt; 0, then the frequency is shifted to a higher value, i. e., it becomes a ''blue shift''.

To see how this doppler shift relates to the strength of gravity, ''g'', and the distance ''h'' between the source and the observer, first note that

:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{c^2}{g} \qquad X-X'=L-h &lt;/math&gt;

Making these substitutions gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega'}{\omega} = 1-\frac{gh}{c^2} \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

So the redshift is proportional to gravity.

Since this doppler shift doesn't depend on the type of wave we can conclude that it is actually caused by time dilation, just like the doppler shift due to relative motion.

That is, gravity slows down time.

==Energy and frequency==

In equation 1 ''gh'' is the change in gravitational potential energy so the change in frequency is proportional to change in potential energy, which suggests there might be a connection with energy conservation.

However, since we haven't yet established any connection between frequency and energy, we can't simply apply a energy conservation argument. Instead, we can argue in reverse, finding out what the energy-frequency relationship must be is energy is to be conserved.

Suppose we have two identical systems, both at rest in a uniform gravitational field ''g'' with initial energy ''E'' separated by a vertical distance ''h''.

The system has mass ''E''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, giving it potential energy, so the total energy of the two systems is initially 

:&lt;math&gt;E_i=2E - \frac{gh}{c^2}E &lt;/math&gt;

where the second term is due to the lesser potential energy of the lower system.

The lower system emits a burst of waves, frequency &amp;omega;, energy ''E''(&amp;omega;). When this reaches the upper system the waves have been
red-shifted to frequency &amp;omega;', energy ''E''(&amp;omega;'). This energy is absorbed by the upper system.

The total energy is now

:&lt;math&gt;E_f=E-E(\omega)+E+ E(\omega') - \left(E-E(\omega)\right)\frac{gh}{c^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since we want to preserve energy conservation, these two equations must give the same result. Equating them, we get

:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega') = E(\omega)(1-\frac{gh}{c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this with the doppler shift we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E(\omega')}{E(\omega)} = \frac{\omega'}{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;

which can only be true if ''E''(&amp;omega;) is proportional to &amp;omega;

I.e, energy conservation implies ''energy is proportional to frequency'', which is one of the axioms of quantum theory.

We could equally well have started with the quantum result and proved the gravitational red shift must exist. Either theory requires the other for consistency.

Since energy and frequency are each the temporal components of a four-vector, their being proportional implies the four-vectors themselves, and their spatial components, are also proportional. So, for waves, momentum is proportional to '''k'''.

Remember too, we saw earlier, when we looked at Hamilton's equations, that classical mechanics would be equivalent to a theory of anisotropic waves, in the geometrical optics limit, if energy were proportional to frequency and momentum to wave number. This proportionality isn't just required for energy conservation, it would make possible a theory uniting waves and particles.

None of this actually proves the proportionality, doing that requires experiment, but it does make it a natural assumptiom, which is indeed
confirmed by experiment.

Because of all this, from now on we'll assume that energy and frequency are related in this way, with the constant of proportionality being &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (c\mathbf{p}, E) = \hbar (c\mathbf{k}, \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

==Gravity and curvature==

The gravitational redshift also implies that space is curved. We can see this by considering a rectangle in space-time.

Without gravity, if we start at some point A, wait for time ''t'', then move at light-speed to the right for a distance ''h'', we get to the same place, B, as if we move at light-speed for a distance ''h'' then wait for time ''t'' at rest with respect to A. &lt;!-- diagram? --&gt;

With gravity, if we follow the first path, we rise a distance of ''ct'' then wait for time ''t''. On the second path, we begin by waiting for time ''t'', ''but this is dilated by gravity.'' To an observer at B we appear to be waiting for a time ''t''(1+''gh''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) before we start, so we end up at B later than on the first path. 

Thus, with gravity, it matters which order we add distance vectors in. This can't happen if space is flat, so ''space must be curved.''

To describe how it's curved we'd need the techniques of General Relativity.

hope you do not require dictionary defintions to smile :-) [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 05:56, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) :

  Alchemy \Al&quot;che*my\, n. [OF. alkemie, arquemie, F. alchimie, Ar.
     al-k[=i]m[=i]a, fr. late Gr. ?, for ?, a mingling, infusion,
     ? juice, liquid, especially as extracted from plants, fr. ?
     to pour; for chemistry was originally the art of extracting
     the juices from plants for medicinal purposes. Cf. Sp.
     alquimia, It. alchimia. Gr. ? is prob. akin to L. fundere to
     pour, Goth. guitan, AS. ge['o]tan, to pour, and so to E.
     fuse. See Fuse, and cf. Chemistry.]
     1. An imaginary art which aimed to transmute the baser metals
        into gold, to find the panacea, or universal remedy for
        diseases, etc. It led the way to modern chemistry.
  
     2. A mixed metal composed mainly of brass, formerly used for
        various utensils; hence, a trumpet. [Obs.]
  
              Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy. --Milton.
  
     3. Miraculous power of transmuting something common into
        something precious.
  
              Kissing with golden face the meadows green, Gilding
              pale streams with heavenly alchemy.   --Shak.


From WordNet (r) 2.0 :

  alchemy
       n 1: a pseudoscientific forerunner of chemistry in medieval times
       2: the way two individuals relate to each other; &quot;their
          chemistry was wrong from the beginning -- they hated each
          other&quot;; &quot;a mysterious alchemy brought them together&quot; [syn:
           chemistry, interpersonal chemistry]

----

You will note that all but two definitions (Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) - definition 3;  WordNet (r) 2.0, definition 2) relate solely to metallurgy.  The other two use the term as a literary device in a metaphorical sense.

Please fully cite your sources that contradict these definitions.


Perhaps you would be good enough to find these and add them to the page?

If you are unable to then I must conclude that Alchemy is little more than you suggest

Perhaps anywhere other than reference material might be a start [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 05:56, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)


--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 05:09, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Structure and goals ==

''1. An imaginary art which ... led the way to modern chemistry.''

&lt;nowiki&gt;*snerk*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Interesting how something they claim is imaginary could lead the way to anything.

I was delighted to see there was a book on alchemy, but I do think the structure and organization as suggested in the TOC needs some serious work. I'll see if I have time to think about it this weekend. (That's beyond the header levels, which are messed up right now -- everything under &quot;Relationship to Chemistry and Physics&quot;, for instance. Unfortunately, it's five to midnight and I'll be lucky if I finish this comment coherently, much less trying to fix the headers.)

However, before the structure can be finalized, I think some of the book's basic goals need to be clarified. What is the purpose of this text--what is it intended to teach, and why?  Who are the audience, what do they already know about the topic, and what do they want to learn?  What should they have gained after reading it that they didn't have when they started, and how are they going to use that information?-[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]]

:It is intended to teach what it becomes - I hope that makes some sense. What people gain whether in construction or in reading is dependent on intent. I suppose the question will be answered during the construction.  [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 17:41, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

It seems from your mention of &quot;operative alchemy&quot; that you're aiming for a practical text, but the actual organization of the TOC seems only partly practical, partly theoretical, historical, and cultural. I actually think the latter would work better, if only because there's a much larger audience for an introduction to the ideas of alchemy than for an introduction to the practice of alchemy. Maybe a book focusing more on the practice would be suitable for a followup, if there's enough public domain sources to work with. (I suspect there are... I know I've seen at least a few of the old occult texts at Internet repositories, and it might be interesting to seek out and maybe interview some of the modern practitioners.) -[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]]

:most occultist practice befuddlement - first of themself and then others ;-) However you are more than welcome to structure and arrange in way you like [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 17:41, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Accuracy dispute ==

Eibwen, can you specify exactly what part of the module you are disputing? The few specific paragraphs need some work for citations and NPOV, but overall, there's not a lot there yet to dispute. If you'll point out what you think is inaccurate, I'll know what to start working with first.

If I've read the previous discussion correctly (which I may very well not have -- the formatting makes it difficult to know who's saying what), it sounds like you're disputing the idea that alchemy includes anything other than turning lead into gold. I don't really think that idea needs any citation, since it's pretty basic to the field. Citations for specific elaborations of the idea will be added as the content is written, but for now there's not much here but an outline.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 17:21, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I commiserate that this page is particularly difficult to follow, particularly since [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] interjected commentary into what I wrote, often without organization or appending a signature.  Your assesment however is largely correct.  I concur with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy Wikipedia Entry], however I would prefer to see citations for such claims as &quot;Alchemical relaxation&quot;.  Additionally, the denotations were taken largely out of context.  I grant that this is a work in progress, but in its current form, even its scope itself is a contradiction:

 This is an exercise in operative alchemy. ... Speculative alchemy is what you are reading.

:It is presumed that both are exclusive, yet neither is defined.  Hopefully with further revisions, the page will improve dramatically.

:--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 19:19, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== TOC Reorganization ==

Okay, here's a possible second draft for the structure. I've fixed the header heirarchy, added a few sections, and rearranged a few others. I haven't deleted any, although I think a few of them should be deleted. Proponents and Achievements, for instance, are obviously very important types of information, but I do think they're types of information rather than topics on their own. I'd suggest deleting them as sections and instead incorporating the material into the relevant history or science sections. Newton, for instance, would go under the Western section. I didn't know what you were thinking of doing with Media and Language, so I didn't try putting them anywhere. The &quot;As Above, So Below&quot; concept needs to be included, but I wasn't sure whether to give it a section of its own or to thread it in throughout the History/Significance and Theory sections. Maybe a subsection within Theory?  Except my own feeling is that it's important enough it needs to be introduced sooner. Maybe mentioned in passing in the introduction and/or the relevant history portions, and described fully as a subsection under Theory?--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 23:41, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:All your ideas are fine with me - I like the idea of the planets and suggest adding the twelve types of Man [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 17:43, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::I'll have to leave that to you, as I'm not sure what they are. Unless you mean the Zodiac? I've actually never studied alchemy per se, just picked up bits of it as it overlaps other areas I was studying (although there is quite a bit of overlap). This book will be a good excuse for me to finally start studying it!--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 19:15, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

First of all my apologies for not using my signature properly - still learning. The 12 types of Man (the use of the word Man is similar to the use of Sir to denote seniority when applied to women - and is a referral to a time of greater ignorance regarding the potential of women) So it might be more politically correct to use some other term. Alchemy is not a time or fashion centered study however. If you are interested in developing this part of the book then I suggest splitting the 12 types into the 4 elements. Then think of it is a system of balancing. If you do it in this way a horoscope becomes a quite profound form of psychological profiling (forget the stars for now). [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 01:06, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Excelent re organisation - the work needs to be fleshed out to make 'Adam Kadmon' the primal man come to life [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 08:46, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Appropriate Bookshelf ==

What on earth is this doing in the science section? There's no possible explanation for that.
I personally don't see the utility of this &quot;textbook&quot; at all, but if people want to write it on Wikibooks that's fine &lt;i&gt;as long as it's not in the science section&lt;/i&gt;. And for those who suggest that alchemy being a precedent to chemistry makes it a science, religion and witchcraft and magic etc. played a similar role, but I think you'll agree there should not be a science textbook on religion, witchcraft or magic (if you disagree, you're even more strangely deluded than I thought). --[[User:24.103.207.38|24.103.207.38]] 22:03, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:So, the ptoblem with this matter is the classification in the Science section. It is not, in the frame of modern definition of scientific methodology. But it is an old and comprehensive body of knowledge, a very interesting expression of human colective psyche, as it used to express when mankind was not so tied to matter and to causal thought to had become unable to feel the flow of energy among living beings and other things. 
:Alchemy is a major basis of C.G.Jung's work. See his Psychology and alchemy, Mysterium conjuncionis, etc. Deleting this book is medieval censorship. --[[User:Ligia|Ligia]] 02:32, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)
Alchemical principles are used in wiki creation, scientific method, medicine preparation, architecture, art and gastronomy. It has long engaged at the highest level of human endeavour whilst the unintiated say Gu? - just like when we first showed them metal as superior to flint [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 17:07, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)

For some reason this is under &quot;Chemistry&quot; in the Natural Sciences section of Wikibooks. Surely, we can think of a better category?

: The Alchemy book has been removed from the chemistry bookshelf and placed on the miscellaneous bookshelf. Perhaps if texts on astrology, witchcraft, karma, and the like are written, it can get a more conspicuous position on a such a new-age/mysticism bookshelf. [[User:Zolot|Zolot]]

== Neo Alchemy ==

Alchemy is not a static science and it is borne in fire and flaming - in the furnace. I wish everyone success in cooking up the magic of a book. It may end in flames. It may result in a great future. [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 08:49, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I'm sorry, but this is a pretty general book. There's a fine line between sciences and new age hippies' books.</text>

I am unsure as to the listing of Canola oil as an ingredient.  If it enhances the flavor, fine -- however if it is merely used to prevent the eggs from sticking to the pan, it should be removed from the list.  The ONLY necessary ingredient that I am aware of is the eggs themselves.

Perhaps mention that 4 eggs is a typical serving -- or whatever the case may be.

Changed ingredients to allow for different sizes, seasoning to taste (orig recipe had WAY too much salt, I think it was measure in tablespoons), and different fats.

Re-wrote instuctions, but left others because there is more than one way to do it.  The new instructions are clearer and more thorough.

== Shaped Scrambled Eggs? ==

Does anyone know how to make shaped scrambled eggs? Like what you would get if you were at a restaurant and ordered a sausage egg and cheese biscuit? 

I once bought a ring that was ''supposed'' to this, but it didn't work. So please don't edit this if you're only guessing. I was hoping someone could add more depth to this article by adding different ways scrambled eggs could be made.[[User:Magnoliasouth|MagnoliaSouth]] 12:29, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This may be slightly beyond the scope of the section, but there are additional methods (and probably several others):

echo '&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikibooks.org&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;' . &quot;\n&quot;;

Yet for a PHP page intended for viewing on the internet (as opposed to console PHP scripts), the simplest approach is likely:

?&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikibooks.org&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;?

Granted this precludes the use of variables, but if there aren't any variables to include, why use PHP for its own sake?

Fall of the Byzantines and Rise of the Ottomans

When in 1453, [[Ottoman Empire]] destoyed Constantinople, and renamed it Istanbul, Rome was finally declared crushed. It began to fall in all areas of life, and then fell alltogether. Meanwhile, the most successful Ottoman ghazi came to power(1248-1326?) and began to build the Ottoman Empire. Ostman was a firm believer of Islam, and treated all his captured people with respect, and allowed them to worship whom they wished.

(This should go in one of the Middle east sections)

As time progresses and a language is often used, sounds start to change; different phonemes are used. The words get &quot;smoothed&quot; like gravel at a beach or in a desert. After centuries the stones will be smooth. ''Sound changes'', as they're called, are a major driving force of language change.

Sound changes are born every time we speak. People rarely say any word perfectly; perhaps your &amp;lt;t&amp;gt; was a little too far forward, or your &amp;lt;u&amp;gt; wasn't rounded as much as it normally would be. Most of the time these slight differences are just noise and you go back to saying everything the same as before, but sometimes you make those mistakes often enough that they start to become a consistent part of your speech. Anyone who respects or admires you &amp;mdash; even if it's just your group of friends &amp;mdash; will start to subconsciously copy the way that you speak and that sound change will begin to spread.

Sound change is nigh unstoppable. If you write two novels in the same setting in different periods of time using the same conlang, it's quite likely some sound changes will have happened, so you'll want to implement them.

Sound change also has no memory. If at a certain point in time there are some sounds X in words, they all will change to Y even if some of them were W a few centuries ago while some have been X since the beginning of the language.

Very important is also that sound change is grammatically unrestricted. This means in simpler terms, that a sound change can not only apply to verbs, it has to apply to all words in all inflections. Only phonological constraints are allowed. For example A changes to C if it is followed by B. So in a word there is DAB which changes to DCB, but in another case the word DAE does not change. If a sound change changes one form of a word, the others only follow this change if the rule for this change applies to them too.

In the case that two words would be pronounced the same if a certain sound change happens, one of the following things can happen:

* Nothing, because the words can be differentiated by context; so they will become homophones.

* The words will merge, beginning to mean the same grammatically &amp;mdash; synonyms.

* The word to be changed will refuse to change.

* People will stop using one or the other word, replacing it with another construct.


==Common Sound Changes==

Some kinds of sound changes are more common than others. Let's take a look at the most common ones.

===Assimilation===

Assimilation is by far the most important sound change. Assimilation is when a sound changes to become more similar to the surrounding sounds. A consonant may change to match the place or type of articulation of an adjoining consonant.

* In English, /{{CXS|n}}/ often becomes [{{CXS|F}}] (labiodental) before /{{CXS|f}}/, like in &amp;lt;infant&amp;gt;.

* The word &lt;assimilation&gt; is an example. It comes from adding &amp;lt;ad-&amp;gt; onto &amp;lt;similate&amp;gt;. The /{{CXS|d}}/ assimilates to /{{CXS|s}}/.


===Lenition===

Lenition is the &quot;weakening&quot; of sounds. It usually refers to consonants becoming voiced and moving down the type of articulation table closer to being a semivowel. It also refers to sounds that disappear altogether.  Lenition is especially common intervocalically (between two vowels).

:Examples:
:/{{CXS|t}}/ » [{{CXS|d}}]
:/{{CXS|d}}/ » [{{CXS|s}}]
:/{{CXS|k}}/ » []

* In some varieties of English, /{{CXS|t}}/ and /{{CXS|d}}/ can become [{{CXS|4}}].


===Palatalization===

Palatalization is the shifting of a consonant towards the palate. This is a common type of assimilation. Consonants can palatalize before or after a front vowel ([{{CXS|i}}], [{{CXS|e}}]) or a palatal consonant ([{{CXS|j}}]), perhaps ending up as an affricate or fricative.

:Examples:
:/{{CXS|tj}}/ » [{{CXS|tS}}]
:/{{CXS|dj}}/ » [{{CXS|dZ}}]
:/{{CXS|sj}}/ » [{{CXS|S}}]
:/{{CXS|zj}}/ » [{{CXS|Z}}]
:/{{CXS|hj}}/ » [{{CXS|C}}]

* In English, pronunciation of the ''-tion'' suffix as /{{CXS|S@n}}/ is the result of palatalization of a former /{{CXS|si@n}}/.

* In Japanese, the pronunciation of &lt;si&gt; as /{{CXS|s\i}}/, &lt;ti&gt; as /{{CXS|t's\i}}/, &lt;di&gt; as /{{CXS|dZi}}/, and &lt;hi&gt; as /{{CXS|Ci}}/ is the result of palatalization.


===Velarization===

Velarization is a secondary articulation of a consonant where the back of the tongue is raised towards the velum. In some languages, such as Russian and Irish, velarized consonants often contrast with palatalized consonants.

* In some varieties of English, when /{{CXS|l}}/ is found in the syllable coda position, it is velarized (e.g. &lt;wall&gt; as /{{CXS|wO:l_G}}/).  When /{{CXS|l}}/ is found in the syllable onset position it is non-velaried (e.g. &lt;lawn&gt; as /{{CXS|lO:n}}/).


===Monophthongization===

Monophthongization is the simplification of a diphthong (or triphthong) down to a single vowel. This feature was very common in Old French and Ancient Greek, leading some the diphthongs of these languages to be monophthongized. For instance, the French &amp;lt;ai&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;eau&amp;gt; are now pronounced [{{CXS|E}}] and [{{CXS|o}}]; in Modern Greek, the combinations &amp;lt;ει&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;οι&amp;gt; are pronounced [{{CXS|i}}].

* In Australian English, the diphthong /{{CXS|e@}}/ (as in &amp;lt;air&amp;gt;) is often pronounced [{{CXS|e:}}].

* In some American English dialects, the diphthong /{{CXS|aI}}/ (as in &amp;lt;eye&amp;gt;) is pronounced [{{CXS|a:}}].


===Nasalization===

Vowels next to nasal consonants very often become nasal themselves. This is a type of assimilation. If a nasal consonant disappears, the mark it left on the vowel may remain, causing nasal vowels to become phonemic.

* Again, this is a feature very common in the French language. Consider the word &amp;lt;maison&amp;gt;, ''house'' pronounced [{{CXS|mE&quot;zO_~}}]. The &amp;lt;o&amp;gt; was nasalised because a nasal sound (namely /{{CXS|n}}/) was following.

===Rhotacism===

This is the change from /{{CXS|z}}/ to a trilled /{{CXS|r}}/, which has occurred in various European languages. In Latin, /{{CXS|s}}/ became /{{CXS|z}}/ between vowels (lenition), and /{{CXS|z}}/ then proceeded to become /{{CXS|r}}/. This causes alternations between /{{CXS|s}}/ and /{{CXS|r}}/ in some words' inflected forms: Flower is ''flos'' in the nominative singular, but ''floris'' in the genitive.

You can regularise these sounds over time. Latin did this, so that original ''flos'' and ''honos'' became ''flor'' and ''honor'', to match their genitives ''floris'' and ''honoris''.

== Environments ==

{{todo|
explain particular environments and how they affect and restrict sound changes.
include explanation of the X -&gt; Y / Z notation.
}}


== Choosing sound changes ==

The basic idea here is that when you're making your conlang you should have in your mind a parent language (or proto-language) and a child language. The proto-language is going to be a conlang just as we have been making up until this point and should not have any history to it.  The child language is going to contain all the history. We will evolve the child language by applying sound changes to the parent. The child language is the ''result''; the language that you will present to other people, or put in your novel, or whatever other reason you conlang for.

Before you begin, you may want to have some idea of the kinds of sounds that you want your child language to have. Create a rough draft of the phonology of the child language. Once you have that, you can start trying to change the phonology of the proto-language into this child draft by selecting sound changes and adding them to a list. It takes some practice to be able to do this well, so don't worry too much if the final product isn't exactly the same as your draft.

Alternatively, you can decide not to worry too much about the final product and simply select sound changes randomly. You won't have much control over what you get, but you may get something interesting.

Once you have a list of sound changes, you will want to go through the dictionary of the proto-language an apply those sound changes to every word there.

{{todo|go through a simple example}}

== Sound change appliers ==

You may have noticed that applying sound changes to words is quite a tedious process. To help with this, some conlangers have written computer programs called ''Sound change appliers'' that automate much of this work for you.

The original and most famous sound change applier is the [http://zompist.com/sounds.htm SCA] by Zompist.

Sound change appliers are powerful and useful tools, but they can have trouble with certain kinds of changes. They can get confused by any change that needs to happen in particular syllables, such as syllable-based syncope, or any change where the environment spans multiple syllables, such as umlaut.

==Numbers in Prolog==
Prolog, like any other programming language, has a representation for numbers. Numbers are used like constants, and represented like they are anywhere on the computer, the following are valid ways of dealing with numbers in a predicate:

 a(12, 345).
 a(A) :- b(A, 234.3).
 a(345.3409857) :- b(23476.923804).

To perform mathematical operations on numbers, we will need functions. To store the result of a mathematical operation in a variable, we will need to look more closely at equality.

==Functions==
Until now, predicates have always represented a simple true or false. Predicate a(A, B) is true or false, depending on the values of A and B. Functions are predicates that represent a value. The sin() predicate, for instance, is a function. sin(0) represents the value 0 and sin(1) represents the value 0.841471. Functions can be used anywhere a number or constant can be used, in queries, predicates and rules.
For instance, if the fact '''p(0).''' is in your program, the query '''?- p(sin(0)).''' will unify with it.

The following common mathematical functions are built in to most Prolog implementations:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! function
! example
! result
|-
| + ||  2 + 3 ||  5
|-
| - ||  4 - 1 ||  3
|-
| * ||  4 * 3 ||  12
|-
| / ||  22/7 ||  3.14286 
|-
| ^ ||  4 ^ 2 ||  16
|-
| sin ||  sin(3)
&lt;td&gt; 0.14112 
|}
(table to be completed)

Note that functions themselves cannot be evaluated. the query '''?- sin(3). ''' will fail because sin() is implemented as function and not as a predicate.

One difference between functions and predicates is that the meaning  (or definition) of a predicate is usually defined by you, in your program. When you use functions like '''sin()''', they've already been defined in your prolog implementation. In other words, prolog will not find the definition in your program, but in it's library of ''built-in'' predicates. It is possible to create your own functions, but that's something you will usually not need.

==Equality==

There are several kinds of equality, with slightly different meanings. Here we will just look at the ''='' operator and the ''is'' operator. First, look at:

 ?- A is 22/7.

This query assigns the result of mathematical operation 22/7 to the variable A. So Prolog will answer:

 A = 3.14286

This idea may be familiar from other programming languages. The '''=''' operator, however, is very different. It doesn't solve the right-hand side, but instead keeps it as a formula. So you get this:

 ?- A = 22/7.
 A = 22/7

Instead of assigning the result of the operation to the variable A, prolog assigns the operation to A, without evaluating it.

You can see the same thing with queries. If you ask

 ?- (1 is (2-1)).

You'll get &quot;Yes&quot;, because the (2-1) is evaluated (solved). But if you ask

 ?- (1 = (2-1)).

You'll get &quot;No&quot;, because Prolog will compare a number (1) to a formula (2-1), rather than to the result of solving the formula.

The '''is''' operator is meant specifically for mathematical functions. The left argument has to be a variable and the right argument has to be a mathematical function with all variables instantiated. The  '''=''' operator is used for unification of variables and can be used with any two arguments (although it will fail if the two arguments aren't the same and can't be made the same by instantiating variables a certain way).

Prolog knows many other ways of comparing two terms or instantiating variables, but for now, these two will suffice. When working with functions, we will almost always use the '''is''' operator.

==Math==

Now that we know about functions and equality, we can start programming with math.

 plus(A, B, C) :- C is A + B.

This predicate adds two numbers (A and B), and unifies the result with C. The following program is somewhat more complex.

 fac(0,1).
 fac(A,B) :- 
       A &gt; 0, 
       Ax is A - 1,
       fac(Ax,Bx), 
       B is A * Bx.

This program calculates the factorial of A (A! in math notation). 

It works recursively. The first rule states that the factorial of 0 is 1. The second states that the factorial of a number A greater than 0 is the factorial of A-1 times A.

==Examples==

==Exercises==

(1) What will prolog answer to the following queries (on an empty database)? Try to think of the answer yourself, and then use a prolog compiler to verify it.
* ?- X = 1 + 2 + 3.
* ?- X is 100/10.
* ?- X is (14 + 16)/3, X + 3 = Y.
* ?- X = 1000/100 + 5, Y is X.

(2) Write a predicate called sigma, such that sigma(A,B,N) is true when N=A+(A+1)+(A+2)+...+(B-2)+(B-1)+B. In other words, 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=A}^B i = N&lt;/math&gt;. You may assume that A and B are integers with B&gt;A. Test your predicate with queries such as:

 ?- sigma(4,9,X).
 X = 39 ;
 fail.
 
 ?- sigma(-7,-2,X).
 X = -27 ;
 fail. 
 
 ?- sigma(-5,5,X).
 X = 0 ;
 fail.

(3) The factorial program shown at the end of this chapter sins against one of the [[../Recursive Rules|guidelines]] of using recursive rules. In the second rule:

 fac(A,B) :- 
       A &gt; 0, 
       Ax is A - 1,
       fac(Ax,Bx), 
       B is A * Bx.

The recursive part is not the last predicate in the rule. 

* Show how prolog evaluates the query '''?- fac(3, X).''' and explain why the program is set up like this.
* Explain why the line '''A &gt; 0''' is necessary. What would prolog do after it had found an answer, if the line was missing?

==Answers to Exercises==

(2) As usual, there is more than one way to solve this problem. Here's one way which uses recursion in a similar way to the factorial predicate.

 sigma(A,A,A).
 sigma(A,B,N) :-
 	B&gt;A, %What do you think would happen if you removed this line? Try it. Why does this happen?
 	A1 is A+1,
 	sigma(A1,B,N1),
 	N is A+N1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Michael Porter, one of the leading researchers in the field of business and a professor at [[w:Harvard Business School|Harvard Business School]], has identified five key forces which affect the strategy of any industry. These forces are:
#Threat of New Entrants
#Threat of Substitutes
#Industry Competition
#Bargaining Power of Suppliers
#Bargaining Power of Buyers  

Managers use the Five Forces model to help identify opportunities or evaluate decisions in the context of the environment.  Often, the Five Forces are mapped against a [[w:SWOT analysis|SWOT analysis]] to develop a corporate strategy.

To complete a Five Forces analysis, it is often best to build a grid on a piece of paper and label each section--keeping Industry Competition separate.  Fill-in each section and to develop a view of the industry.  Then, think about if the industry is truly competitive or if the industry is a [[w:monopoly|monopoly]] or [[w:oligopoly|oligopoly]].  What makes your company able to compete in this environment?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Organic isocyanates have the formula 
R-N=C=O where R can be either alkyl or aryl. They can be solids or liquids. Isocyanates are generally toxic and must be handled with great care, especially the more volatile isocyanates where inhalation is a primary route of exposure.

Isocyanates are usually produced by reacting an amine with phosgene (COCl2):

R-NH2  + COCl2  --&gt; HCl  +  R-NH-(C=O)Cl --&gt; HCl + R-N=C=O                    


They are very reactive molecules, reacting with nucleophiles such as water, alcohols or amines. The reactions involve attack at the carbon of the isocyanate in a manner similar to that for carboxylic acid derivates such as esters or anhydrides. 

Water reacts with isocyantes to give a carbamic acid. This reaction is catalyzed by tertiary amines. Carbamic acids are unstable and decompose to carbon dioxide and an amine, R-NH2

R-N=C=O  +  H2O  --&gt;  R-NH-(C=O)-OH  --&gt; RNH2  +  CO2


Alcohols react with isocyanates to give carbamates which are also known as urethanes. This reaction is catalyzed by tertiary amines or salts of metals such as tin, iron and mercury.

R-N=C=O  + R'-OH  --&gt;  R-NH-(C=O)-O-R'


Primary and secondary amines react with isocyanates to give substituted ureas.

R-N=C=O  +  R'R&quot;NH  --&gt;  R-NH-(C=O)-NR'R&quot;

R' and R&quot; can be H, alkyl or aryl


Isocyanates themselves to give dimers and trimers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!  I came here looking for an explanation of why the differences are squared when calculating standard deviation.  The text gives the same explanation as many other texts on statistics I've seen: to get rid of the minus signs.  However, if this was the whole story, it would be sufficient to take the absolute value of each difference, and divide by N to get what I think is called &quot;average deviation&quot;.  

So what makes standard deviation better than average deviation?  

Greetings, Simon

:I'm not sure I would say that the standard deviation is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; than the mean deviation.  Most of the equations are based around the standard deviation, and so that is what we use.  This is just a guess, but since the advent of computers it may also have to do with subtraction of nearly equal numbers being inaccurate and the absolute value in general can be non-useful to work with if you are trying to keep a &quot;running estimate&quot; of the deviation estimate.

: For example, with the standard deviation, we only need to calculate the sum, the sum of squares, and the  number of entities to find the variance (and from there, the standard deviation) for any number of values.  This computational method is more accurate on a computer (since it avoids subtraction of nearly equal numbers), and mathematically identical to the &quot;standard method&quot; used.

:With the mean deviation, I don't know of any cute ways of rewriting it to avoid that step, so every time a number is added the mean would have to be recalculated, along with each differential along the way.  Thus, for the list of numbers {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} we only have to store the numbers 55 (the sum of squares), 15 (the sum), and 5 (the number of entries.  If we add the number 6 to the list, we can calculate 91, 21, and 6 without having to go back to the original list of numbers.  This is much simpler than for the mean deviation, where we need to go back and calculate each individual differential ({2, 1, 0, -1, -2} in the first case and {1.5, 0.5, -0.5, -1.5, -2.5} in the second).

: Does that make any sense? --[[User:Llywelyn|Llywelyn]] 04:17, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

The standard deviation is a good estimate of scale when the data are normally distributed. In practice, it is common for data to be non-normal. They can often be transformed to something resembling normality (often, taking logs is a good choice). However, even after transformation it is common that the data will be heavy tailed and subject to outliers.

In these circumstances, the standard deviation is ''not'' &quot;better&quot; than the mean absolute deviation. In fact, it is much less efficient (i.e. its variance is higher). There are, however, even better estimates of scale than the mean absolute deviation. One is the ''mad'' (median absolute deviation).

This issue is used by Huber (1981) as an example that suggests robust methods over classical methods (Huber's book has recently been republished in paperback format and is more affordable than previously). I believe that Tukey also drew attention to the shortcoming of the standard deviation in this respect as far back as 1960s. This [http://www.eso.org/projects/esomidas/doc/user/98NOV/volb/node275.html article on robust statistics] might be of interest.

P. J. Huber, ''Robust Statistics'', Wiley, '''1981'''
::Hey that's interesting to hear, because I just posted a comment on the article saying that the &quot;get rid of minus&quot; argument is tosh - just that I had assumed there would be sound reasonings otherwise. I'm writing a statistics test soon, and so I'm sure I'll be using the conventional method there, but may look into this later on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General ==

'''Personal pronouns''' are short words that replace persons or things: he, she, they, it, me, her etc.

Personal pronouns can play various roles. For instance, in the sentence ''I eat cake'', the word 'I' is a subject, but in the sentence ''That lion wants to eat me'', the word 'me' is the object.

Other pronouns (not personal) also replace nouns, with a more specific usage. For instance, ''this'' can replace a noun, with a meaning similar to ''it'' (or ''he''/''she''), e.g. in the sentence ''this is good for you''.

More information about pronouns, subjects etc. in English can be found in a different place. Here it is assumed that sufficient knowledge is available.

== Subject Personal Pronouns / Pronomi personali ==

&lt;b&gt;List of Subject Personal Pronouns:&lt;/b&gt;

Singular:
 io   - ''I''    - Note: no capital letter required
 tu   - ''you''  - Note: addressed to one person
 egli - ''he''   - Note: not used in common talk
 esso - ''it''   - Note: masculine, little used in common speech
 lui  - ''he''   - Note: colloquial
 ella - ''she''  - Note: not used in common talk
 essa - ''it''   - Note: feminine, little used in common speech
 lei  - ''she''  - Note: colloquial
 Lei  - ''you''  - Note: special use; normally with capital initial
 Ella - ''you''  - Note: special use, uncommon, capital initial

Plural:
 noi  - ''we''
 voi  - ''you''  - Note: addressed to two or more people
 Voi  - ''you''  - Note: same as 'voi' with lower case initial, but more formal (compare to 'Lei' in the singular)
 essi - ''they'' - Note: masculine
 esse - ''they'' - Note: feminine
 loro - ''they'' - Note: both masculine and feminine, colloquial
 Loro - ''you''  - Note: special use, uncommon, capital initial

The pronouns for the 1st person (singular: io, plural: noi) do not need special explanations.

The pronouns for the 2nd person (in English ''you'' both singular and plural) have a usage far more varied than in English.

'''Tu''' is addressed to one person only (singular) and is related to the older English ''thou''. It is felt to be informal. It is used with members of the same family (e.g. father, mother), with relatives (e.g. uncles), with children, with friends, and, in modern usage, with work colleagues. It is often used with boys and girls, and sometimes it is used with other persons in order to create a friendly atmosphere.

In the other cases (especially with grown-up people that are not friends or relatives) it is replaced by the pronoun '''Lei''' (usually written with a capital letter). This pronoun literally means ''she'' and its usage is similar to English sentences including ''His/Her Majesty''.

For the same purpose the pronoun '''Ella''' can also be used. This is felt today as obsolete and is used rarely only in writing.

When two or more people are addressed, '''voi''' is used both in formal and informal language - that is with relatives, friends and other people. The plural for ''Lei'' does exist, it is '''Loro''' (capital initial), but it is nowadays little used. Instead of '''Loro''', '''Voi''' is used, which is the same as '''voi''' but with a capital letter. 

The pronouns for the singular 3rd person (in English ''he''/''she''/''it'') take into account the gender of the replaced noun, which in Italian can only be masculine or feminine.

When referring to a person, ''he'' is translated as '''egli''' (proper language, rarely used in speech) or '''lui''' (colloquial), ''she'' as '''ella''' (rare in speech) or '''lei''' (colloquial).

For animals or things, ''it'' is translated as '''esso''' when the noun is masculine (e.g. ''lago'', lake) and as '''essa''' when it is feminine (e.g. ''barca'', boat).

Plural also takes into account the gender, so ''they'' is translated as '''essi''' (masc.) or '''esse''' (fem.). In colloquial talk ''they'' is usually translated as '''loro'''.

It should also be remembered that pronouns are required less often than in English because verb forms change for every person.  It's usually better to say ''Sono felice'' ([I] am happy) than ''Io sono felice'' (I am happy).

== Missing subject pronouns ==
In many languages, including English, French and German, the subject of the verb must be expressed. Pronouns are widely used to avoid repeating nouns for this purpose.

In Italian the subject is often omitted, as the verb can give sufficient information. Personal subject pronouns are far less used than in English. They are used only when there is a need for clarity or a wish to emphasize the pronoun itself.

&lt;b&gt;Examples of missing subjects:&lt;/b&gt;
 Piove. ''It is raining.'' No need to mention ''it''.
 Vengo subito. ''I come soon''. No need to mention ''I''.
 Dove vai? ''Where are you going?'' No need to mention ''you''.
 Dove andiamo? ''Where are we going?'' No need to mention ''we''.

&lt;b&gt;Example of special uses:&lt;/b&gt;
 Credo di sì. ''I think so''.
 Io credo di sì. ''I do think so''. The pronoun makes the assertion more emphatic.

'''1) '''In most cases the direct and indirect object pronouns are placed before the verb: '''''Ti''' vedo. ''I see you. One exception: ''loro'' as an indirect object is placed after the verb. Additionally, a few forms of the verb always have pronouns after them, but then they are postfixed (ie. written onto it as one word). These forms are the infinitive (dropping the final 'e', ie. ''vederlo''), the gerund and the past participle (but only when used alone, not as part of a perfect tense). For example 'I want to see him' is ''Voglio veder'''lo''''' and not ''voglio lo vedere''. Note that stress does not change when pronouns are appended, ie. ''&lt;u&gt;scri&lt;/u&gt;vere'' =&gt; ''&lt;u&gt;scri&lt;/u&gt;verlo'' and not ''scri&lt;u&gt;ver&lt;/u&gt;lo''

'''2) '''Note that 'Lei' and 'Voi' when indicating formal 'you' are capitalised, regardless of inflection (ie. ''Perché non '''Le''' piace questo film?. ''Why don't you like this movie? ). This rule also applies to postfixed 'Lei' and 'Voi', but there they may also occur in lower case (ie. I can see you. ''Posso veder'''La'''. ''or ''Posso veder'''la'''. '')

'''3) '''When two pronouns (or a pronoun and ''ci'' (there) or ''ne'' (form there/it)) are combined, the order is ''indirect + direct + ci/ne''. You will never encounter all three together, but for example if you have an indirect and a direct object, then the indirect will precede the direct. Additionally the preceding form changes: 
{| cellspacing=&quot;10&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;background: #DDD&quot;
| valign=&quot;middle&quot; |
{|
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background: #CCC; font-weight: bold;&quot; | Direct       
|-
| mi =&gt; || '''me'''
|-
| ti =&gt; || '''te'''
|-
| si =&gt; || '''se'''
|-
| lo =&gt; || lo
|-
| gli =&gt; || '''glie'''
|-
| la/La =&gt; || la/La
|-
| le/Le =&gt; || le/Le
|-
| ci =&gt; || '''ce'''
|-
| vi/Vi =&gt; || '''ve/Ve'''
|-
| li =&gt; || li
|-
| le =&gt; || le
|-
| gli =&gt; || '''glie'''
|}
|}
For example, 'He gives it to us' is '''''Ce''' lo dà''. ''Glie'' is affixed to the next word, so 'I give it to him/them' becomes '''''Glie'''lo do. ''

Another example is the verb ''andarsene'', which means to go away (''andare-si-ne'', lit. to go (oneself) from the place). It is conjugated ''me ne vado, te ne vai, se ne và, etc.''

As you can see in ''andarsene'' the postfixed pronouns are all written as one word. This is the rule for all such combinations, ie. ''Voglio dartelo. ''I want to give it to you. (=''dare-ti-lo'')



'''4) '''The prepositional forms are obligatory after prepositions: ''Vado '''da lui''' stasera. ''I'm going to his place tonight. 

They are also placed after the verb instead of the direct object to emphasize the pronoun (ie. ''Ho visto '''te'''. ''It is you I saw. - This is somewhat uncommon). 

They can replace the indirect object in a similar fashion, which is much more common, but these pronouns require the preposition ''a'' when indicating the indirect object (ie. ''Lo dirò '''a te''' prima che lo dica '''agli altri'''. ''I'll tell you before I tell any of the others. - As you can see in this sentence, nouns such as ''gli altri'' also need the preposition ''a'')

== Possessive Pronouns ==
Possessives, like articles, must agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify.  Hence, ''mio zio'', my uncle, but ''mia zia'', my aunt.  So depending on what is being modified, the possessive pronouns are:

* Masc. sing.: mio, tuo, suo, nostro, vostro, loro
* Fem. sing.: mia, tua, sua, nostra, vostra, loro
* Masc. pl.: miei, tuoi, suoi, nostri, vostri, loro
* Fem. pl.: mie, tue, sue, nostre, vostre, loro

In most cases the possessive adjective must be used ''with'' the definite article:

* Ho perso '''la mia''' penna. (I've lost my pen.)
* Mi piace '''il mio''' lavoro. (I like my job.)
* Hanno rubato '''la mia''' automobile! (They've stolen my car!)

The only exception is when the possessive refers to a family member in the singular:

* Sara è '''mia''' sorella (Sarah is my sister.)
* Questa penna è di '''mia''' zia. (This pen is my aunt's.)

But in the plural:

* '''Le mie''' zie sono vecchie (My aunts are old)

However, 'loro' always takes the definite article (also note that 'loro' does not change, for example the female form is 'loro', not 'lora' or something like that):

* '''La loro''' sorella è malata (Their sister is ill)

Personal pronouns can also be used on their own: 

* Questa macchina è '''la mia'''. (This car is mine)

To say 'one of my', 'one of your' etc. you use a personal pronoun with the indefinite article: 

* '''Un mio''' figlio è malato (One of my sons is ill)

And finally, possessives may be placed behind the noun it refers to in poetical language and specific expressions. If the definite article is used at all, it remains before the noun. 

* '''(Gli)''' affari '''tuoi''' (Your (own) business)
* Fatti gli affari '''tuoi'''! (Mind you own business!)

== Relative Pronouns ==
Relative pronouns are just pronouns, like those before this section but they refer to something relative to the context of
the sentence or the situation. the pronoun &quot;I&quot; will always refer to myself while the pronoun &quot;she&quot; will always refer to some &quot;her&quot;. A Relative pronoun can refer to a person, a thing or a situation. In English these pronouns are who, which, that, whom, where.

* Pronoun &lt;b&gt;che&lt;/b&gt;: this pronoun is used when you use which, who, and that.

* Pronouns &lt;b&gt;il quale, la quale, i quali, le quali&lt;/b&gt;: this pronoun &quot;quale&quot; is like the previous one but it also indicates the gender and number:
** il quale: masculine singular
** la quale: feminine singular
** i quali: masculine plural
** le quali: feminine plural

* Pronoun &lt;b&gt;cui&lt;/b&gt;: this pronouns introduces indirect objects (this means all those objects that need a preposition before it): “Headphone is the instrument (with) which you can hear music with” this pronoun needs “with” to work.

* Extra pronouns: &lt;b&gt;chi, colui, colei, coloro, ciò, chiunque, quanto,&lt;/b&gt; etc... words that serve the purpose of a pronoun.

== Demonstrative Pronouns ==
There are only two demonstrative pronouns: &lt;b&gt;questo&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;quello&lt;/b&gt;. Pay attention to how these pronouns change in gender and number.

* &lt;b&gt;questo, questa, questi, queste&lt;/b&gt;=this, these
* &lt;b&gt;quello, quella, quelli, quelle&lt;/b&gt;=that, those

'Questo' and related forms always use their full form. 'Quello' uses the full form as described above when on their own (for example, ''Questo è rotto.'' This one is broken.), but has a shorter form when used with a noun (''Quel problema non si può risolvere.'' That problem can't be solved.)

The form is dependent on the article you would use with the verb: 
* ''il'' =&gt; '''que''l'''''
* ''lo'' =&gt; '''quel''lo'''''
* ''la'' =&gt; '''quel''la'''''
* ''l''' =&gt; '''quel''l''''''
* ''i'' =&gt; '''que''i'''''
* ''le'' =&gt; '''quel''le'''''
* ''gli'' =&gt; '''que''gli'''''
For example, you would say ''gli uomini'', so you say ''quegli uomini''. These forms are also used when followed by a relative pronoun: ''Quel che voglio'' = What I want / The one that I want / That which I want.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Odds&quot; is a way of expressing the likelihood of an event.

The more usual way of expressing the likelihood of an event is its &quot;probability&quot; (the percentage of future trials which are expected to produce the event: so in tossing a coin believed to be fair, we would assign a probability of 50% (or one half, or 0.5) to the event &quot;heads&quot;).

The ODDS of an event, however, is the ratio of the probability of the event happening to the probability of the even not happening (i.e. the ODDS of a fair coin landing heads is 50%:50% = 1:1 = 1).  It is the ODDS we are using when we use a phrase like &quot;it is 50/50 whether I get the job&quot; or &quot;The chances of our team winning are 2 to 1&quot;.

Or, For example, when rolling a fair die, there is one chance that you will roll a 1 and five chances that you will not. The odds of rolling a 1 are 1:5, or 1 to 5.  This can also be expressed as &lt;math&gt;1/5&lt;/math&gt; or 0.2 or 20%, but these forms are likely to be misunderstood as normal probabilities rather than odds. 

To convert odds to probability, you add the two parts, and this is the denominator of the fraction of your probability. The first part becomes the numerator. Thus, 1:5 becomes 1/(1+5) or 1/6.

To convert probability to odds, you use the numerator as the first number, then subtract the numerator from the denominator and use it as the second number. Thus, 1/6 becomes 1:(6-1) or 1:5.

OK, you have your sounds and words, but you think that this alphabet we use is boring?  Well, you're in luck!  This page will give you a few hints and tips about creating your own writing system, commonly called a &quot;conscript&quot;.

== Types of script ==

To make an interesting writing system the last thing you want to do is copy the Roman script. So, before you actually start to create any glyphs (symbols), you will need to decide what kind of script you would like to make. Scripts are divided up by how many sounds are expressed per glyph.

* One glyph for an entire syllable (like Cherokee).
* Only glyphs for consonants (like Hebrew).
* One consonant per glyph with little marks for vowels (like Sanskrit).
* A separate glyph for each consonant and vowel (like English, or Hangul).
* One glyph for each unit of meaning or concept (like Chinese).

Naturally, you are not limited to just these types. You can modify or combine them to fit your language and style.

== Glyphs ==

Now that you have chosen the type of script you want, you get to design the glyphs themselves.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Think about how many distinct glyphs you will need.  How you determine this will depend on what type of script you have chosen.  In a script with very many glyphs, you will probably want most glyphs to have a fair amount of detail, so they can be readily told apart.
* Many cultures began writing with basic pictures of objects, such as the ancient Maya, or Egyptian Hieroglyphs.  These pictures were simplified and worn down over time into more abstract shapes.  For example, the letter ''A'' has its origins in a glyph representing the head of a bull.
* If you prefer to use symbols you can either do them by hand or start with pictures and write them fast with a pen or brush to see how they morph.
* If too many symbols are very similar or just turned versions of other symbols, they can be very confusing to read.  Although, if you are making a secret language, this might be your goal.
* Think about where your script is written.  Carved or etched letters will tend to have hard lines, while letters written by brush will often be flowing. A script originating as knots tied in a string &amp;mdash; a common ancient record-keeping technique &amp;mdash; may have a connecting line written through the middle of every letter.
* A cursive version of your script can be made by writing each of your letters as fast as you can.  If you make sure they still look different from each other, but slur them enough for speed, they ''should'' come out with a viable cursive form.
* Scalability.  How small can your glyphs get before details are lost and it is too difficult to distinguish one from another?  If you plan on creating a font for your writing system this will be important.

== Writing Direction ==

Okay, now you have your sounds and your symbols but you have one more thing to figure out: which way the words will be written.

* Top to Bottom
* Left to Right
* Right to Left
* Bottom to top
* Boustrophedon &amp;mdash; write one way until the end of the line and then write the opposite way from there for the next line:
{|
| &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
| First this way
|-
|
| align=right | yaw siht neht
|-
|
| and so on
|-
|
| align=right | htrof os dna
|}

You then need to find out which way the lines will go. For example, Japanese is written top to bottom and the lines go right to left. Arabic goes right to left but the lines go top to bottom. Some writing systems like Ogham are sometimes even written in a circle.

Now you can write in your own script!

= Objectives =

In this section you will learn about the different parts of Active Server Pages scripting.  We don't want to get too deep in discussion of how to write ASP scripts, but instead just want to introduce the different elements of ASP scripting.



= Content =

Active Server Pages or ASP is a scripted language which means that it doesn't have to be compiled in order to run.  Instead, the program code is parsed, interpreted and evaluated in real-time.  This means that you do not have to compile code in order to execute it.

Code is executed by placing it within a web page on a Web server.  ASP was developed by Microsoft and because of this, is only completely reliable on Microsoft's IIS (Internet Information Server.)  We encourage you to use Microsoft IIS to develop Active Server Page code.



== Statements ==

A statement is like a sentence in English, it describes one task for the ASP interpreter to perform.  A block of code is made up of multiple statements strung together on a web page.

There are various types of statements which we will talk about in the future including: &quot;(flow) control, output, assignment, and HTTP processing.

In Active Server Pages, it is important to realize that each statement must appear on a line by itself.  There is no special delimiter that indicates the end of an ASP statement.  Unless you consider the carriage-return as the delimiter, which you really shouldn't.

You can use the colon character &quot;:&quot; within a program block to place multiple statements on the same line such as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
Response.Write &quot;Error&quot; : Response.End
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In practice, it is best to avoid such programming constructs since it will make your code harder to read and maintain.

Another way to include more than one statement on a line is by using multiple code blocks like in the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;% If I &lt; 0 Then %&gt;Negative&lt;% End If %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, you have two different statements (even though they look like one statement) broken into two different code blocks.  Active Server Pages allows this construct on your web pages since it is sometimes necessary to write code like this to eliminate white space that appears on your web page.

== Variables ==

One of the hallmarks of a good scripting language is that the variables in the language are loosely typed.  This means that there is minimal type-checking done on the values of the variables your program code uses.  Active Server Pages was built correctly as a scripting language to be loosely typed.  This allows you, as the programmer, to worry less about what type a variable is which frees you from a lot of work converting values and testing for the correct type.

You are not required to declare your variables before you use them (or even at all if you so wish).  The one exception to this rule is when the page directive &quot;Option Explicit&quot; is in effect.  If you place the following at the top of your ASP page, you will be required to declare all variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt; &lt;% Option Explicit %&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

If you don't want this requirement in all your scripts, you can leave it out.  It is a useful tool to throw onto a page to check for mis-spelled or mis-used variable names.  If you mis-spelled a variable, you will likely see &quot;variable not defined&quot;.

Variables are declared with a '''Dim''' statement and can include a single variable at-a-time or a comma-delimited list of variable names like shown in the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;%
 Dim sPhoneNo
 Dim sFirstName, sMidleInitial, sLastName
 %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There is no such thing as a global variable in the ASP language.  All variables are specific to the web page they are processed in.  Once the page is done processing the values are lost.  One exception to this is the Application object. It can hold a number of different values, each of which is associated with a string value. Another way is to pass variables in a web form or part of the URL in the Request object. More information on these topics will be covered later.

== Comments ==

Comments are notations you can make on your web page within an ASP script block that will not be output on the web page. For all intents and purposes, they are hidden from your site visitors since they cannot view the ASP source code for your web pages.  This allows you to make comments about what your code is doing.

Active Server Pages uses the quote character (') to define comments. This comment is a &quot;line comment&quot; meaning that it will comment out everything following it up until the end of the line. There is no multi line comment in ASP.  In order to comment multiple lines, each line must be preceded by a quote (').

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;%
 ' example comment - show the current date
 Response.Write Now()
 %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Server-Side Includes (SSI) ==

Server-Side Includes allow you to retrieve code from one web page and insert it into another page.  This allows you to create common pieces of code and HTML which only need to be maintained in one place.  Other web pages can include this content within their pages using this server directive.

If you are using server-side include directives, you cannot place ASP code within the directive.  This is because the directive is evaluated before the ASP code is interpreted.  So trying to do something like the following is illegal:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- #include virtual=&quot;/lib/&lt;%= sLibName %&gt;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

But this doesn't mean that you can't place ASP code inside an included file.  So if you include a file called '''/lib/common.asp''', you can place ASP code inside that file (just like you would a normal ASP page) and it will be evaluated by IIS and the results will be placed in the calling page.

An interesting note is that your main page can use a &quot;.html&quot; extension and include (via SSI) an ASP page and the included file will be interpreted and processed as ASP and included in the HTML page.

The two different types of Server-Side includes allow you to retrieve and include files based on the absolute path (based on the Web site root) or relative to the calling page as shown below;

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%' absolute path - based on web site root %&gt;
&lt;!-- #include virtual=&quot;/pathtoinclude/include.asp&quot; --&gt;
&lt;%' relative path - based on folder of calling page  %&gt;
&lt;!-- #include file=&quot;../../folder1/include.asp&quot; --&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are benefits to using both.  A good rule of thumb is this: if you expect you will be moving entire folders (or trees) of your web application then relative paths are more appropriate.  If you expect things to stay pretty much where you created them then you should use absolute paths.

'''Please note:''' When using IIS6 (Windows 2003 Server), relative paths are not enabled by default, which will cause any Server-Side includes using relative paths to cease functioning.

: I ''tentativly'' agree. Any ideas on which topics to move?  -- [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 19:08, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Probably most of the material in the &quot;Glyphs&quot; section, and the bit about boustrophedon in the &quot;Writing Direction&quot; section.  Also the &quot;now you can write in your own script&quot; bit. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 21:14, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

::: I should mention that I'm a little wary of editing this article myself due to an off-wiki incident that I don't want to get into. But, by all means, go ahead yourself. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 18:43, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

== Recommendation ==

The Beginner section is supposed to avoid overwhelming the novice with details and technical terms.  I'm not going to prune right now, because Intermediate/Writing is itself in trouble, and it seems prudent to wait to prune here until after one can compare this to a stable version of that.  At a minimum, though, the terms for different types of scripts (abugidas, etc.) don't belong here, and the detailed identifications of different examples are a bit overwhelming too.  If there are parentheticals under the script type bullets at all, they should probably be short and sweet, like they were a year or more ago.  (The introduction of the distinction between Japanese kana and kanji, which looked like such a reasonable step at the time since one certainly doesn't want misinformation in the Beginner section, seems to have been where these parentheticals started down the slippery slope to where they are now.)

:Okay, I've done the &quot;minimum&quot;, lopping off the technical terms and detailed examples from the types of scripts.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:26, 5 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

= Objectives =


In this section you will learn about variables in Active Server Pages.  This includes naming conventions, how they are declared, different primitive types and naming conventions.  After studying this section, you should have a firm grasp of the types of variables available to you and how to work with different types in a web application.

= Content =

All variables in ASP are loosely typed.  This means that you don't need to declare variables with a type.  It also means that you can assign the value of any variable to any other variable.  There are a few exceptions to this rule as we will see.

Basically, every variable in ASP has the major type of Variant.  It is &quot;variant&quot; meaning that the type of value it holds can vary.  Basically, the ASP interpreter will handle all conversion between types automatically when you group more than one variable or type together in a single expression.

== Variable Scope ==

There are three different scopes for variables used in ASP.  The first is page scope meaning that the variable is available for the entire duration.  These are typically declared at the top of the page.  The second type of variables are procedure scoped variables which are declared inside a procedure or function declaration.  The third type of variables are scoped with a class definition which is used for object-oriented programming.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;%
 Dim sStr1      ' page-scoped variable
 ....

 Procedure DoSomething
     Dim mStr2     ' procedure-scoped variable
 End Procedure

 Function DoSomething
     Dim mStr2     ' function-scoped variable
 End Function

 Class clsTest
     Private msStr4   ' class-scoped variable
     Public msStr5    ' class-scoped variable
 End Class
 %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Page-scoped variables will be visible to all code included on your web page including procedures and functions.  You can even access page-scoped variables within a class although good object-oriented design would strongly discourage this practice.

Procedure-scoped variables will only be visible within the procedure in which they are defined.   It is perfectly acceptable to use the same variable name for a page-scoped variable and a procedure-scoped variable.  Keep in mind, that when you do this, you will hide the page-scoped variable and will have no way to access it within the procedure.

Class-scoped variables can only be accessed through an instance of the class.  There is no notion of static variables or static methods in the simplified ASP scripting language.  You will need to use the '''ObjectName.VariableName''' syntax in order to access member variables directly.  Only variable declared '''Public''' can be accessed in this way.  Private class variables can only be accessed by code defined within the class.  More information about using classes in Active Server Pages will be discussed later.

== Valid Variable Names ==

To be valid, an ASP variable name must follow the following rules:

* Must begin with an alphabetic character
* All other characters must be alphanumeric or underscore (&quot;_&quot;)
* Name must not exceed 255 characters in length
* Name must be unique within the scope it is defined
* Name must not be the same as a reserved word of built in functions, procedures, and objects.

Variable names, just like statements are case-insensitive.  This means that if you declare a variable with the name &quot;myVar&quot;, you can access it using &quot;MYVAR&quot; or &quot;myvar&quot; or even &quot;MyVaR&quot;.

One way to avoid using reserved words and make it easier to identify what type of variables you are using is to use a naming convention. Usually the first letter or few letters of the variable names what information it holds.

Examples:
* nCount n for integer or number, holds a value that is used to count something, like for control loops.
* sName s for string, holds a value that represents a name.
* bIsActive b for boolean, holds true or false values, in this case true if something is active, false if it is not.

Following a naming convention can help avoid messy code, and leads to good programming habits. It also allows somebody else to work with your code and help debug it or modify it. Along with a naming convention, use comments as well to document what the variable is to be used for in the ASP page.

Examples:
* &lt;code&gt;Dim nCount    'Used to count values in control loops.&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Dim sName     'Used to store the user's name that they enter in a web form.&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Dim bIsActive   'Used to test if the user's account is active.&lt;/code&gt;

You will learn more on naming conventions later on in this document.

== Declaring Variables ==

To declare a variable, you use the '''Dim''' statement for page and procedure-scoped variables.  After the '''Dim''' statement, you can put a comma-separated list of variable names.  If you prefer, you can just put one variable on each line.  This allows you to add comments about each variable you declare.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;%
 Dim sAction     ' form action
 Dim sQuery      ' database query
 Dim I, J, K
 %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You should place your variables in a consistent location on the page or within your procedures.  Typically, most people place the declarations at the very top (beginning) of the page or the top of the procedure.  Others think it makes more sense to place the variable declarations right above the location where they are first used.

== Primitive Types ==

When we talk about primitive types, we are talking about low-level variables types that cannot be broken down into smaller primitive types.  Basically, these are the &quot;built-in&quot; variables that Active Server Pages understands.

These are sometimes referred to the &quot;sub-type&quot; of the variable since the major type of the variable is &quot;variant&quot;.  Each variable may have one of the sub-types shown in the following table.  If you have used other programming languages, then these primitive types will be very familiar to you.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type Name
! Values
! Memory
! Example
|-
| Boolean || True or False || 2 Bytes?
| true
|-
| Byte || 0 to 255 || 1 Byte || 127
|-
| String || Any unicode characters || Unlimited
| &quot;unicode: &amp;#234;&quot;
|-
| Int || -32,768 to 32,767 || 2 Bytes || 147
|-
| Long || -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
| 4 Bytes || 3458972
|-
| Single
| 1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E38 (pos)&lt;br&gt;-3.402823E38 to -1.401298E-45 (neg)
| 4 Bytes || 23.546234
|-
| Double
| 4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232E308 (pos)&lt;br&gt;-1.79769313486232E308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 (neg)
| 8 Bytes || 43872452.23445
|-
| Currency
| -922,337,203,685,477.5808 and 922,337,203,685,477.5807
| 8 Bytes || 132412.34
|-
| Datetime || 01/01/100 to 12/31/9999 || 8 Bytes
| '09/23/2004 12:34 AM'
|-
| Object || An object reference || 8 Bytes?
| Server.CreateObject(&quot;...&quot;)
|}

=== Special Values ===

In addition to the values shown above, the following special values may also be assigned to Active Server Page variables:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type Name
! Values
! Memory
! Example
|-
| Empty || vbEmpty || 2 Bytes? || vbEmpty
|-
| Null || null || 2 Bytes? || null
|}

The empty value is the default value for newly declared variables (never assigned any value.)  If tested in a boolean context, it is equivalent to &quot;false&quot; or tested in a string context it is equivalent to the empty string (&quot;&quot;)

=== Conversion and Verification ===

You don't need to concern yourself much with setting the type of the variable.  This is done pretty much automatically for you.  In the event that you want to set the type that is assigned to a variable, you can use the ASP conversion function that corresponds to each type.

Also, there are verification functions available to make sure a variable is compatible with the specified type.  This doesn't mean that the variable has that sub-type.  Rather, it means that the variable can successfully be converted to the type.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type Name
! Convert
! Verify
|-
| Boolean || CBool || ''n/a''
|-
| Byte || CByte || IsNumeric
|-
| String || CStr || ''n/a''
|-
| Int || CInt || IsNumeric
|-
| Long || CLng || IsNumeric
|-
| Single || CSng || IsNumeric
|-
| Double || CDbl || IsNumeric
|-
| Currency || CCur || IsNumeric
|-
| Datetime || CDate || IsDate
|-
| Object || ''n/a'' || IsObject
|-
| Empty || ''n/a'' || IsEmpty
|-
| Null || ''n/a'' || IsNull
|}

== Literal Values ==

Literal values are values you insert into your ASP code and use in expressions.  By itself, a literal value has no use, but when used in a statement such as an assignment or output statement

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;%
 ' examples of literal values
 Dim sString, nInt, fFloat, dDate, bBool

 sString = &quot;Hello There&quot;
 nInt = 1234
 fFloat = -25.324
 dDate = DateSerial(2004, 10, 28)
 bBool = True
 %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You will notice that there is no way to specify a date literal in ASP.  Therefore, you need to use a function call to build a date value using '''DateSerial''' or you can use '''Now()''' to get the current date and time.

The value for a literal value is bound by the limits specified in the table for primitive types above.  If you attempt to use a value that is outside the acceptable range for any of the types, you will receive an error message indicating this fact and your ASP page will terminate execution.

== Constant Definitions ==

In some cases, you might want to create &quot;named constants&quot; instead of using literal values all of the time.  This is particularly useful if you create a common include file that will be used in multiple scripts on your site.  You define constants using the '''Const''' keyword like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;%
 Const PI = 3.141592654
 Const RECS_PER_PAGE = 25
 Const FSO_FORREADING = 1
 Const FSO_FORWRITING = 0
 %&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It is common practice to use all uppercase variables for your constant definitions although this is not required.  It simply makes your code easier to read and maintain.

== Naming Conventions ==

A naming convention is a standard way of naming all of the variables used on your site.  There are various different methods used for naming variables and a whole chapter could be devoted to this subject.  One of the most popular is Hungarian notation where the first letter of the variable name indicates the dominant sub-type for the variable.



{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type Name
! Letter
! Example
|-
| Boolean || b || bIsMale
|-
| Byte || z || zAge
|-
| String || s || sFirstname
|-
| Int || n || nAge
|-
| Long || l || lPageHits
|-
| Single || f || fScore
|-
| Double || d || dMass
|-
| Currency || m || mBalance
|-
| Datetime || d || dExpiration
|-
| Object || o || oFSO
|}

The Microsoft standard proposed for Visual Basic is to use a 3-letter naming convention for their variables.  This is a little more clear for reading and maintaining code.  Some would consider this overkill for a light-weight scripting language.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Type Name
! Letter
! Example
|-
| Boolean || bln || blnIsMale
|-
| Byte || byt || bytAge
|-
| String || str || strFirstname
|-
| Int || int || intAge
|-
| Long || lng || lngPageHits
|-
| Single || sng || sngScore
|-
| Double || dbl || dblMass
|-
| Currency || cur || curBalance
|-
| Datetime || dat || datExpiration
|-
| Object || obj || objFSO
|}

The human brain is an amazing piece of work. Every time you utter a sound, or hear one, there are dozens of things that happen subconsciously and take the sound and reduce it to one of several distinct sounds that we use in our language. The problem is that these distinct sounds are different in different languages. When you come into a new language and you hear a sound you're not used to, you automatically try to fit it into one of your previous categories of sounds. This can cause interesting problems.

Let's illustrate this with a (slightly-hypothetical) analogy. There is one group of people from the Land of Men, and another from the Land of Women. In the Land of Men there are only a few colours: red, blue, brown, yellow, pink, green, and a few more. In the Land of Women, however, there are many more: chartreuse, magenta, terracotta, viridian, lavender rose, etc. Whole books could be written about the colours in the land of women, and indeed, some have.

When the men visit the Land of Women, they have no end of trouble. You see their road signs are colour-coded. The women have no problem with this. Their stop signs are rust-coloured and their yield signs are painted in auburn. Now the men, they look at both of these colours and see brown. So as far as they can tell, all stop signs are brown in the Land of Women; however, sometimes women will stop at the stop signs and sometimes they drive right through. Obviously the women must be terrible drivers. Likewise, the women notice the men have an annoying habit of always stopping at yield signs.

Similarly, speakers of different languages compartmentalize the sounds they hear in words into different categories. For instance, in English the words 'toe' and 'so' are distinguished by their initial consonants: 'toe' begins with the sound /t/ while 'so' begins with /s/. However, many speakers of the language Tok Pisin do not differentiate between these sounds, and they may be interchanged without changing the meaning of words (e.g. [tupu] or [supu] for the word ''tupu'', meaning 'soup'). Thus knowing how languages classify sounds is at least as important as knowing what sounds they use in the first place.

We can speak of a language's '''phonology''' as being how it carves up the acoustic space into meaningful units. This is an area of study practiced by ''phonologists''.

== Phonemes ==

The basic unit of study of phonology is the '''phoneme''', which may be defined as sets of phones which function as one unit in a language, and provide contrast between different words. In other words, a phoneme is a category that speakers of a language put certain sounds into. For instance, returning to the Tok Pisin example above, the sounds [s] and [t] would both belong to the phoneme /t/. (In the IPA, phonemes are conventionally enclosed in forward slashes //.)

As another example, try pronouncing the English words ''keys'' and ''schools'' carefully, paying close attention to the variety of [k] in each. You should find that in the first there is a noticeable puff of air ('''aspiration'''), while in the second it is absent. These words may be written more precisely phonetically as [kʰiz] and [skulz]. However, since aspiration never changes the meaning of a word, both of these sounds belong to the phoneme /k/, and so the phonetic representations of these words are /kiz/ and /skulz/.

It should be evident why it is appropriate to refer to the phoneme as a '''level of abstraction''' away from the phone. We have removed a layer of information which, while interesting in itself, does not interact in many aspects of a language.

The phonemic inventory of a language is the collection of phonemes in a language. We looked at English's in the last chapter.

=== Allophony ===
Two phones are called '''allophones''' if they belong to the same phoneme. For instance, in Tok Pisin [t] and [s] are allophones of /t/, and in English [k] and [kʰ] are allophones of /k/.

Allophones are often conditioned by their environment, meaning that one can figure out which allophone is used based on context. For example, in most varieties of American English, the English phoneme /t/ is realized as a tap [ɾ] between vowels in normal speech when not preceding a stressed vowel, for example in the word &quot;butter&quot;. In a case like this we can say that the plosive [t] and tap [ɾ] allophones of the phoneme /t/ are in '''complementary distribution''', as every environment selects for either one or the other, and the allophones themselves may be referred to as '''complementary allophones'''. Similarly [k] and [kʰ] are in complementary distribution, as [k] mainly occurs in the sequence /sk/, while [kʰ] occurs elsewhere/

By contrast, allophones may sometimes co-occur in the same environment, in which case they are in '''free variation'''. For example, the English word ''cat'''s word-final /t/ phoneme may be realized either with an audible release, or as the tongue held in the gesture without being released. These phones, notated as [t] and [t̚] in the IPA, are '''free variants''', as either is allowed to occur in the same position. Similarly [s] and [t] are free variants for some speakers of Tok Pisin.

=== Minimal pairs ===

An important question which may have occurred to you already is: how can we tell what is a phoneme? One of the most robust tools for examining phonemes is the '''minimal pair'''. A minimal pair is a pair of words which differ only in one segment. For example, the English words ''do'' /du/, ''too'' /tu/, ''you'' /ju/, ''moo'' /mu/ all form minimal pairs with each other. In a minimal pair one can be sure that the difference between the words is phonemic in nature, because the segments in question are surrounded by the same environment and thus cannot be allophones of each other. In other words, they are in '''contrastive distribution'''.

This is not a foolproof tool. In some cases it may by chance be impossible to find a minimal pair for two phonemes even though they clearly contrast. In many cases it is possible to find near-minimal pairs, where the words are so similar that it is unlikely that any environment is conditioning an allophone.

Finally this also requires some common sense, since phonemes may be in complementary distribution without being likely allophones. For instance, the English phonemes /h/ and /ŋ/ (both occurring in the word ''hung'' /hʌŋ/) can never occur in the same environment, as /h/ is always syllable-initial and /ŋ/ always syllable-final. However few would suggest that these phonemes are allophones. Since English speakers never confuse them, they are auditorily quite different, and substituting one for another in a word would render it unintelligible. Unfortunately there is no hard-and-fast consensus on precisely how to be sure sounds are allophones or not, and in many languages there is vigorous debate.

== Phonological Rules ==

=== Phonotactics ===
'''Phonotactics''' are the rules that govern how phonemes can be arranged. Look at the following lists of made-up words:

* ''Pfilg''
* ''Dchbin''
* ''Riaubg''
* ''Streelling''
* ''Mard''
* ''Droib''

The first three are 'unpronounceable' because they violate English's '''phonotatic constraints''': 'pf' and 'dchb' aren't allowed at the start of a syllable, while 'bg' isn't allowed at the end. The next three are nonsensical words, but they do not violate phonotactics, so they have an 'English-like' feel. Lewis Carroll was particularly skilled in the art of creating such words. Some of his creations were immortalised in his poem ''Jabberwocky''. Here are a couple of stanzas from his famed work:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves&lt;br/&gt;
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;&lt;br/&gt;
All mimsy were the borogoves,&lt;br/&gt;
And the mome raths outgrabe.

&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!&lt;br/&gt;
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!&lt;br/&gt;
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun&lt;br/&gt;
The frumious Bandersnatch!&quot;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Note that different langauges have different phonotactics. The Czech Republic has cities like Brno and Plzeň, while the Mandarin for Amsterdam is Amusitedan. Czech phonotactics allow for really complicated consonant clusters, while Mandarin allows for none.

=== Coarticulation Effects ===

== Morphophonology ==

'''Morphophonology''' (or '''morphophonemics''') looks at how morphology (the structure of words) interacts with phonology. In morphophonology one may talk about ''underlying'' or ''morpho-phonemic'' representations of words, which is a level of abstraction beneath the phonemic level. To see how this follows from the definition of morphophonology, it is necessary to look at an example. Compare the Biloxi words:

*''de'' 'he goes' - ''da'' 'don't go'
*''ande'' 'he is' - ''anda'' 'be!'
*''ide'' 'it falls' - ''ide'' 'fall!'
*''da'' 'he gathers' - ''da'' 'gather!'

Some also use this approach to deal with cases of '''neutralization''' and '''underspecification'''. Compare the Turkish words:
* ''et'' 'meat'
** ''eti'' 'his meat'
* ''et'' 'to do'
** ''edi'' 'he does'
Similar patterns in other words in Turkish show that while final stops are always devoiced, some will always voice when followed by a vowel added by suffixing, while the others always stay voiceless. Phonemically both ''et''s must be represented as /et/, because phonemes are defined as the smallest units that may make words contrast (be distinguishable), so if we said the word for 'to do' was phonemically /ed/ then the two words would have to contrast! Still, we would like to say that on a more abstract level the word for 'to do' ends in a different segment, which doesn't '''surface''' (be realized) in some positions. The level of abstraction above the phoneme is known as an '''underlying''' or '''morpho-phonemic representation''', and as is conventional we will indicate it here with pipes ||.&lt;ref&gt;Other conventions, such as double pipes || || or double slashes // // may also be seen.&lt;/ref&gt; Underlyingly, these Turkish words may be represented as |et|, |eti|, |ed|, and |edi|, and in the same way other Turkish words with this type of voicing alternation underlyingly end in a voiced stop, which surfaces as a voiceless phoneme when word-final.

The parallelism between the morpho-phonemic layer and the phonemic layer should be clear. Just like how phonemes surface as phones conditioned by their environment, underlying segments surface as phonemes. The important difference is that the surfacing of morpho-phonemic segments as phonemes occurs after morphological processes (e.g. adding endings on to words) take place. In a sense, morphophonology is morphologically informed, while plain phonology isn't.

== Issues ==

In some theoretical frameworks of speech (such as phonetics and phonology for applied linguistics and language teaching or speech therapy), it is convenient to break up a language's sounds into categorical sounds&amp;mdash;that is, sound types called 'phonemes'. The construct of the phoneme, however, is largely a phonological concern in that it is supposed to model and refer to a transcendental entity that superstructurally and/or psychologically sits over the phonetic realizations and common variations of a sound in a language. 

For example, if the English phoneme /l/ is posited to subsist, it might be said to do so because the /l/ of 'light' creates a clear contrast with a phonetically similar sounding word, such as 'right' or 'write' (both of which have a distinct /r/ at the beginning instead of a distinct /l/). Thus, 'light' and 'write' are a 'minimal pair' illustrating that, in English at least, phonemic /l/ and phonemic /r/ are distinct sound categories, and that such a distinction holds for realized speech.

Such a model has the profound weakness of circular logic: phonemes are used to delimit the semantic realm of language (lexical or higher level meaning), but semantic means (minimal pairs of words, such as 'light' vs. 'right' or 'pay' vs. 'bay') are then used to define the phonological realm. Moreover, if phonemes and minimal pairs were such a precise tool, why would they result in such large variations of the sound inventories of languages (such as anywhere from 38&amp;ndash;50 phonemes for counts of English)? Also, it is the case that most words (regardless of homophones like 'right' and 'write', or minimal pairs like 'right' and 'light') differentiate meaning on much more information than a contrast between two sounds. 

The phoneme is really a structuralist and/or psycholinguistic category belonging to phonology that is supposed to subsist ideally over common variations (called 'allophones') but be realized in such ways as the so-called 'clear' [l] at the beginning of a word like 'like' but also as the so-called 'dark' [l] at the end of a word like 'feel'. 

Such concerns are really largely outside of the realm of phonetics because structuralist and/or psycholinguistic categories are really about cognitive and mentalist aspects of language processing and acquisition. In other words, the phoneme may (or may not) be a reality of phonology; it is in no way an actual physical part of realized speech in the vocal tract. Realized speech is highly co-articulated, displays movement and spreads aspects of sounds over entire syllables and words. It is convenient to think of speech as a succession of segments (which may or may not coincide closely with phonemes, ideal segments) in order to capture it for discussion in written discourse, but actual phonetic analysis of speech confounds such a model. It should be pointed out, however, that if we wish to set down a representation of dynamic, complex speech into static writing, constructs like phonemes are very convenient fictions to indicate what we are trying to set down (alternative units in order to capture language in written form, though, include the syllable and the word).

=== Exercise 1: Kalaallisut ===

Kalaallisut, or Greenlandic, is an Eskimo-Aleut language spoken by most of the population of Greenland, and has more speakers than all other Eskimo-Aleut languages combined. While Kalaallisut is currently written using five vowel letters, it is analyzed as having only three underlying vowel phonemes. From the following words, deduce Kalaallisut's phonemic vowel inventory and what conditions the allophonic vowels:

* '''assaat''' - forearm
* '''assoqquppaa''' - goes windward of it
* '''assoruuppoq''' - pulls himself together
* '''ilisimannippoq''' - has knowledge of something
* '''isuma''' - mind
* '''kikkut''' - which, whom, whose (pl.)
* '''mulequt''' - leaf
* '''nukarlersaat''' - the youngest of them
* '''nuliariipput''' - they are married
* '''orsuut''' - blubber
* '''paamaarpoq''' - is slow
* '''paaq''' - soot
* '''qinnilinnik piiaat''' - screwdriver
* '''sakiak''' - rib
* '''terlippoq''' - is safe
* '''uagut''' - we
* '''utoqqaq''' - old
* '''uffarvik''' - bathtub
* '''ullortuvoq''' - the day is long
* '''versi''' - verse

==Introduction==

''Functions'' (or ''methods'' in the context of a class/object) are a way to group common tasks or calculations to be re-used simply.

Functions in computer programming are much like mathematical functions: You can give the function values to work with and get a result without having to do any calculations yourself.

You can also find a huge list of predefined functions built into PHP in the [http://www.php.net/manual/en/funcref.php PHP Manual's function reference].

==How to call a function==
Note that '''echo''' is not a function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://php.net/echo echo]&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Calling a function&quot; means causing a particular function to run at a particular point in the script. The basic ways to call a function include:
*calling the function to write on a new line (such as after a &quot;;&quot; or &quot;}&quot;)
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
print('I am human, I am.');
&lt;/source&gt;
*calling the function to write on a new line inside a control
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if ($a == 72) {
  print('I am human, I am.');
}
&lt;/source&gt;
*assigning the returned value of a function to a variable &quot;$var = function()&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$result = sum ($a, 5);
&lt;/source&gt;
*calling a function inside the argument parentheses (expression) of a control
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
while ($i &lt; count($one)) {
  
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In our earlier examples we have called several functions. Most commonly we have called the function ''print()'' to print text to the output. The parameter for echo has been the string we wanted printed (for example ''print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)'' prints &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the output).

If the function returns some information we assign it to a variable with a simple ''='':
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$var1 = func_name();
&lt;/source&gt;

==Parameters==
Parameters are variables that exist only within that function. They are provided by the programmer when the function is called and the function can read and change them locally (except for reference type variables, which are changed globally - this is a more advanced topic).

When declaring or calling a function that has more than one parameter, you need to separate between different parameters with a comma ','.

A function declaration can look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function print_two_strings($var1, $var2)
{
  echo $var1;
  echo &quot;\n&quot;;
  echo $var2;
  return NULL;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To call this function you must give the parameters a value. It doesn't matter what the value is, as long as there is one.

function call:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
print_two_strings(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
Output:

 Hello
 World

When declaring a function you sometimes want to have the freedom not to use all the parameters, therefore PHP allows you to give them default values when declaring the function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function print_two_strings($var1 = &quot;Hello World&quot;, $var2 = &quot;I'm Learning PHP&quot;)
{
  echo($var1);
  echo(&quot;\n&quot;);
  echo($var2);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

These values will only be used, if the function call does not include enough parameters. If there is only one parameter provided then '''$var2''' = &quot;I'm Learning PHP&quot;.

function call:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
print_two_strings(&quot;Hello&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
Output:

 Hello
 I'm Learning PHP

Another way to have a dynamic number of parameters is to use PHP's built-in ''func_num_args'', ''func_get_args'', and ''func_get_arg'' functions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function mean()
{
  $sum = 0;
  $param_count = func_num_args();
  for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $param_count; $i++)
  {
    $sum += func_get_arg($i);
  }
  $mean = $sum / $param_count;
  echo &quot;Mean: {$mean}&quot;;
  return NULL;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Or:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 function mean()
 {
  $sum = 0;
  $vars = func_get_args();
  for ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($vars); $i++)
  {
    $sum += $vars[$i];
  }
  $mean = $sum / count($vars);
  echo &quot;Mean: {$mean}&quot;;
  return NULL;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The above functions would calculate the [[Wikipedia:Arithmetic_mean|arithmetic mean]] of all of the values passed to them and output it. The difference is that the first function uses ''func_num_args'' and ''func_get_arg'', while the second uses ''func_get_args'' to load the parameters into an array. The output for both of them would be the same. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
mean(35, 43, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 Mean: 27

==Returning a value==

This function is all well and good, but usually you will want your function to return some information. Generally there are two reasons why a programmer would want information from a function:
# The function does tasks such as calculations, and we need the result.
# A function can return a value to indicate, if the function encountered any errors.

To return a value from a function use the ''return()'' statement in the function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function add_numbers($var1 = 0, $var2 = 0, $var3 = 0)
{
  $var4 = $var1 + $var2 + $var3;
  return $var4;
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Example PHP script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function add_numbers($var1 = 0, $var2 = 0, $var3 = 0)
{
  $var4 = $var1 + $var2 + $var3;
  return $var4;
}
 
$sum = add_numbers(1, 6, 9);
echo &quot;The result of 1 + 6 + 9 is {$sum}&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Result:

 The result of 1 + 6 + 9 is 16

Notice that a ''return()'' statement ends the function's course. If anything appears in a function declaration after the ''return()'' statement is executed, it is parsed but not executed. This can come in handy in some cases. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function divide ($dividee, $divider) {
  if ($divider == 0) {
    //Can't divide by 0.
    return false;
  }
  $result = $dividee/$divider;
  return $result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice that there is no ''else'' after the ''if''. This is due to the fact that if ''$divider'' does 
equal 0, the ''return()'' statement is executed and the function stops.

If you want to return multiple variables, you need to return an array rather than a single variable. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function maths ($input1, $input2) {
  $total = ($input1 + $input2);
  $difference = ($input1 - $input2);
  $return = array(&quot;tot&quot; =&gt; $total, &quot;diff&quot; =&gt; $difference);
  return $return;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When calling this from your script, you need to call it into an array. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$return = maths(10, 5);
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case ''$return['tot']'' will be the total (e.g. 15), while ''$return['diff']'' will be the difference (5).

==Runtime function usage==
A developer can create functions inside a PHP script without having to use the '''function name($param...) {}''' syntax. This can be done by way of programming that can let you run functions dynamically.

===Executing a function that is based on a variable's name===
There are two ways to do it: either using direct call or the ''call_user_func'' or the ''call_user_func_array'':

====Using ''call_user_func*'' functions to call functions====
''call_user_func'' and ''call_user_func_array'' only differ in that the ''call_user_func_array'' allows you to use the second parameter as array to pass the data very easily, and ''call_user_func'' has an infinite number of parameters that is not very useful in a professional way.
In these examples, a class will be used for a wider range of using the example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
class Some_Class {
  function my_function($text1, $text2, $text3) {
    $return = $text1 . &quot;\n\n&quot; . $text2 . &quot;\n\n&quot; . $text3;
    return $return;
  }
}
$my_class = new Some_Class();
&lt;/source&gt;

Using ''call_user_func'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$one = &quot;One&quot;;
$two = &quot;Two&quot;;
$three = &quot;Three&quot;;
$callback_func = array(&amp;$my_class, &quot;my_function&quot;);
$result = call_user_func($callback_func, $one, $two, $three);
echo $result;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using ''call_user_func_array'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$one = &quot;One&quot;;
$two = &quot;Two&quot;;
$three = &quot;Three&quot;;
$callback_func = array(&amp;$my_class, &quot;my_function&quot;);
$result = call_user_func_array($callback_func, array($one, $two, $three));
echo $result;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how ''call_user_func'' and ''call_user_func_array'' are used in both of the examples. ''call_user_func_array'' allows the script to execute the function more dynamically.

As there was no example of using both of these functions for a non-class function, here they are:
Using ''call_user_func'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$one = &quot;One&quot;;
$two = &quot;Two&quot;;
$three = &quot;Three&quot;;
$callback_func = &quot;my_function&quot;;
$result = call_user_func($callback_func, $one, $two, $three);
echo $result;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using ''call_user_func_array'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$one = &quot;One&quot;;
$two = &quot;Two&quot;;
$three = &quot;Three&quot;;
$callback_func = &quot;my_function&quot;;
$result = call_user_func_array($callback_func, array($one, $two, $three));
echo $result;
&lt;/source&gt;

====More complicated examples====
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$my_func($param1, $param2);
$my_class_name = new ClassObject();
$my_class_name-&gt;$my_func_from_that_class($param1, $param2);
// The -&gt; symbol is a minus sign follow by a &quot;larger than&quot; sign. It allows you to
// use a function that is defined in a different PHP class. It comes directly from
// object-oriented programming. Via a constructor, a function of that class is
// executable. This specific example is a function that returns no values.
call_user_func($my_func, $param1, $param2);

call_user_func(array(&amp;${$my_class_name}, $my_func), $param1, $param2);
// Prefixing a &amp; to a variable that represents a class object allows you to send the
// class object as a reference instead of a copy of the object. In this example this
// means that $my_class_name Object would have a copy made of it, the function will
// act on the copy, and when the function ends. The original object wouldn't suffer
// modifications. Passing an object through its reference passes the address in memory
// where that object is stored and call_user_func will alter the actual object.

call_user_func_array($my_func, array($param1, $param2));
// Most powerful, dynamic example
call_user_func_array(array(&amp;${$my_class_name}, $my_func), array($param1, $param2)); 
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function positif ($x + $y;) {
  $x = 2;
  $y = 5;
  $z = $x + $y;
  echo $z;
}
positif = $x + $y;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Creating runtime functions===
Creating runtime functions is a very good way of making the script more dynamic:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$function_name = create_function('$one, $two', 'return $one + $two;');
echo $function_name . &quot;\n\n&quot;;
echo $function_name(&quot;1.5&quot;, &quot;2&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

''create_function'' creates a function with parameters ''$one'' and ''$two'', with a code to evaluate return…
When ''create_function'' is executed, it stores the function's info in the memory and returns the function's name. This means that you cannot customise the name of the function although that would be preferred by most developers.

== Error ==

This isn't correct:
''Thus, Italian scholars called for a 'renascence' (most likely from which &quot;Renaissance&quot; is derived, meaning 'rebirth') in European education and culture.'' 
The term renaissance means &quot;rebirth in French&quot;

Fixed the error; sorry about any confusion it might have caused. --[[User:Ccny930|Ccny930]] 00:07, 29 June 2007 (UTC)

== Use of the term Dark Ages ==

The term &quot;the dark ages&quot; has been proven to be more the invention of earlier historians who tended to view the middle ages as a period where knowledge was lost in a mist of ignorance and superstition. Its also referred to as &quot;the dark ages&quot; because there were gaps in our knowledge of this period. The loss of knowledge has been proven not to be the case and we're filling in the historical gaps. Admittedley the main thrust of modern thinking came from the Renaissance but to imagine that the Acropolis (such a visible remnant of Classical Greece) or the works of Herodotus or Virgil were not studied is wrong. The Renaissance may actual be an &quot;information&quot; revolution (just as we're now experiencing with the internet) and that knowledge was not lost but simply was not widely available to study. Its not so much that the West was devoid of knowledge and enquiry  - more probable that the invention of the printing press allowed for the greater availability of books and this is turn led to more studies of the classics by more people. There are countless other Renaissance inventions like the telescope, modern banking, clocks, new sea routes and much more that made the Renaissance &quot;information highway&quot; a borderless conduit for knowledge.

I'll remove the term when I come across it though if anyone disagrees please feel free to revert my edits.

= Objectives =

In this section we will introduce the basic program flow-control statements available to you in Active Server Pages.  This includes conditional statement and looping constructs.  After studying this section, you should have a good understanding of how to use Active Server Pages to make decisions based on expressions.  You should also understand how to repeat a block of program code based on conditions you define.

= Content =

Conditional statements are used by your program to make decisions and decide what the program should do next.  An example of this would be deciding whether a user has entered the correct password for your site by comparing the password entered with the correct password.  If the user passes the test, they are sent to their account management Web page.  If they fail, they are sent back to the login screen with an error indicating the &quot;password is invalid&quot;.

This kind of decision making is common in all programming languages.  You need to master this aspect of Active Server Pages in order to write dynamic web applications.

Another important concept is looping.  Looping simply means that you repeat the same block of code multiple times.  Since you are going through the code once, going back to the beginning and repeating it again, the direction of program execution looks like a loop (or a circle) which is why we call it looping.  We will introduce you to all of the looping methods available to you in this chapter.

== Program Flow ==

In general, program flow starts at the very top of the page and continues all the way down the page in the same way that you read a book.  All pages are executed this way in ASP and it makes the code very easy to follow until you get to conditional statements and looping constructs.

Because of the logical flow of the program, it is easy to trace through your program code and output debugging information to see what your script is doing as it gets processed by the ASP interpreter.  Through use of the '''Response.End''' statement, you can place breakpoints in your script to stop execution at specific points.  More about this will be discussed later.

One topic that will not be covered in this section is procedure and object method calls.  We will talk about these in later sections.

== Conditionals ==

A conditional statement is one where an expression is evaluated and based on the result one or more actions may be taken.  This allows you to check for a certain condition and take a specific action that is required when the condition is or is not met.

=== If-Then Statement ===

The &quot;If-Then&quot; statement is the most basic conditional statement.  When put on a single line, this statement says &quot;If the condition is met, then do this.&quot;  For example, we could test to see if someone is old enough to vote with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 If nAge &gt; 18 Then Response.Write &quot;Yes, you can vote!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You may optionally, create an '''If-Then''' statement that encloses a block of statements.  A block of statements means more than one statement grouped together.  In this case, the entire block of statements will be executed only when the condition is met.  We use indenting in this case to help us read the code and determine where the block starts and ends.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 If nAge &gt; 18 Then
     Response.Write &quot;Yes, you can vote!&quot;
     bCanVote = true
 End If
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see in this program block, the '''If Then''' statement defines the start of the program block while the '''End If''' statement defines the end of the program block.  The program block is indented to make it easier to match the start and end of the block.  All of the statements in this program block will only be executed if the conditional statement is met (nAge &gt; 18).  When it is not, nothing will be done.

=== If-Then-Else ===

The '''If Then''' statement is great, but what if you want to perform two different actions.  One action to be taken when the condition is met and one action to be taken when the condition is not met.  That is what the '''If Then Else''' statement was create to handle.  It basically says: &quot;If the condition is met, then do this, otherwise do this&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 If nAge &gt; 18 Then bCanVote = true Else bCanVote = False
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see from the example above, you can put the entire '''If Then Else''' statement in one line.  In many cases, you will want to avoid this since it tends to make the length of the line very long.  Instead, you will probably want to use the program block form like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 If nAge &gt; 18 Then
     Response.Write &quot;Yes, you can vote!&quot;
     bCanVote = true
 Else
     Response.Write &quot;No, you can not vote.&quot;
     bCanVote = false
 End If
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, only one of the two program blocks will be executed.  The first will be executed when the condition is met.  The second will be executed when the condition is not met.  So you can think of the '''If Then Else''' statement as saying &quot;one or the other but not both&quot;.

Although we are using more than one statement in the program blocks shown above, you could also put a single statement within each program block.  For debugging purposes, you can even have no statements at all within a program block.  This allows you to comment out all the statements in a program block and your script will still run no problem.

You will notice that in the conditional expression for the '''If Then''' statement, we did not have to enclose the condition with parentheses &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;.  You can always use parentheses for grouping expressions together but they are not required to enclose conditional statements.

=== Select Case ===

The '''If Then''' statements are great if you are just evaluating a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; condition.  But if you want to evaluate an expression other than a boolean and take some action based on the result, you will need another mechanism.  This is why the ASP language includes the '''Select Case''' statement.  This allows you to basically &quot;select&quot; from a list of many cases, the action to perform.

The cases for a '''Select Case''' are all literal primitive values.  You must have an &quot;exact match&quot; in order to match a &quot;case&quot;.  You may include more than one value to match, but you may not define ranges of values to match, nor may you define a pattern to match.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Select Case nAge
     Case 15, 16
         Response.Write &quot;You are almost old enough to vote&quot;
     Case 17
         Response.Write &quot;You might want to register to vote&quot;
     Case 18 
         Response.Write &quot;Yes, you can vote!&quot;
     Case Default
         Response.Write &quot;Catch-all for all other ages&quot;
 End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

This select statement is a little deceiving, because it will only tell you that you can vote if the age is 18 and only 18.  If the age is greater than 18, then none of the specific cases will be matched.  Instead, the optional catch-all case ('''Case Default''') will be executed when the age is greater than 18.

Of course, you don't need to include the '''Case Default''' if you don't need it.  By leaving it off, you are basically saying &quot;do nothing if an exact match for a case is not found&quot;.

You can use any expression for the '''Select Case''' as long as it evaluates to a primitive type.  You can not use an object expression because there is no such thing as an object literal to compare it to.  However, you can call an object method that returns a primitive type and use this as the expression.

In the example shown above, you can see that we are using the carriage return to separate the '''Case''' from the block to be executed.  There is no need to terminate this type of program block.  It is terminated by the instance of the next case or the '''End Select'''.  You may also put the case and the action to perform on the same line by using the colon (:) as a statement separator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 Select Case nAge
     Case 15, 16 : Response.Write &quot;You are almost old enough to vote&quot;
     Case 17 : Response.Write &quot;You might want to register to vote&quot;
     Case 18 : Response.Write &quot;Yes, you can vote!&quot;
     Case Default : Response.Write &quot;Catch-all for all other ages&quot;
 End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

== Looping Constructs ==

Looping constructs are used for repeating the same step over-and-over again.  There may be many reasons to use a loop.  In database-driven web applications, you will often use a loop to iterate over each record returned from a recordset.

=== For Next Loop ===

The &quot;for next&quot; loop allows you to repeat a block of code using an incremental counter.  The counter is initialized at the start of the loop and then incremented at the end of the loop.  At the start of each repetition, the counter is checked to see if it has exceeded the ending value.  This is best explained by using an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 For I = 1 To 10
     Response.Write &quot;I = &quot; &amp; I &amp; &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;
 Next
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, we have created a loop that is repeated 10 times.  We know it executes exactly ten times because you can read the statement as &quot;for every whole integer from 1 to 10, do this&quot;.

The variable &quot;I&quot; is initialized with a value of 1 and the first repetition of the program block (indented) is executed.  The output will be &quot;I = 1&quot;.  Don't worry about the &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot; part, this is just HTML code to create a line break on the web page.

The second time through the loop, the counter (I) is incremented and takes on a value of 2.  So the second line output by this block is &quot;I = 2&quot;.  This process repeats as I is incremented one at a time until the counter exceeds the end value.  So in this case, the last line printed will be &quot;I = 10&quot;.

In a more advanced case, we can change the way in which the index is incremented.  If we wanted the counter to increment by 2, we would write the '''For Next''' loop as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 For I = 1 To 10 Step 2
     Response.Write &quot;I = &quot; &amp; I &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
 Next
&lt;/source&gt;

The output of this code will be:

&lt;pre&gt;
 I = 1
 I = 3
 I = 5
 I = 7
 I = 9
&lt;/pre&gt;

This time we only get five values output by the loop.  This is because we are incrementing the counter by 2 instead of by 1 (the default.)  Notice that we do not have to finish on the ending value (10).  After incrementing the counter from 9 to 11, the loop checks to see if we have exceeded the ending value (10) and exits the loop.

You can also count backwards like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 For I = 10 To 1 Step -1
     Response.Write &quot;I = &quot; &amp; I &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
 Next
&lt;/source&gt;

And of course, you can substitute expressions and variables for the starting and ending values and even the amount to &quot;step through&quot; the loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 For I = nX + nY To YourFunc(nZ) Step nStep
     Response.Write &quot;I = &quot; &amp; I &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
 Next
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Do While ===

Another looping construct is the '''Do While''' loop which will repeat a block of program code as long as the condition is met.  This is kind of like the '''If Then''' conditional statement in that it expects a boolean expression.  Here is what it looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 I = 1
 bFound = False
 Do While I &lt; 10
     Response.Write &quot;I = &quot; &amp; I &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
     I = I + 1
 Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

What we have here is a loop that does exactly the same thing as the '''For Next''' example shown in the previous section.  Why would you want to use this construct instead of a &quot;for next&quot;?  The problem becomes obvious when it is not easy to determine how many repetitions of the loop you need to do.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 X = 239821.33
 Do While X &gt; 1
     Response.Write &quot;X = &quot; &amp; X &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
     X = X / 2
 Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, we do not know how many times we will have to divide the value of X by two until we end up with a value less than or equal to 1.  So we just use the '''Do While''' loop to handle the logic for us.


=== Do Until ===

Almost identical to the '''Do While''' looping construct is the '''Do Until'''.  It works exactly the same way except that it repeats the program block until the condition evaluates to &quot;true&quot;.  You could basically do the same thing with &quot;Do While&quot; by enclosing your expression with ''Not (expr)'', but the creators of ASP realized that the code would be cleaner using this more logical statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 X = 239821.33
 Do Until X &lt;= 1
     Response.Write &quot;X = &quot; &amp; X &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
     X = X / 2
 Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, we have created a loop that does exactly the same thing as our &quot;do while&quot;.  We just reversed the logic of the conditional statement and changed the keywords to '''Do Until'''.  In this case, it doesn't make the code that much cleaner to read.  But as we will see later, there are definite cases where you will want to use '''Do Until'''.

=== While ===

The '''While''' loop works exactly the same as the '''Do While''' except that it has a little shorter construct.  Please read the section on &quot;Do While&quot; to understand how this looping construct works.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
 X = 239821.33
 While X &gt; 1
     Response.Write &quot;X = &quot; &amp; X &amp; &quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;
     X = X / 2
 Wend
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike the &quot;Do&quot; loops, the '''While''' loop program block is terminated by the ''Wend'' statement. 
 
= Summary =

Active Server Pages has many different control flow statements to handle the execution of your ASP page.  The conditional statements are: '''If Then''', '''If Then Else''' and '''Select Case'''.  The looping constructs are '''For Next''', '''Do While''', '''Do Until''' and '''While'''. Conditional expressions in ASP do not need to be enclosed in parentheses (&quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;).

'''For Next''' loops manipulate a counter and repeat the program block until the counter exceeds the ending value.  '''Do While''', '''Do Until''' and '''While''' loops repeat based on the evaluation of a boolean expression (meaning an expression resulting in the value of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;).

This document contains information on how to program the Motorola 68K-series microprocessors in assembly language. 

The Motorola 68K series of microprocessors was used by many manufacturers:
* Apple in their Macintosh computers until they switched to the PowerPC series of microprocessors, and in their LaserWriter printers until they switched to the AMD 29000 series of microprocessors.
* The Commodore Amiga
* Sun, HP, SGI and other 80s Unix workstations before their switch to RISC processors like SPARC, PA-RISC and MIPS.
* Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon line of personal computers.
* Sinclair for the Sinclair QL (which was also re-badged as the ICL one-per-desk).
* NeXT before they became a software-only company.
* Palm in their handheld PDAs until they switched to the ARM series of microprocessors. Almost all applications run in emulated 68K mode, however.
* The 680x0 was popular in arcade machines until the middle of the 1990s. It can be found in many Capcom games.
* The Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in the U.S.) used a 68000 as its main processor.  Its successor, the Saturn, used one as its sound processor.
* The Atari Jaguar had a 68000 as the central CPU among many dedicated processors.
* The Texas Instruments Calculators TI-89, TI-92, Voyage 200 and TI-89 Titanium
* Many embedded computer systems use 68K family microprocessors, often running real-time operating systems.

One thing to note is that the PowerPC is ''not'' binary compatible with the 68K processor. Their assembly languages are completely different.
However, Apple has written an emulator (in [[PowerPC Assembly|PowerPC assembly]] language) which allows PowerPC microprocessors to interpret machine language code written for 68K microprocessors, albeit with a substantial performance decrease versus native PowerPC machine language.

The Motorola 68K is a CISC-based CPU that operates on memory organized in a Big-Endian fashion.

{{wikipediapar||68k}}

==Registers==
With the exception of the 16-bit status register, all 68000 registers are 32-bits wide.

There are eight data registers: d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7. These are intended to hold numbers that will have various mathematical and logical operations performed on them.

There are seven address registers: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, and a6.  These are typically used as pointers.

There is one active stack pointer: SP, also called a7.
Normally the processor is in user mode.
In user mode, SP refers to the User Stack Pointer (USP) register.
(During interrupts, the active stack pointer SP is another register called the Interrupt Stack Pointer or the System Stack Pointer. The 68020 and higher processors have a third register called the Master Stack Pointer. Neither the ISP nor the MSP can be accessed in user mode).

The 68K includes special addressing modes that make it easy to manipulate a data stack structure using ''any'' address register.

The Program Counter (PC) points to the current instruction. On the 68000, only the lower 24 bits output to any pins, giving a maximum addressing range of 16MiB. The Program Counter is changed automatically when a new instruction is loaded or when a BRA, Bcc, BSR, JMP, Jcc, JSR, RTS, or RTE instruction is used. It can also be used as a pointer in PC relative addressing modes.

The Condition Code Register (CCR) consists of the lower byte of the Status Register (SR). Only the lower byte is accessible in user mode, and of this, only the first five bits are useful. In supervisor mode, the entire 16-bit register is accessible. The register looks like this:

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
|15||14||13||12||11||10||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||1||0
|-
|T1||T0||S||M||0||I2||I1||I0||0||0||0||X||N||Z||V||C
|}

Here's the decoded register contents:
{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!Bit||Description
|-
| C
| Carry
|-
| V
| Overflow
|-
| Z
| Zero
|-
| N
| Negative
|-
| X
| Extend
|-
| I0
| Interrupt priority mask bit 1
|-
| I1
| Interrupt priority mask bit 2
|-
| I2
| Interrupt priority mask bit 3
|-
| M
| Master/Interrupt switch. Determines which stack mode to use if S is set. If M is clear, SP refers to ISP, else SP refers to MSP. This bit is always clear on processor models lower than 68020.
|-
| S
| Supervisor Mode flag. If clear, SP refers to USP. If set, look at M to determine what stack SP points to.
|-
| T0
| Trace bit 1. If set, trace on change of program flow. This bit is always cleared on processor models lower than 68020.
|-
| T1
| Trace bit 2. If set, trace is allowed on any instruction. '''DO NOT SET BOTH TRACE BITS AT THE SAME TIME!'''
|}

==Addressing Modes==
n is a number between 0 and 7 denoting which register to use.

===Immediate addressing with data registers===
Assembler syntax
* Dn
Directly operate on the contents of a data register. Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
MOVE.L D1,D0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Copies the contents of D1 to D0. When the instruction is executed, both registers will contain the same information. When moving a byte or a word, the upper part of the register will remain unchanged.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
              ;lets assume
              ;D0=FFFFFFFF D1=01234567
 MOVE.B D1,D0 ;copies a Byte from source
              ;D0=FFFFFF67 D1=01234567
....
              ;lets assume
              ;D0=FFFFFFFF D1=01234567
 MOVE.W D1,D0 ;copies a Word from source
              ;D0=FFFF4567 D1=01234567
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Immediate addressing with address registers===
Assembler syntax:
* An
Directly operate on the contents of an address register.Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
MOVE.L A1,D0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Copies whole A1 to D0. After the instruction, both registers contain the same information. When transferring with ADDRESS registers you must use word or longword. When a word is transferred to an address register, bit 15 (the sign bit) will be copied through the whole upper word (bit 16-31). If it wasn't so, a negative number would become positive.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
              ;lets assume
              ;D0=FFFFFFFF A1=01234567
 MOVE.W A1,D0 ;copies a Word from source
              ;D0=FFFF4567 A1=01234567
....
              ;lets assume
              ;D0=01234567 A1=FFFFFFFF
 MOVE.W D0,A1 ;copies a Word from source
              ;D0=01234567 A1=00004567
              ; sign to A1, changed
....
              ;lets assume
              ;D0=0000FFFF A1=00000000
 MOVE.W D0,A1 ;copies a Word from source
              ;D0=0000FFFF A1=FFFFFFFF
              ; sign to A1, changed
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Indirect addressing===
Assembler syntax:
* (An)
Operate on the memory location pointed to by An. For example:
 lea $1234,A1
 move.w D0,(A1)
will move the first 16 bits of D0 into the word starting at $1234.
Another example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
MOVE.L (A0),D0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Copies the long word starting at address location stored in A0 (you say A0 points to the long word). If you refer to a word or a long word, the address in the address register must be an EVEN number. Take care with this!!!
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                ;lets assume
                ;D0=FFFFFFFF A1=00001000
                ;mem.addr. $1000=01234567
 MOVE.L (A1),D0 ;copies Long word starting at memory address stored in A1, to D0
                ;D0=01234567 A1=00001000
                ;mem.addr. $1000=01234567
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Indirect addressing with postincrement===
Assembler syntax:
* (An)+
Same as indirect addressing, but An will be increased by the size of the operation after the instruction is executed. The only exception is byte operations on A7 - this register must point to an even address, so it will always increment by at least 2.
Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
MOVE.L (A1)+,D0 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Copies to D0 the longword which A1 points, and increases A1 with 4 (because of Long).
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                 ;lets assume
                 ;D0=FFFFFFFF A1=00001000
                 ;mem.addr. $1000=01234567
 MOVE.L (A1)+,D0 ;copies the Long word starting at address stored in A1, to D0
                 ;then increment A1 by 4
                 ;D0=01234567 A1=00001004
                 ;mem.addr. $1000=01234567
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Indirect addressing with predecrement===
Assembler syntax:
* -(An)
Same as indirect addressing, but An will be decrememted by the size of the operation BEFORE the instruction is executed. The only exception is byte operations on A7 - this register must point to an even address, so it will always decrement by at least 2. Note that there is no postdecrement or preincrement addressing mode.
Example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
MOVE.L -(A0),D2 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
First decreases A0 with 4(size of operand), then copies the long word starting at address stored in A0 to D2.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
                 ;lets assume
                 ;D0=FFFFFFFF A1=000010A8
                 ;mem.addr. $10A4=01234567
 MOVE.L -(A1),D0 ;first decrements A1 by 4, A1=000010A4
                 ;then copies the Long word starting at address stored in A1, to D0
                 ;D0=01234567
                 ;mem.addr. $10A4=01234567
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Indirect addressing with shifting===
Assembler syntax: 
* x(An)
* (x)(An)
* (x,An) 
Operate on the location pointed to by x + An, where x is a 16-bit immediate value. All listed syntaxes are equivalent, but some assemblers won't accept them all.

===Indirect addressing with index===
Assembler syntax:
* x(An,Dn.W)
* x(An,Dn.L)
* x(An,An.W)
* x(An,An.L)
* (x)(An,Dn.W)
* (x)(An,Dn.L)
* (x)(An,An.W)
* (x)(An,An.L)
* (x,An,Dn.W)
* (x,An,Dn.L)
* (x,An,An.W)
* (x,An,An.L)
Same as above, but another register will also be added. Not all assemblers will take all listed syntaxes.

===Absolute near addressing===
Assembler syntax:
* (xxx).W
* xxx.W
Operate on the location pointed to by xxx. xxx is sign-extended by the assembler. You can write this either with or without the parentheses, and most assemblers can take either one. Which you choose is largely a matter of personal preference, but most people find (xxx).W easier to read.

===Absolute far addressing===
Assembler syntax:
* (xxx).L
* xxx.L
Operate on the location pointed to by xxx. xxx is sign-extended by the assembler. Some instructions only accept one or the other of near or far absolute addresses, thus the separation. Like absolute near, you can include the parentheses at your discretion.

===Program Counter with displacement===
Assembler syntax:
* x(PC)
* (x)(PC)
* (x,PC)
Operate on the memory value at x + PC, where x is a 16-bit immediate value. Note that PC is the address of the extension word that x is stored in (right after the instruction's word). All syntaxes are equivalent, but some assemblers won't take them all.

===Program counter with index===
Assembler syntax:
* x(PC,Dn.W)
* x(PC,Dn.L)
* x(PC,An.W)
* x(PC,An.L)
* (x)(PC,Dn.W)
* (x)(PC,Dn.L)
* (x)(PC,An.W)
* (x)(PC,An.L)
* (x,PC,Dn.W)
* (x,PC,Dn.L)
* (x,PC,An.W)
* (x,PC,An.L)
Like PC with displacement, but another register is added as well. Some assemblers won't take certain syntaxes.

===Immediate addressing===
Assembler syntax:
* #xxx
Operate on xxx.

===Status Register addressing===
Assembler syntax:
* SR
* CCR
SR is the entire status register, including the system byte. CCR is just the flags. Other than that, I don't know how this works. SR is only available in supervisor mode.

The only instructions that are allowed to use this addressing mode are: MOVE, ANDI (AND immediate), EORI (exclusive OR immediate) and ORI (OR immediate) known as: MOVE to/from CCR, MOVE to/from SR, ANDI to CCR, ORI to CCR, EORI to CCR, ANDI to SR, ORI to SR, EORI to SR.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
           ;Example ORI to CCR
           ;lets assume CCR=$00
ORI #5,CCR ;sets both the carryflag (C) and the zeroflag (Z)
           ;CCR = $05 -&gt; 00000101
           ;most assemblers recognize both SR and CCR
           ;so you don't have to specify the length of operand.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conditional tests==
Wherever you see &quot;cc&quot; in an instruction, you should replace it with the appropriate conditional test code. Refer to this table for what each test does.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;As a compromise, most 68k compilers use BRA (BRanch Always) instruction for this value of &quot;cc&quot; field.

==Labels==
Labels are simply names for lines. You can have as many labels as you want. Typically, there are only a few places you'll want to refer to, for example the starting points of functions, loop starts and loop ends, and certain data storage locations.

The assembler handles labels as aliases for numbers. When it encounters one, it assigns it the current value of the assembler's PC. (I will refer to this as &quot;declaring&quot; the label.) This label can then be used as an operand anywhere a number can. They are usually used in Jcc or Bcc instructions.

Note that you can reference labels before they're actually declared. This is known as ''forward referencing'', and is handled differently depending on the assembler. Usually, it just uses a known safe value (like the current PC), flags the location, and makes a second pass to substitute the real value. This may change the size of the label, in which case a third pass will be needed, and so on. Some assemblers require you to explicitly define the size of a jump/branch to keep from having to make a third pass. The assembler you use may have different behavior.

Labels and storage space:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
MYDATA:
ds.b 16              ; Declare 16 bytes of space, MYDATA label refers to this location.
global Main          ; Inform assembler that the Main label should be exported (made visible to code not in this file)

Main:                ; Label for the main function
MOVEA.L #MYDATA, A0  ; Set address register A0 to refer to MYDATA space
MOVE.B #0, 0(A0)     ; Copy 0 into the first byte of MYDATA
MOVE.B #1, 1(A0)     ; Copy 1 into the second byte of MYDATA
rts                  ; Return
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


==Instruction Set==
The 68K instruction set is very orthogonal. Most instructions can operate on all data sizes, and very few are restricted to less than three addressing modes. 68K instructions are rather slow, but they do a lot more than instructions for the Z80 or x86 processors.

Detailed descriptions of every instruction in the MC68000 family can be found in the Programmer's Reference Manual. See External Links below.

 Insert instruction table here - this version will probably have far more
 columns than the tables that were here.

This book covers techniques for the design and analysis of algorithms.
The algorithmic techniques covered include: divide and conquer, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and hill-climbing.

Any solvable problem generally has at least one algorithm of each of the following types:

# the obvious way;
# the methodical way;
# the clever way; and
# the miraculous way.

On the first and most basic level, the &quot;obvious&quot; solution might try to exhaustively search for the answer. Intuitively, the obvious solution is the one that comes easily if you're familiar with a programming language and the basic problem solving techniques.

The second level is the methodical level and is the heart of this book: after understanding the material presented here you should be able to methodically turn most obvious algorithms into better performing algorithms.

The third level, the clever level, requires more understanding of the elements involved in the problem and their properties or even a reformulation of the algorithm (e.g., numerical algorithms exploit mathematical properties that are not obvious). A clever algorithm may be hard to understand by being non-obvious that it is correct, or it may be hard to understand that it actually runs faster than what it would seem to require.

The fourth and final level of an algorithmic solution is the miraculous level: this is reserved for the rare cases where a breakthrough results in a highly non-intuitive solution.

Naturally, all of these four levels are relative, and some clever algorithms are covered in this book as well, in addition to the methodical techniques. Let's begin.

== Prerequisites ==
To understand the material presented in this book you need to know a programming language well enough to translate the pseudocode in this book into a working solution. You also need to know the basics about the following data structures: arrays, stacks, queues, linked-lists, trees, heaps (also called priority queues), disjoint sets, and graphs.

Additionally, you should know some basic algorithms like binary search, a sorting algorithm (merge sort, heap sort, insertion sort, or others), and breadth-first or depth-first search.

If you are unfamiliar with any of these prerequisites you should review the material in the ''[[Computer Science:Data Structures|Data Structures]]'' book first.

== When is Efficiency Important? ==
Not every problem requires the most efficient solution available. For our purposes, the term efficient is concerned with the time and/or space needed to perform the task. When either time or space is abundant and cheap, it may not be worth it to pay a programmer to spend a day or so working to make a program faster.

However, here are some cases where efficiency matters:

* When resources are limited, a change in algorithms could create great savings and allow limited machines (like cell phones, embedded systems, and sensor networks) to be stretched to the frontier of possibility.

* When the data is large a more efficient solution can mean the difference between a task finishing in two days versus two weeks. Examples include physics, genetics, web searches, massive online stores, and network traffic analysis.

* Real time applications: the term &quot;real time applications&quot; actually refers to computations that give time guarantees, versus meaning &quot;fast.&quot; However, the quality can be increased further by choosing the appropriate algorithm.

* Computationally expensive jobs, like fluid dynamics, partial differential equations, VLSI design, and cryptanalysis can sometimes only be considered when the solution is found efficiently enough.

* When a subroutine is common and frequently used, time spent on a more efficient implementation can result in benefits for every application that uses the subroutine. Examples include sorting, searching, pseudorandom number generation, kernel operations (not to be confused with the operating system kernel), database queries, and graphics.

In short, it's important to save time when you do not have any time to spare.

When is efficiency unimportant? Examples of these cases include prototypes that are used only a few times, cases where the input is small, when simplicity and ease of maintenance is more important, when the area concerned is not the bottle neck, or when there's another process or area in the code that would benefit far more from efficient design and attention to the algorithm(s).

== Inventing an Algorithm ==

Because we assume you have some knowledge of a programming language, let's start with how we translate an idea into an algorithm. Suppose you want to write a function that will take a string as input and output the string in lowercase:

 // ''tolower -- translates all alphabetic, uppercase characters in str to lowercase''
 function '''tolower'''(string ''str''): string

What first comes to your mind when you think about solving this problem? Perhaps these two considerations crossed your mind:
# Every character in ''str'' needs to be looked at
# A routine for converting a single character to lower case is required
The first point is &quot;obvious&quot; because a character that needs to be converted might appear anywhere in the string. The second point follows from the first because, once we consider each character, we need to do something with it. There are many ways of writing the '''tolower''' function for characters:

 function '''tolower'''(character ''c''): character

There are several ways to implement this function, including:

* look ''c'' up in a table -- a character indexed array of characters that holds the lowercase version of each character. 

* check if ''c'' is in the range 'A' &amp;le; ''c'' &amp;le; 'Z', and then add a numerical offset to it.

These techniques depend upon the character encoding.
(As an issue of separation of concerns, perhaps the table solution is stronger because it's clearer you only need to change one part of the code.)

However such a subroutine is implemented, once we have it, the implementation of our original problem comes immediately:

 // ''tolower -- translates all alphabetic, uppercase characters in str to lowercase''
 function '''tolower'''(string ''str''): string
   let ''result'' := &quot;&quot;
   for-each ''c'' in ''str'':
     ''result''.append('''tolower'''(''c''))
   repeat
   return ''result''
 end
{{Algorithms/Sample|[[Ada_Programming/Algorithms#To_Lower|Ada]]}}

The loop is the result of our ability to translate &quot;every character needs to be looked at&quot; into our native programming language.
It became obvious that the '''tolower''' subroutine call should be in the loop's body. The final step required to bring the high-level task into an implementation was deciding how to build the resulting string. Here, we chose to start with the empty string and append characters to the end of it.

Now suppose you want to write a function for comparing two strings that tests if they are equal, ignoring case:

 // ''equal-ignore-case -- returns true if s and t are equal, ignoring case''
 function '''equal-ignore-case'''(string ''s'', string ''t''): boolean

These ideas might come to mind:
# Every character in strings ''s'' and ''t'' will have to be looked at
# A single loop iterating through both might accomplish this
# But such a loop should be careful that the strings are of equal length first
# If the strings aren't the same length, then they cannot be equal because the consideration of ignoring case doesn't affect how long the string is
# A tolower subroutine for characters can be used again, and only the lowercase versions will be compared

These ideas come from familiarity both with strings and with the looping and conditional constructs in your language. The function you thought of may have looked something like this:

 // ''equal-ignore-case -- returns true if s or t are equal, ignoring case''
 function '''equal-ignore-case'''(string ''s''[1..''n''], string ''t''[1..''m'']): boolean
   if ''n'' != ''m'':
     return false               ''\if they aren't the same length, they aren't equal\''
   fi
   
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     if '''tolower'''(''s''[''i'']) != '''tolower'''(''t''[''i'']):
       return false
     fi
   repeat
   return true
 end
{{Algorithms/Sample|[[Ada_Programming/Algorithms#Equal_Ignore_Case|Ada]]}}

Or, if you thought of the problem in terms of functional decomposition instead of iterations, you might have thought of a function more like this:

 // ''equal-ignore-case -- returns true if s or t are equal, ignoring case''
 function '''equal-ignore-case'''(string ''s'', string ''t''): boolean
   return '''tolower'''(''s'').equals('''tolower'''(''t''))
 end

Alternatively, you may feel neither of these solutions is efficient enough, and you would prefer an algorithm that only ever made one pass of ''s'' or ''t''. The above two implementations each require two-passes: the first version computes the lengths and then compares each character, while the second version computes the lowercase versions of the string and then compares the results to each other. (Note that for a pair of strings, it is also possible to have the length precomputed to avoid the second pass, but that can have its own drawbacks at times.) You could imagine how similar routines can be written to test string equality that not only ignore case, but also ignore accents.

Already you might be getting the spirit of the pseudocode in this book. The pseudocode language is not meant to be a real programming language: it abstracts away details that you would have to contend with in any language. For example, the language doesn't assume generic types or dynamic versus static types: the idea is that it should be clear what is intended and it should not be too hard to convert it to your native language. (However, in doing so, you might have to make some design decisions that limit the implementation to one particular type or form of data.)

There was nothing special about the techniques we used so far to solve these simple string problems: such techniques are perhaps already in your toolbox, and you may have found better or more elegant ways of expressing the solutions in your programming language of choice. In this book, we explore general algorithmic techniques to expand your toolbox even further. Taking a naive algorithm and making it more efficient might not come so immediately, but after understanding the material in this book you should be able to methodically apply different solutions, and, most importantly, you will be able to ask yourself more questions about your programs. Asking questions can be just as important as answering questions, because asking the right question can help you reformulate the problem and think outside of the box.

== Understanding an Algorithm ==
Computer programmers need an excellent ability to reason with multiple-layered abstractions. For example, consider the following code:

 function '''foo'''(integer ''a''):
   if (''a'' / 2) * 2 == ''a'':
      print &quot;The value &quot; ''a'' &quot; is even.&quot;
   fi
 end

To understand this example, you need to know that integer division uses truncation and therefore when the if-condition is true then the least-significant bit in ''a'' is zero (which means that ''a'' must be even). Additionally, the code uses a string printing API and is itself the definition of a function to be used by different modules. Depending on the programming task, you may think on the layer of hardware, on down to the level of processor branch-prediction or the cache.

Often an understanding of binary is crucial, but many modern languages have abstractions far enough away &quot;from the hardware&quot; that these lower-levels are not necessary. Somewhere the abstraction stops: most programmers don't need to think about logic gates, nor is the physics of electronics necessary. Nevertheless, an essential part of programming is multiple-layer thinking.

But stepping away from computer programs toward algorithms requires another layer: mathematics. A program may exploit properties of binary representations. An algorithm can exploit properties of set theory or other mathematical constructs. Just as binary itself is not explicit in a program, the mathematical properties used in an algorithm are not explicit.

Typically, when an algorithm is introduced, a discussion (separate from the code) is needed to explain the mathematics used by the algorithm. For example, to really understand a greedy algorithm (such as Dijkstra's algorithm) you should understand the mathematical properties that show how the greedy strategy is valid for all cases. In a way, you can think of the mathematics as its own kind of subroutine that the algorithm invokes. But this &quot;subroutine&quot; is not present in the code because there's nothing to call. As you read this book try to think about mathematics as an implicit subroutine.

== Overview of the Techniques ==
The techniques this book covers are highlighted in the following overview.

* '''Divide and Conquer''': Many problems, particularly when the input is given in an array, can be solved by cutting the problem into smaller pieces (''divide''), solving the smaller parts recursively  (''conquer''), and then combining the solutions into a single result. Examples include the merge sort and quicksort algorithms.

* '''Randomization''': Increasingly, randomization techniques are important for many applications. This chapter presents some classical algorithms that make use of random numbers.

* '''Backtracking''': Almost any problem can be cast in some form as a backtracking algorithm. In backtracking, you consider all possible choices to solve a problem and recursively solve subproblems under the assumption that the choice is taken. The set of recursive calls generates a tree in which  each set of choices in the tree is considered consecutively.  Consequently, if a solution exists, it will eventually be found.&lt;p&gt;Backtracking is generally an inefficient, brute-force technique, but there are optimizations that can be performed to reduce both the depth of the tree and the number of branches. The technique is called backtracking because after one leaf of the tree is visited, the algorithm will go back up the call stack (undoing choices that didn't lead to success), and then proceed down some other branch. To be solved with backtracking techniques, a problem needs to have some form of &quot;self-similarity,&quot; that is, smaller instances of the problem (after a choice has been made) must resemble the original problem. Usually, problems can be generalized to become self-similar.

* '''Dynamic Programming''': Dynamic programming is an optimization technique for backtracking algorithms. When subproblems need to be solved repeatedly (i.e., when there are many duplicate branches in the backtracking algorithm) time can be saved by solving all of the subproblems first (bottom-up, from smallest to largest) and storing the solution to each subproblem in a table. Thus, each subproblem is only visited and solved once instead of repeatedly. The &quot;programming&quot; in this technique's name comes from programming in the sense of writing things down in a table; for example, television programming is making a table of what shows will be broadcast when.

* '''Greedy Algorithms''': A greedy algorithm can be useful when enough information is known about possible choices that &quot;the best&quot; choice can be determined without considering all possible choices. Typically, greedy algorithms are not challenging to write, but they are difficult to prove correct.

* '''Hill Climbing''': The final technique we explore is hill climbing. The basic idea is to start with a poor solution to a problem, and then repeatedly apply optimizations to that solution until it becomes optimal or meets some other requirement. An important case of hill climbing is network flow. Despite the name, network flow is useful for many problems that describe relationships, so it's not just for computer networks. Many matching problems can be solved using network flow.

Before we begin learning algorithmic techniques, we take a detour to give ourselves some necessary mathematical tools. First, we cover mathematical definitions of terms that are used later on in the book. By expanding your mathematical vocabulary you can be more precise and you can state or formulate problems more simply. Following that, we cover techniques for analysing the running time of an algorithm. After each major algorithm covered in this book we give an analysis of its running time as well as a proof of its correctness



== Asymptotic Notation ==
In addition to correctness another important characteristic of a useful algorithm is its time and memory consumption. Time and memory are both valuable resources and there are important differences (even when both are abundant) in how we can use them.

How can you measure resource consumption? One way is to create a function that describes the usage in terms of some characteristic of the input. One commonly used characteristic of an input dataset is its size. For example, suppose an algorithm takes an input as an array of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; integers. We can describe the time this algorithm takes as a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; written in terms of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we might write:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^2 + 3n + 14&lt;/math&gt;

where the value of &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is some unit of time (in this discussion the main focus will be on time, but we could do the same for memory consumption). Rarely are the units of time actually in seconds, because that would depend on the machine itself, the system it's running, and its load. Instead, the units of time typically used are in terms of the number of some fundamental operation performed. For example, some fundamental operations we might care about are: the number of additions or multiplications needed; the number of element comparisons; the number of memory-location swaps performed; or the raw number of machine instructions executed. In general we might just refer to these fundamental operations performed as steps taken.

Is this a good approach to determine an algorithm's resource consumption? Yes and no. When two different algorithms are similar in time consumption a precise function might help to determine which algorithm is faster under given conditions. But in many cases it is either difficult or impossible to calculate an analytical description of the exact number of operations needed, especially when the algorithm performs operations conditionally on the values of its input. Instead, what really is important is not the precise time required to complete the function, but rather the degree that resource consumption changes depending on its inputs. Concretely, consider these two functions, representing the computation time required for each size of input dataset:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^3-12n^2+20n+110&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(n) = n^3+n^2+5n+5&lt;/math&gt;

They look quite different, but how do they behave? Let's look at a few plots of the function (&lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is in red, &lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; in blue):

{| border = 0
| [[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot1.png|frame|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 5|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 5]] || [[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot2.png|frame|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 15|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 15]]
|-
| [[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot3.png|frame|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 100|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 100]] || [[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot4.png|frame|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 1000|Plot of f and g, in range 0 to 1000]]&lt;br&gt;
|}

In the first, very-limited plot the curves appear somewhat different. In the second plot they start going in sort of the same way, in the third there is only a very small difference, and at last they are virtually identical. In fact, they approach &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt;, the dominant term. As n gets larger, the other terms become much less significant in comparison to n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

As you can see, modifying a polynomial-time algorithm's low-order coefficients doesn't help much. What really matters is the highest-order coefficient. This is why we've adopted a notation for this kind of analysis. We say that:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^3-12n^2+20n+110 = O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt;

We ignore the low-order terms. We can say that:

:&lt;math&gt;O(\log {n}) \le O(\sqrt{n}) \le O(n) \le O(n \log {n}) \le O(n^2) \le O(n^3) \le O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us a way to more easily compare algorithms with each other. Running an insertion sort on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements takes steps on the order of &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Merge sort sorts in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log {n})&lt;/math&gt; steps. Therefore, once the input dataset is large enough, merge sort is faster than insertion sort.

In general, we write

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;

when

:&lt;math&gt;\exists c&gt;0, \exists n_0&gt; 0, \forall n\ge n_{0}: 0\le f(n)\le c\cdot g(n).&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;f(n) = O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if there exists some constants &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is positive and less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;c g(n)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Note that the equal sign used in this notation describes a relationship between &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; instead of reflecting a true equality. In light of this, some define Big-O in terms of a set, stating that:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)\in O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;

when

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)\in \{f(n) : \exists c&gt;0, \exists n_0&gt; 0, \forall n\ge n_0: 0\le f(n)\le c\cdot g(n)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Big-O notation is only an upper bound; these two are both true:

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 = O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n^4 = O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt;

If we use the equal sign as an equality we can get very strange results, such as:

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 = n^4&lt;/math&gt;

which is obviously nonsense. This is why the set-definition is handy. You can avoid these things by thinking of the equal sign as a one-way equality, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 = O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt;

does not imply

:&lt;math&gt;O(n^4) = n^3&lt;/math&gt;

Always keep the O on the right hand side.

=== Big Omega ===
Sometimes, we want more than an upper bound on the behavior of a certain function. Big Omega provides a lower bound. In general, we say that

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \Omega(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;

when

:&lt;math&gt;\exists c&gt;0, \exists n_0&gt; 0, \forall n\ge n_{0}: 0\le c\cdot g(n)\le f(n).&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(n) = \Omega(g(n))&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist constants c and n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that for all n&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; f(n) is positive and '''greater''' than or equal to cg(n).

So, for example, we can say that

:&lt;math&gt;n^2-2n = \Omega(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;,  (c=1/2, n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=4) or
:&lt;math&gt;n^2-2n = \Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, (c=1, n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=3),

but it is false to claim that

:&lt;math&gt;n^2-2n = \Omega(n^3).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Big Theta ===
When a given function is both O(g(n)) and &amp;Omega;(g(n)), we say it is &amp;Theta;(g(n)), and we have a tight bound on the function. A function f(n) is &amp;Theta;(g(n)) when

:&lt;math&gt;\exists c_1&gt;0, \exists c_2&gt;0, \exists n_0&gt; 0, \forall n\ge n_0 : 0\le c_1\cdot g(n)\le f(n)\le c_2\cdot g(n),&lt;/math&gt;

but most of the time, when we're trying to prove that a given &lt;math&gt;f(n) = \Theta(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;, instead of using this definition, we just show that it is both O(g(n)) and &amp;Omega;(g(n)).

=== Little-O and Omega ===
When the asymptotic bound is not tight, we can express this by saying that &lt;math&gt;f(n) = o(g(n))&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f(n) = \omega(g(n)).&lt;/math&gt; The definitions are:

:f(n) is o(g(n)) iff &lt;math&gt;\forall c&gt;0, \exists n_0&gt; 0, \forall n\ge n_0: 0\le f(n) &lt; c\cdot g(n)&lt;/math&gt; and
:f(n) is &amp;omega;(g(n)) iff &lt;math&gt;\forall c&gt;0, \exists n_0&gt; 0, \forall n\ge n_0: 0\le c\cdot g(n) &lt; f(n).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that a function f is in o(g(n)) when for any coefficient of g, g eventually gets larger than f, while for O(g(n)), there only has to exist a single coefficient for which g eventually gets at least as big as f.

[TODO: define what T(n,m) = O(f(n,m)) means. That is, when the running time of an algorithm has two dependent variables. Ex, a graph with n nodes and m edges. It's important to get the quantifiers correct!]

== Algorithm Analysis: Solving Recurrence Equations ==
Merge sort of n elements: &lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + c(n)&lt;/math&gt;  This describes one iteration of the merge sort: the problem space &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to two halves (&lt;math&gt;2*T(n/2)&lt;/math&gt;), and then merged back together at the end of all the recursive calls (&lt;math&gt;c(n)&lt;/math&gt;). This notation system is the bread and butter of algorithm analysis, so get used to it.  

There are some theorems you can use to estimate the big Oh time for a function if its recurrence equation fits a certain pattern.

[TODO: write this section]

=== Substitution method ===
Formulate a guess about the big Oh time of your equation.  Then use proof by induction to prove the guess is correct.

[TODO: write this section]

=== Summations ===
[TODO: show the closed forms of commonly needed summations and prove them]

=== Draw the Tree and Table ===
This is really just a way of getting an intelligent guess.  You still have to go back to the substitution method in order to prove the big Oh time.

[TODO: write this section]

=== The Master Theorem ===
Consider a recurrence equation that fits the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = a T\left({\frac{n}{b}}\right) + O(n^k)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''a'' &amp;ge; 1, ''b'' &gt; 1 and ''k'' &amp;ge; 0. Here, ''a'' is the number of recursive calls made per call to the function, ''n'' is the input size, ''b'' is how much smaller the input gets, and ''k'' is the polynomial order of an operation that occurs each time the function is called (except for the base cases). For example, in the merge sort algorithm covered later, we have

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2 T\left({\frac{n}{2}}\right) + O(n)&lt;/math&gt;

because two subproblems are called for each non-base case iteration, and the size of the array is divided in half each time. The &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; at the end is the &quot;conquer&quot; part of this divide and conquer algorithm: it takes linear time to merge the results from the two recursive calls into the final result.

Thinking of the recursive calls of ''T'' as forming a tree, there are three possible cases to determine where most of the algorithm is spending its time (&quot;most&quot; in this sense is concerned with its asymptotic behaviour):

# the tree can be '''top heavy''', and most time is spent during the initial calls near the root;
# the tree can have a '''steady state''', where time is spread evenly; or
# the tree can be '''bottom heavy''', and most time is spent in the calls near the leaves

Depending upon which of these three states the tree is in ''T'' will have different complexities:

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width: 80%;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''The Master Theorem'''&lt;br&gt;
Given &lt;math&gt;T(n) = a T\left({\frac{n}{b}}\right) + O(n^k)&lt;/math&gt; for ''a'' &amp;ge; 1, ''b'' &gt; 1 and ''k'' &amp;ge; 0:
* If &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b^k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T(n) = O(n^k)\ &lt;/math&gt; (top heavy)
* If &lt;math&gt;a = b^k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T(n) = O(n^k\cdot \log n)&lt;/math&gt; (steady state)
* If &lt;math&gt;a &gt; b^k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T(n) = O(n^{\log_b a})&lt;/math&gt; (bottom heavy)
&lt;/div&gt;

For the merge sort example above, where

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2 T\left({\frac{n}{2}}\right) + O(n)&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;a=2, b=2, k=1\implies b^k = 2&lt;/math&gt;

thus, &lt;math&gt;a = b^k&lt;/math&gt; and so this is also in the &quot;steady state&quot;: By the master theorem, the complexity of merge sort is thus

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = O(n^1\log n) = O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Amortized Analysis ==
[Start with an adjacency list representation of a graph and show two nested for loops: one for each node n, and nested inside that one loop for each edge e. If there are n nodes and m edges, this could lead you to say the loop takes O(nm) time. However, only once could the innerloop take that long, and a tighter bound is O(n+m).]

The first major algorithmic technique we cover is '''divide and conquer'''. Part of the trick of making a good divide and conquer algorithm is determining how a given problem could be separated into two or more similar, but smaller, subproblems. More generally, when we are creating a divide and conquer algorithm we will take the following steps:

{| WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | '''Divide and Conquer Methodology'''&lt;br&gt;
# Given a problem, identify a small number of significantly smaller subproblems of the same type
# Solve each subproblem recursively (the smallest possible size of a subproblem is a base-case)
# Combine these solutions into a solution for the main problem
|}

The first algorithm we'll present using this methodology is the merge sort.

== Merge Sort == 
The problem that '''merge sort''' solves is general sorting: given an unordered array of elements that have a total ordering, create an array that has the same elements sorted. More precisely, for an array ''a'' with indexes 1 through ''n'', if the condition

:for all ''i'', ''j'' such that 1 &amp;le; ''i'' &lt; ''j'' &amp;le; ''n'' then ''a''[''i''] &amp;le; ''a''[''j'']

holds, then ''a'' is said to be '''sorted'''.  Here is the interface:

 ''// sort -- returns a sorted copy of array a''
 function '''sort'''(array ''a''): array

Following the divide and conquer methodology, how can ''a'' be broken up into smaller subproblems? Because ''a'' is an array of ''n'' elements, we might want to start by breaking the array into two arrays of size ''n''/2 elements. These smaller arrays will also be unsorted and it is meaningful to sort these smaller problems; thus we can consider these smaller arrays &quot;similar&quot;. Ignoring the base case for a moment, this reduces the problem into a different one: Given two sorted arrays, how can they be combined to form a single sorted array that contains all the elements of both given arrays:

 ''// merge -- given a and b (assumed to be sorted) returns a merged array that
 // preserves order
 function '''merge'''(array ''a'', array ''b''): array

So far, following the methodology has led us to this point, but what about the base case? The base case is the part of the algorithm concerned with what happens when the problem cannot be broken into smaller subproblems. Here, the base case is when the array only has one element. The following is a sorting algorithm that faithfully sorts arrays of only zero or one elements:

 ''// base-sort -- given an array of one element (or empty), return a copy of the
 // array sorted''
 function '''base-sort'''(array ''a''[1..''n'']): array
   assert (''n'' &lt;= 1)
   return ''a''.copy()
 end

Putting this together, here is what the methodology has told us to write so far:

 ''// sort -- returns a sorted copy of array a''
 function '''sort'''(array ''a''[1..''n'']): array
   if ''n'' &lt;= 1: return ''a''.copy()
   else:
     let ''sub_size'' := ''n'' / 2
     let ''first_half'' := '''sort'''(''a''[1,..,''sub_size''])
     let ''second_half'' := '''sort'''(''a''[''sub_size'' + 1,..,''n''])
     
     return '''merge'''(''first_half'', ''second_half'')
   fi
 end

And, other than the unimplemented merge subroutine, this sorting algorithm is done! Before we cover how this algorithm works, here is how merge can be written:

 ''// merge -- given a and b (assumed to be sorted) returns a merged array that
 // preserves order''
 function '''merge'''(array ''a''[1..''n''], array ''b''[1..''m'']): array
   let ''result'' := new array[''n'' + ''m'']
   let ''i'', ''j'' := 1
   
   for ''k'' := 1 to ''n'' + ''m'':
     if ''i'' &gt;= ''n'': ''result''[''k''] := ''b''[''j'']; ''j'' += 1
     else-if ''j'' &gt;= ''m'': ''result''[''k''] := ''a''[''i'']; ''i'' += 1
     else:
       if ''a''[''i''] &lt; ''b''[''j'']:
         ''result''[''k''] := ''a''[''i'']; ''i'' += 1
       else:
         ''result''[''k''] := ''b''[''j'']; ''j'' += 1
       fi
     fi
   repeat
 end

[TODO: how it works; including correctness proof]
This algorithm uses the fact that, given two sorted arrays, the smallest element is always in one of two places. It's either at the head of the first array, or the head of the second.

=== Analysis ===

Let &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of steps the algorithm takes to run on input of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

Merging takes linear time and we recurse each time on two sub-problems of half the original size, so

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2\cdot T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + O(n).&lt;/math&gt;

By the master theorem, we see that this recurrence has a &quot;steady state&quot; tree. Thus, the runtime is:

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = O(n \cdot \log n).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen intuitivey by asking how may times does n need to be divided by 2 before the size of the array for sorting is 1? Why m times of course !

More directly, 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; = n , equivalent to  log  2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; = log n, equivalent to m x log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;2 = log &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; n , and since log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 2 = 1, equivalent to m = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;n.

Since m is the number of halvings of an array before the array is chopped up into bite sized pieces of 1-element arrays, and then it will take m levels of merging a sub-array with its neighbor where the sum size of sub-arrays will be n at each level, it will be exactly n/2 comparisons for merging at each level,
with m ( log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;n ) levels, thus O(n/2 x  log n ) &lt;=&gt; ''' O ( n log n).'''

=== Iterative Version ===

This merge sort algorithm can be turned into an iterative algorithm by iteratively merging each subsequent pair, then each group of four, et cetera. Due to a lack of function overhead, iterative algorithms tend to be faster in practice. However, because the recursive version's call tree is logarithmically deep, it does not require much run-time stack space: Even sorting 4 gigs of items would only require 32 call entries on the stack, a very modest amount considering if even each call required 256 bytes on the stack, it would only require 8 kilobytes.

The iterative version of mergesort is a minor modification to the recursive version - in fact we can reuse the earlier merging function.  The algorithm works by merging small, sorted subsections of the original array to create larger subsections of the array which are sorted.  To accomplish this, we iterate through the array with successively larger &quot;strides&quot;.

 ''// sort -- returns a sorted copy of array a''
 function '''sort_iterative'''(array ''a''[1..''n'']): array
    let ''result'' := ''a''.copy()
    for ''power'' := 0 to log2(''n''-1)
      let ''unit'' := 2^power
      for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'' by ''unit''*2
        if i+''unit''-1 &lt; n: 
          let ''a1''[1..''unit''] := ''result''[i..i+''unit''-1]
          let ''a2''[1..''unit''] := ''result''[i+''unit''..min(i+''unit''*2-1, ''n'')]
          ''result''[i..i+''unit''*2-1] := '''merge'''(''a1'',''a2'')
        fi
      repeat
    repeat
    
    return ''result''
 end

This works because each sublist of length 1 in the array is, by definition, sorted. Each iteration through the array (using counting variable ''i'') doubles the size of sorted sublists by merging adjacent sublists into sorted larger versions.  The current size of sorted sublists in the algorithm is represented by the ''unit'' variable.

=== space inefficiency ===

Straight forward merge sort requires a space of 2 x n , n to store the 2 sorted smaller arrays , and n to store the final result of merging. But merge sort still lends itself for batching of merging.

== Binary Search ==
Once an array is sorted, we can quickly locate items in the array by doing a binary search. Binary search is different from other divide and conquer algorithms in that it is mostly divide based (nothing needs to be conquered). The concept behind binary search will be useful for understanding the partition and quicksort algorithms, presented in the randomization chapter.

Finding an item in an already sorted array is similar to finding a name in a phonebook: you can start by flipping the book open toward the middle. If the name you're looking for is on that page, you stop. If you went too far, you can start the process again with the first half of the book. If the name you're searching for appears later than the page, you start from the second half of the book instead. You repeat this process, narrowing down your search space by half each time, until you find what you were looking for (or, alternatively, find where what you were looking for would have been if it were present).

The following algorithm states this procedure precisely:

 ''// binary-search -- returns the index of value in the given array, or''
 ''// -1 if value cannot be found. Assumes array is sorted in ascending order''
 function '''binary-search'''(''value'', array ''A''[1..''n'']): integer
   return '''search-inner'''(''value'', ''A'', 1, ''n'' + 1)
 end
 
 ''// search-inner -- search subparts of the array; end is one past the''
 ''// last element ''
 function '''search-inner'''(''value'', array ''A'', ''start'', ''end''): integer
   if ''start'' == ''end'': 
      return -1                   ''// not found''
   fi
 
   let ''length'' := ''end'' - ''start''
   if ''length'' == 1:
     if ''value'' == ''A''[''start'']:
       return ''start''
     else:
       return -1 
     fi
   fi
   
   let ''mid'' := ''start'' + (''length'' / 2)
   if ''value'' == ''A''[''mid'']:
     return ''mid''
   else-if ''value'' &gt; ''A''[''mid'']:
     return '''search-inner'''(''value'', ''A'', ''mid'' + 1, ''end'')
   else:
     return '''search-inner'''(''value'', ''A'', ''start'', ''mid'')
   fi
 end

Note that all recursive calls made are tail-calls, and thus the algorithm is iterative. We can explicitly remove the tail-calls if our programming language does not do that for us already by turning the argument values passed to the recursive call into assignments, and then looping to the top of the function body again:

 ''// binary-search -- returns the index of value in the given array, or''
 ''// -1 if value cannot be found. Assumes array is sorted in ascending order''
 function '''binary-search'''(''value'', array ''A''[1,..''n'']): integer
   let ''start'' := 1
   let ''end'' := ''n'' + 1
   
   loop:
     if ''start'' == ''end'': return -1 fi                 ''// not found''
   
     let ''length'' := ''end'' - ''start''
     if ''length'' == 1:
       if ''value'' == ''A''[''start'']: return ''start''
       else: return -1 fi
     fi
   
     let ''mid'' := ''start'' + (''length'' / 2)
     if ''value'' == ''A''[''mid'']:
       return ''mid''
     else-if ''value'' &gt; ''A''[''mid'']:
       ''start'' := ''mid'' + 1
     else:
       ''end'' := ''mid''
     fi
   repeat
 end

Even though we have an iterative algorithm, it's easier to reason about the recursive version. If the number of steps the algorithm takes is &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt;, then we have the following recurrence that defines &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 1\cdot T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + O(1).&lt;/math&gt;
The size of each recursive call made is on half of the input size (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), and there is a constant amount of time spent outside of the recursion (i.e., computing ''length'' and ''mid'' will take the same amount of time, regardless of how many elements are in the array). By the master theorem, this recurrence has values &lt;math&gt;a=1, b=2, k=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is a &quot;steady state&quot;  tree, and thus we use the steady state case that tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(n^k\cdot\log n) = \Theta(\log n).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, this algorithm takes logarithmic time. Typically, even when ''n'' is large, it is safe to let the stack grow by &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt; activation records through recursive calls.

==== difficulty in initially correct binary search implementations ====
The article on wikipedia on Binary Search also mentions the difficulty in writing a correct binary search
algorithm: for instance, the java Arrays.binarySearch(..) overloaded function implementation does an interative binary search which didn't work when large integers overflowed a simple expression of mid calculation mid = ( end + start) / 2 i.e. end + start &gt; max_positive_integer . Hence the above algorithm is more correct in using a length = end - start, and adding half length to start. The java binary Search algorithm gave a return value useful for finding the position of the nearest key  greater than  the search key, i.e. the position where the search key could be inserted.

i.e. it returns '' - (keypos+1)''   , if the search key wasn't found exactly, but an insertion point was needed for the search key ( insertion_point =  ''-return_value - 1''). Looking at [[boundary values]], an insertion point could be at the front of the list ( ip = 0, return value = -1 ), to the position just after the last element, ( ip = length(A),  return value = ''- length(A) - 1'') . 

As an exercise, trying to implement this functionality on the above iterative binary search can be useful for further comprehension.

== Integer Multiplication ==
If you want to perform arithmetic with small integers, you can simply use the built-in arithmetic hardware of your machine. However, if you wish to multiply integers larger than those that will fit into the standard &quot;word&quot; integer size of your computer, you will have to implement a multiplication algorithm in software or use a software implementation written by someone else. For example, RSA encryption needs to work with integers of very large size (that is, large relative to the 64-bit word size of many machines) and utilizes special multiplication algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;
A (mathematical) integer larger than the largest &quot;int&quot; directly supported by your computer's hardware is often called a &quot;BigInt&quot;.
Working with such large numbers is often called &quot;multiple precision arithmetic&quot;.
There are entire books on the various algorithms for dealing with such numbers, such as:

* [http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/mca/pub226.html Modern Computer Arithmetic], Richard Brent and Paul Zimmermann, Cambridge University Press, 2010.
* Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming , Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms (3rd edition), 1997.

People who implement such algorithms may
* write a one-off implementation for one particular application
* write a library that you can use for many applications, such as [http://gmplib.org/ GMP, the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library] or [https://mattmccutchen.net/bigint/ McCutchen's Big Integer Library] or various libraries [http://www.leemon.com/crypto/BigInt.html] [https://github.com/jasondavies/jsbn] [https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt] [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-crypto/] [http://www.cryptopp.com/] used to demonstrate RSA encryption 
* put those algorithms in the compiler of a programming language that you can use (such as Python and Lisp) that automatically switches from standard integers to BigInts when necessary
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grade School Multiplication ===
How do we represent a large, multi-word integer? We can have a binary representation by using an array (or an allocated block of memory) of words to represent the bits of the large integer. Suppose now that we have two integers, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, and we want to multiply them together. For simplicity, let's assume that both &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bits each (if one is shorter than the other, we can always pad on zeros at the beginning). The most basic way to multiply the integers is to use the grade school multiplication algorithm. This is even easier in binary, because we only multiply by 1 or 0:

          x6 x5 x4 x3 x2 x1 x0
       &amp;times;  y6 y5 y4 y3 y2 y1 y0
       -----------------------
          x6 x5 x4 x3 x2 x1 x0 (when y0 is 1; 0 otherwise)
       x6 x5 x4 x3 x2 x1 x0  0 (when y1 is 1; 0 otherwise)
    x6 x5 x4 x3 x2 x1 x0  0  0 (when y2 is 1; 0 otherwise)
 x6 x5 x4 x3 x2 x1 x0  0  0  0 (when y3 is 1; 0 otherwise)
   ... et cetera

As an algorithm, here's what multiplication would look like:

 ''// multiply -- return the product of two binary integers, both of length n''
 function '''multiply'''(bitarray ''x''[1,..''n''], bitarray ''y''[1,..''n'']): bitarray
   bitarray ''p'' = 0
   for ''i'':=1 to ''n'':
     if ''y''[''i''] == 1:
       ''p'' := '''add'''(''p'', ''x'')
     fi
     ''x'' := '''pad'''(''x'', 0)         ''// add another zero to the end of x''
   repeat
   return ''p''
 end

The subroutine '''add''' adds two binary integers and returns the result, and the subroutine '''pad''' adds an extra digit to the end of the number (padding on a zero is the same thing as shifting the number to the left; which is the same as multiplying it by two). Here, we loop ''n'' times, and in the worst-case, we make ''n'' calls to '''add'''. The numbers given to '''add''' will at most be of length &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;. Further, we can expect that the '''add''' subroutine can be done in linear time. Thus, if ''n'' calls to a &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; subroutine are made, then the algorithm takes &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time.

=== Divide and Conquer Multiplication ===
As you may have figured, this isn't the end of the story. We've presented the &quot;obvious&quot; algorithm for multiplication; so let's see if a divide and conquer strategy can give us something better. One route we might want to try is breaking the integers up into two parts. For example, the integer ''x'' could be divided into two parts, &lt;math&gt;x_{h}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{l}&lt;/math&gt;, for the high-order and low-order halves of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has ''n'' bits, we have

:&lt;math&gt;x = x_{h}\cdot 2^{n/2} + x_{l}&lt;/math&gt;

We could do the same for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;y = y_{h}\cdot 2^{n/2} + y_{l}&lt;/math&gt;

But from this division into smaller parts, it's not clear how we can multiply these parts such that we can combine the results for the solution to the main problem. First, let's write out &lt;math&gt;x\times y&lt;/math&gt; would be in such a system:

:&lt;math&gt;x\times y = x_h\times y_h\cdot (2^{n/2})^2 + (x_h\times y_l + x_l\times y_h)\cdot (2^{n/2}) + x_l\times y_l&lt;/math&gt;

This comes from simply multiplying the new hi/lo representations of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; together. The multiplication of the smaller pieces are marked by the &quot;&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;&quot; symbol. Note that the multiplies by &lt;math&gt;2^{n/2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(2^{n/2})^2 = 2^n&lt;/math&gt; does not require a real multiplication: we can just pad on the right number of zeros instead. This suggests the following divide and conquer algorithm:

 ''// multiply -- return the product of two binary integers, both of length n''
 function '''multiply'''(bitarray ''x''[1,..''n''], bitarray ''y''[1,..''n'']): bitarray
   if ''n'' == 1: return ''x''[1] * ''y''[1] fi          ''// multiply single digits: O(1)''
   
   let ''xh'' := ''x''[''n''/2 + 1, .., ''n'']               ''// array slicing, O(n)''
   let ''xl'' := ''x''[0, .., ''n'' / 2]                 ''// array slicing, O(n)''
   let ''yh'' := ''y''[''n''/2 + 1, .., ''n'']               ''// array slicing, O(n)''
   let ''yl'' := ''y''[0, .., ''n'' / 2]                 ''// array slicing, O(n)''
   
   let ''a'' := '''multiply'''(''xh'', ''yh'')                 ''// recursive call; T(n/2)''
   let ''b'' := '''multiply'''(''xh'', ''yl'')                 ''// recursive call; T(n/2)''
   let ''c'' := '''multiply'''(''xl'', ''yh'')                 ''// recursive call; T(n/2)''
   let ''d'' := '''multiply'''(''xl'', ''yl'')                 ''// recursive call; T(n/2)''
   
   ''b'' := '''add'''(''b'', ''c'')                            ''// regular addition; O(n)''
   ''a'' := '''shift'''(''a'', ''n'')                          ''// pad on zeros; O(n)''
   ''b'' := '''shift'''(''b'', ''n''/2)                        ''// pad on zeros; O(n)''
   return '''add'''(''a'', ''b'', ''d'')                       ''// regular addition; O(n)''
 end

We can use the master theorem to analyze the running time of this algorithm. Assuming that the algorithm's running time is &lt;math&gt;T(n)&lt;/math&gt;, the comments show how much time each step takes. Because there are four recursive calls, each with an input of size &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;a=4, b=2, k=1&lt;/math&gt;, and given that &lt;math&gt;4&gt;2^1&lt;/math&gt; we are in the &quot;bottom heavy&quot; case and thus plugging in these values into the bottom heavy case of the master theorem gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;T(n)=O(n^{\log_2 4}) = O(n^2).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, after all of that hard work, we're still no better off than the grade school algorithm! Luckily, numbers and polynomials are a data set we know additional information about. In fact, we can reduce the running time by doing some mathematical tricks.

First, let's replace the &lt;math&gt;2^{n/2}&lt;/math&gt; with a variable, ''z'':

:&lt;math&gt;x\times y = x_h*y_h z^2 + (x_h*y_l + x_l*y_h)z + x_l*y_l&lt;/math&gt;

This appears to be a quadratic formula, and we know that you only need three co-efficients or points on a graph in order to uniquely describe a quadratic formula. However, in our above algorithm we've been using four multiplications total. Let's try recasting &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as linear functions:

:&lt;math&gt;P_x(z) = x_h\cdot z + x_l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_y(z) = y_h\cdot z + y_l&lt;/math&gt;

Now, for &lt;math&gt;x\times y&lt;/math&gt; we just need to compute &lt;math&gt;(P_x\cdot P_y)(2^{n/2})&lt;/math&gt;. We'll evaluate &lt;math&gt;P_x(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_y(z)&lt;/math&gt; at three points. Three convenient points to evaluate the function will be at &lt;math&gt;(P_x\cdot P_y)(1), (P_x\cdot P_y)(0), (P_x\cdot P_y)(-1)&lt;/math&gt;:

[TODO: show how to make the two-parts breaking more efficient; then mention that the best multiplication uses the FFT, but don't actually cover that topic (which is saved for the advanced book)]

== Base Conversion ==
[TODO: Convert numbers from decimal to binary quickly using DnC.]

Along with the binary, the science of computers employs bases 8 and 16 for it's very easy to convert between the three while using bases 8 and 16 shortens considerably number representations.

To represent 8 first digits in the binary system we need 3 bits. Thus we have, 0=000, 1=001, 2=010, 3=011, 4=100, 5=101, 6=110, 7=111. Assume M=(2065)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. In order to obtain its binary representation, replace each of the four digits with the corresponding triple of bits: 010 000 110 101. After removing the leading zeros, binary representation is immediate: M=(10000110101)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (For the hexadecimal system conversion is quite similar, except that now one should use 4-bit representation of numbers below 16.) This fact follows from the general conversion algorithm and the observation that 8=&lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; (and, of course, 16=&lt;math&gt;2^4&lt;/math&gt;). Thus it appears that the shortest way to convert numbers into the binary system is to first convert them into either octal or hexadecimal representation. Now let see how to implement the general algorithm programmatically.

For the sake of reference, representation of a number in a system with base (radix) N may only consist of digits that are less than N. 

More accurately, if

:&lt;math&gt;(1) M = a_kN^k+a_{k-1}N^{k-1}+...+a_1N^1+a_0&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;0 &lt;= a_i &lt; N&lt;/math&gt; we have a representation of M in base N system and write

:&lt;math&gt;M = (a_ka_{k-1}...a_0)N&lt;/math&gt; 
If we rewrite (1) as

:&lt;math&gt;(2) M = a_0+N*(a_1+N*(a_2+N*...))&lt;/math&gt; 

the algorithm for obtaining coefficients ai becomes more obvious. For example, &lt;math&gt;a_0=M\ modulo\ n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1=(M/N)\ modulo\ n&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.

=== Recursive Implementation ===
Let's represent the algorithm mnemonically: (result is a string or character variable where I shall accumulate the digits of the result one at a time)

 result = &quot;&quot; 
 if M &lt; N, result = 'M' + result. Stop. 
 S = M mod N, result = 'S' + result
 M = M/N 
 goto 2 

A few words of explanation. 

&quot;&quot; is an empty string. You may remember it's a zero element for string concatenation. 
Here we check whether the conversion procedure is over. It's over if M is less than N in which case M is a digit (with some qualification for N&gt;10) and no additional action is necessary. Just prepend it in front of all other digits obtained previously. The '+' plus sign stands for the string concatenation. 
If we got this far, M is not less than N. First we extract its remainder of division by N, prepend this digit to the result as described previously, and reassign M to be M/N. 
This says that the whole process should be repeated starting with step 2. 
I would like to have a function say called Conversion that takes two arguments M and N and returns representation of the number M in base N. The function might look like this

 1 String Conversion(int M, int N) // return string, accept two integers 
 2 {  
 3     if (M &lt; N) // see if it's time to return 
 4         return new String(&quot;&quot;+M); // &quot;&quot;+M makes a string out of a digit 
 5     else // the time is not yet ripe 
 6         return Conversion(M/N, N) +
            new String(&quot;&quot;+(M mod N)); // continue 
 7 }  

This is virtually a working Java function and it would look very much the same in C++ and require only a slight modification for C. As you see, at some point the function calls itself with a different first argument. One may say that the function is defined in terms of itself. Such functions are called recursive. (The best known recursive function is factorial: n!=n*(n-1)!.) The function calls (applies) itself to its arguments, and then (naturally) applies itself to its new arguments, and then ... and so on. We can be sure that the process will eventually stop because the sequence of arguments (the first ones) is decreasing. Thus sooner or later the first argument will be less than the second and the process will start emerging from the recursion, still a step at a time.

=== Iterative Implementation ===
Not all programming languages allow functions to call themselves recursively. Recursive functions may also be undesirable if process interruption might be expected for whatever reason. For example, in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, the user may want to interrupt the demonstration being eager to test his or her understanding of the solution. There are complications due to the manner in which computers execute programs when one wishes to jump out of several levels of recursive calls.

Note however that the string produced by the conversion algorithm is obtained in the wrong order: all digits are computed first and then written into the string the last digit first. Recursive implementation easily got around this difficulty. With each invocation of the Conversion function, computer creates a new environment in which passed values of M, N, and the newly computed S are stored. Completing the function call, i.e. returning from the function we find the environment as it was before the call. Recursive functions store a sequence of computations implicitly. Eliminating recursive calls implies that we must manage to store the computed digits explicitly and then retrieve them in the reversed order.

In Computer Science such a mechanism is known as LIFO - Last In First Out. It's best implemented with a stack data structure. Stack admits only two operations: push and pop. Intuitively stack can be visualized as indeed a stack of objects. Objects are stacked on top of each other so that to retrieve an object one has to remove all the objects above the needed one. Obviously the only object available for immediate removal is the top one, i.e. the one that got on the stack last.

Then iterative implementation of the Conversion function might look as the following.

  1 String Conversion(int M, int N) // return string, accept two integers 
  2 {  
  3     Stack stack = new Stack(); // create a stack 
  4     while (M &gt;= N) // now the repetitive loop is clearly seen 
  5     {  
  6         stack.push(M mod N); // store a digit 
  7         M = M/N; // find new M 
  8     }  
  9     // now it's time to collect the digits together  
 10     String str = new String(&quot;&quot;+M); // create a string with a single digit M 
 11     while (stack.NotEmpty())  
 12         str = str+stack.pop() // get from the stack next digit 
 13     return str;  
 14 }  

The function is by far longer than its recursive counterpart; but, as I said, sometimes it's the one you want to use, and sometimes it's the only one you may actually use.

== Closest Pair of Points ==

For a set of points on a two-dimensional plane, if you want to find the closest two points, you could compare all of them to each other, at &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; time, or use a divide and conquer algorithm.

== Closest Pair: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach ==

=== Introduction ===
The brute force approach to the closest pair problem (i.e. checking every possible pair of points) takes quadratic time. We would now like to introduce a faster divide-and-conquer algorithm for solving the closest pair problem.
Given a set of points in the plane S, our approach will be to split the set into two roughly equal halves (S1 and S2) for which we already have the solutions, and then to merge the halves in linear time to yield an O(nlogn) algorithm.
However, the actual solution is far from obvious. It is possible that the desired pair might have one point in S1 and one in S2, does this not force us once again to check all possible pairs of points? The divide-and-conquer approach presented here generalizes directly from the one dimensional algorithm we presented in the previous section. 

=== Closest Pair in the Plane ===
Alright, we'll generalize our 1-D algorithm as directly as possible (see figure 3.2). Given a set of points S in the plane, we partition it into two subsets S1 and S2 by a vertical line l such that the points in S1 are to the left of l and those in S2 are to the right of l.

We now recursively solve the problem on these two sets obtaining minimum distances of d1 (for S1), and d2 (for S2). We let d be the minimum of these.

Now, identical to the 1-D case, if the closes pair of the whole set consists of one point from each subset, then these two points must be within d of l. This area is represented as the two strips P1 and P2 on either side of l 

Up to now, we are completely in step with the 1-D case. At this point, however, the extra dimension causes some problems. We wish to determine if some point in say P1 is less than d away from another point in P2. However, in the plane, we don't have the luxury that we had on the line when we observed that only one point in each set can be within d of the median. In fact, in two dimensions, all of the points could be in the strip! This is disastrous, because we would have to compare n2 pairs of points to merge the set, and hence our divide-and-conquer algorithm wouldn't save us anything in terms of efficiency.  Thankfully, we can make another life saving observation at this point. For any particular point p in one strip, only points that meet the following constraints in the other strip need to be checked: 

* those points within d of p in the direction of the other strip 
* those within d of p in the positive and negative y directions 

Simply because points outside of this bounding box cannot be less than d units from p (see figure 3.3). It just so happens that because every point in this box is at least d apart, there can be at most six points within it.

Now we don't need to check all n2 points. All we have to do is sort the points in the strip by their y-coordinates and scan the points in order, checking each point against a maximum of 6 of its neighbors. This means at most 6*n comparisons are required to check all candidate pairs.
However, since we sorted the points in the strip by their y-coordinates the process of merging our two subsets is not linear, but in fact takes O(nlogn) time.  
Hence our full algorithm is not yet O(nlogn), but it is still an improvement on the quadratic performance of the brute force approach (as we shall see in the next section). In section 3.4, we will demonstrate how to make this algorithm even more efficient by strengthening our recursive sub-solution.

=== Summary and Analysis of the 2-D Algorithm ===
We present here a step by step summary of the algorithm presented in the previous section, followed by a performance analysis. The algorithm is simply written in list form because I find pseudo-code to be burdensome and unnecessary when trying to understand an algorithm. Note that we pre-sort the points according to their x coordinates, and maintain another structure which holds the points sorted by their y values(for step 4), which in itself takes O(nlogn) time.

ClosestPair of a set of points:

# Divide the set into two equal sized parts by the line l, and recursively compute the minimal distance in each part.
# Let d be the minimal of the two minimal distances.
# Eliminate points that lie farther than d apart from l.
# Consider the remaining points according to their y-coordinates, which we have precomputed.
# Scan the remaining points in the y order and compute the distances of each point to all of its neighbors that are distanced no more than d(that's why we need it sorted according to y). Note that there are no more than 5(there is no figure 3.3 , so this 5 or 6 doesnt make sense without that figure . Please include it .) such points(see previous section).
# If any of these distances is less than d then update d. 

Analysis:
* Let us note T(n) as the efficiency of out algorithm
* Step 1 takes 2T(n/2) (we apply our algorithm for both halves)
* Step 3 takes O(n) time 
* Step 5 takes O(n) time (as we saw in the previous section) 

so,

&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)&lt;/math&gt;

which, according the Master Theorem, result

&lt;math&gt;T(n) \isin O(nlogn)&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the merging of the sub-solutions is dominated by the sorting at step 4, and hence takes O(nlogn) time.

This must be repeated once for each level of recursion in the divide-and-conquer algorithm,

hence the whole of algorithm ClosestPair takes O(logn*nlogn) = O(nlog2n) time.

=== Improving the Algorithm ===
We can improve on this algorithm slightly by reducing the time it takes to achieve the y-coordinate sorting in Step 4. This is done by asking that the recursive solution computed in Step 1 returns the points in sorted order by their y coordinates. This will yield two sorted lists of points which need only be merged (a linear time operation) in Step 4 in order to yield a complete sorted list. Hence the revised algorithm involves making the following changes: 
Step 1: Divide the set into..., and recursively compute the distance in each part, returning the points in each set in sorted order by y-coordinate. 
Step 4: Merge the two sorted lists into one sorted list in O(n) time. 
Hence the merging process is now dominated by the linear time steps thereby yielding an O(nlogn) algorithm for finding the closest pair of a set of points in the plane.

== Towers Of Hanoi Problem ==
[TODO: Write about the towers of hanoi algorithm and a program for it]

There are n distinct sized discs and three pegs such that discs are placed at the left peg in the order of their sizes. The smallest one is at the top while the largest one is at the bottom. This game is to move all the discs from the left peg 

===Rules===

1) Only one disc can be moved in each step.

2) Only the disc at the top can be moved.

3) Any disc can only be placed on the top of a larger disc.

===Solution===
====Intuitive Idea====
In order to move the largest disc from the left peg to the middle peg, the smallest discs must be moved to the right peg first. After the largest one is moved. The smaller discs are then moved from the right peg to the middle peg.

====Recurrence====
Suppose n is the number of discs.

To move n discs from peg a to peg b,

1) If n&gt;1 then move n-1 discs from peg a to peg c

2) Move n-th disc from peg a to peg b

3) If n&gt;1 then move n-1 discs from peg c to peg a  

====Pseudocode====
 void hanoi(n,src,dst){
   if (n&gt;1)
     hanoi(n-1,src,pegs-{src,dst});
   print &quot;move n-th disc from src to dst&quot;;
   if (n&gt;1)
     hanoi(n-1,pegs-{src,dst},dst);
 }

====Analysis====
The analysis is trivial.
&lt;math&gt; T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1) = O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt;

As deterministic algorithms are driven to their limits when one tries to solve hard problems with them, a useful technique to speed up the computation is '''randomization'''. In randomized algorithms, the algorithm has access to a ''random source'', which can be imagined as tossing coins during the computation. Depending on the outcome of the toss, the algorithm may split up its computation path.

There are two main types of randomized algorithms: Las Vegas algorithms and Monte-Carlo algorithms. In Las Vegas algorithms, the algorithm may use the randomness to speed up the computation, but the algorithm must always return the correct answer to the input. Monte-Carlo algorithms do not have the former restriction, that is, they are allowed to give ''wrong'' return values. However, returning a wrong return value must have a ''small probability'', otherwise that Monte-Carlo algorithm would not be of any use.

Many approximation algorithms use randomization.

== Ordered Statistics ==
Before covering randomized techniques, we'll start with a deterministic problem that leads to a problem that utilizes randomization. Suppose you have an unsorted array of values and you want to find

* the maximum value,
* the minimum value, and
* the median value.

In the immortal words of one of our former computer science professors, &quot;How can you do?&quot;

=== find-max ===
First, it's relatively straightforward to find the largest element:

 ''// find-max -- returns the maximum element''
 function '''find-max'''(array ''vals''[1..''n'']): element
   let ''result'' := ''vals[1]''
   for ''i'' from ''2'' to ''n'':
     ''result'' := max(''result'', ''vals[i]'')
   repeat
   
   return ''result''
 end

An initial assignment of &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to ''result'' would work as well, but this is a useless call to the max function since the first element compared gets set to ''result''.  By initializing result as such the function only requires ''n-1'' comparisons. (Moreover, in languages capable of metaprogramming, the data type may not be strictly numerical and there might be no good way of assigning &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;; using vals[1] is type-safe.)

A similar routine to find the minimum element can be done by calling the min function instead of the max function.

=== find-min-max ===

But now suppose you want to find the min and the max at the same time; here's one solution:

 ''// find-min-max -- returns the minimum and maximum element of the given array''
 function '''find-min-max'''(array ''vals''): pair
   return pair {'''find-min'''(''vals''), '''find-max'''(''vals'')}
 end

Because '''find-max''' and '''find-min''' both make ''n-1'' calls to the max or min functions (when ''vals'' has ''n'' elements), the total number of comparisons made in '''find-min-max''' is &lt;math&gt;2n-2&lt;/math&gt;.

However, some redundant comparisons are being made. These redundancies can be removed by &quot;weaving&quot; together the min and max functions:

 ''// find-min-max -- returns the minimum and maximum element of the given array''
 function '''find-min-max'''(array ''vals''[1..''n'']): pair
   let ''min'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   let ''max'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   
   if ''n'' is odd:
     ''min'' := ''max'' := ''vals''[1]
     ''vals'' := ''vals''[2,..,''n'']          ''// we can now assume n is even''
     ''n'' := ''n'' - 1
   fi
   
   for ''i'':=1 to ''n'' by 2:             ''// consider pairs of values in vals''
     if ''vals''[''i''] &lt; ''vals''[''i'' + 1]:
       let ''a'' := ''vals''[''i'']
       let ''b'' := ''vals''[''i'' + 1]
     else:
       let ''a'' := ''vals''[''i'' + 1]
       let ''b'' := ''vals''[''i'']            ''// invariant: a &lt;= b''
     fi
     
     if ''a'' &lt; ''min'': ''min'' := ''a'' fi
     if ''b'' &gt; ''max'': ''max'' := ''b'' fi
   repeat
   
   return pair {''min'', ''max''}
 end

Here, we only loop &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; times instead of ''n'' times, but for each iteration we make three comparisons. Thus, the number of comparisons made is &lt;math&gt;(3/2)n = 1.5n&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in a &lt;math&gt;3/4&lt;/math&gt; speed up over the original algorithm.

Only three comparisons need to be made instead of four because, by construction, it's always the case that &lt;math&gt;a\le b&lt;/math&gt;. (In the first part of the &quot;if&quot;, we actually know more specifically that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;, but under the else part, we can only conclude that &lt;math&gt;a\le b&lt;/math&gt;.) This property is utilized by noting that ''a'' doesn't need to be compared with the current maximum, because ''b'' is already greater than or equal to ''a'', and similarly, ''b'' doesn't need to be compared with the current minimum, because ''a'' is already less than or equal to ''b''.

In software engineering, there is a struggle between using libraries versus writing customized algorithms. In this case, the min and max functions weren't used in order to get a faster '''find-min-max''' routine. Such an operation would probably not be the bottleneck in a real-life program: however, if testing reveals the routine should be faster, such an approach should be taken. Typically, the solution that reuses libraries is better overall than writing customized solutions. Techniques such as open implementation and aspect-oriented programming may help manage this contention to get the best of both worlds, but regardless it's a useful distinction to recognize.

=== find-median ===
Finally, we need to consider how to find the median value. One approach is to sort the array then extract the median from the position &lt;tt&gt;''vals''[''n''/2]&lt;/tt&gt;:

 ''// find-median -- returns the median element of vals''
 function '''find-median'''(array ''vals''[1..''n'']): element
   assert (''n'' &gt; 0)
   
   sort(''vals'')
   return ''vals''[''n'' / 2]
 end

If our values are not numbers close enough in value (or otherwise cannot be sorted by a radix sort) the sort above is going to require &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt; steps.

However, it is possible to extract the ''n''th-ordered statistic in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time.  The key is eliminating the sort: we don't actually require the entire array to be sorted in order to find the median, so there is some waste in sorting the entire array first. One technique we'll use to accomplish this is randomness.

Before presenting a non-sorting '''find-median''' function, we introduce a divide and conquer-style operation known as '''partitioning'''. What we want is a routine that finds a random element in the array and then partitions the array into three parts:

# elements that are less than or equal to the random element;
# elements that are equal to the random element; and
# elements that are greater than or equal to the random element.

These three sections are denoted by two integers: ''j'' and ''i''. The partitioning is performed &quot;in place&quot; in the array:

 ''// partition -- break the array three partitions based on a randomly picked element''
 function '''partition'''(array ''vals''): pair{''j'', ''i''}

Note that when the random element picked is actually represented three or more times in the array it's possible for entries in all three partitions to have the same value as the random element. While this operation may not sound very useful, it has a powerful property that can be exploited: When the partition operation completes, the randomly picked element will be in the same position in the array as it would be if the array were fully sorted!

This property might not sound so powerful, but recall the optimization for the '''find-min-max''' function: we noticed that by picking elements from the array in pairs and comparing them to each other first we could reduce the total number of comparisons needed (because the current min and max values need to be compared with only one value each, and not two). A similar concept is used here.

While the code for '''partition''' is not magical, it has some tricky boundary cases:

 ''// partition -- break the array into three ordered partitions from a random element''
 function '''partition'''(array ''vals''): pair{''j'', ''i''}
   let ''m'' := 0
   let ''n'' := ''vals''.length - 2   //  for an array vals, vals[vals.length-1] is the last element, which holds the partition, 
                                      // so the last sort element is vals[vals.length-2]
   let ''irand'' := random(''m'', ''n'')   ''// returns any value from m to n''
   let ''x'' := ''vals''[''irand'']
   swap( ''irand'',''n''+ 1 ) // n+1 = vals.length-1 , which is the right most element, and acts as store for partition element and sentinel for m
   // values in ''vals''[''n''..] are greater than ''x''
   // values in ''vals''[0..''m''] are less than ''x''
   while (m &lt;= n  ) // see explanation in quick sort why should be m &lt;= n instead of m &lt; n in the 2 element case, 
                   // vals.length -2 = 0 = n = m, but if the 2-element case is out-of-order vs. in-order, there must be a different action.
                   // by implication, the different action occurs within this loop, so must process the m = n case before exiting.
      while ''vals''[''m''] &lt;= ''x''  // in the 2-element case, second element is partition, first element at m. If in-order, m will increment
         ''m''++
      endwhile
      while ''x'' &lt;  ''vals''[''n''] &amp;&amp; ''n'' &gt; 0   // stops if vals[n] belongs in left partition or hits start of array
         ''n''--
      endwhile
      if ( m &gt;= n) break;
      swap(''m'',''n'')                // exchange ''vals''[''n''] and ''vals''[''m'']
      ''m''++   // don't rescan swapped elements
      ''n''--
      
   endwhile
   // partition: [0..''m''-1]   []   [''n''+1..]   note that ''m''=''n''+1
   // if you need non empty sub-arrays:
   swap(''m'',''vals''.length - 1)  // put the partition element in the between left and right partitions
    // in 2-element out-of-order case, m=0 (not incremented in loop), and the first and last(second) element will swap.
   // partition: [0..''n''-1]   [''n''..''n'']   [''n''+1..]
 end

We can use '''partition''' as a subroutine for a general '''find''' operation:

 ''// find -- moves elements in vals such that location k holds the value it would when sorted''
 function '''find'''(array ''vals'', integer ''k'')
   assert (0 &lt;= ''k'' &lt; ''vals''.length)        ''// k it must be a valid index''
   if ''vals''.length &lt;= 1:
     return
   fi
   
   let pair (''j'', ''i'') := '''partition'''(''vals'')
   if ''k'' &lt;= ''i'':
     '''find'''(''a''[0,..,''i''], ''k'')
   else-if ''j'' &lt;= ''k'':
     '''find'''(''a''[''j'',..,''n''], ''k'' - ''j'')
   fi
   TODO: debug this!
 end

Which leads us to the punch-line:

  ''// find-median -- returns the median element of vals''
 function '''find-median'''(array ''vals''): element
   assert (''vals''.length &gt; 0)
   
   let ''median_index'' := ''vals''.length / 2;
   '''find'''(''vals'', ''median_index'')
   return ''vals''[''median_index'']
 end

One consideration that might cross your mind is &quot;is the random call really necessary?&quot; For example, instead of picking a random pivot, we could always pick the middle element instead. Given that our algorithm works with all possible arrays, we could conclude that the running time on average for ''all of the possible inputs'' is the same as our analysis that used the random function. The reasoning here is that under the set of all possible arrays, the middle element is going to be just as &quot;random&quot; as picking anything else. But there's a pitfall in this reasoning: Typically, the input to an algorithm in a program isn't random at all. For example, the input has a higher probability of being sorted than just by chance alone. Likewise, because it is real data from real programs, the data might have other patterns in it that could lead to suboptimal results.

To put this another way: for the randomized median finding algorithm, there is a very small probability it will run suboptimally, independent of what the input is; while for a deterministic algorithm that just picks the middle element, there is a greater chance it will run poorly on some of the most frequent input types it will receive. This leads us to the following guideline:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot; &gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Randomization Guideline:'''&lt;br&gt;
If your algorithm depends upon randomness, be sure you introduce the randomness yourself instead of depending upon the data to be random.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Note that there are &quot;derandomization&quot; techniques that can take an average-case fast algorithm and turn it into a fully deterministic algorithm. Sometimes the overhead of derandomization is so much that it requires very large datasets to get any gains. Nevertheless, derandomization in itself has theoretical value.

The randomized '''find''' algorithm was invented by C. A. R. &quot;Tony&quot; Hoare. While Hoare is an important figure in computer science, he may be best known in general circles for his quicksort algorithm, which we discuss in the next section.

== Quicksort ==
The median-finding partitioning algorithm in the previous section is actually very close to the implementation of a full blown sorting algorithm. Building a Quicksort Algorithm is left as an exercise for the reader, and is recommended first, before reading the next section ( Quick sort is diabolical compared to Merge sort, which is a sort not improved by a randomization step ) . 

A key part of quick sort is choosing the right median. But to get it up and running quickly, start with the assumption that the array is unsorted, and the rightmost element of each array is as likely to be the
median as any other element, and that we are entirely optimistic that the rightmost doesn't happen to be the largest key , which would mean we would be removing one element only ( the partition element)
at each step, and having no right array to sort, and a n-1 left array to sort.

This is where '''randomization'''  is important for quick sort, i.e. ''choosing the more optimal partition key'', which is pretty important for quick sort to work efficiently. 

Compare the number of comparisions that are required for quick sort vs. insertion sort. 

With insertion sort, the average number of comparisons for finding the lowest first element in an ascending sort of a randomized array is n /2 . 

The second element's average number of comparisons is (n-1)/2; 

the third element ( n- 2) / 2. 

The total number of comparisons is   [ n  + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) .. + (n - [n-1]) ]  divided by 2,   which is  [ n x n - (n-1)! ] /2  or about O(n squared) .

In Quicksort, the number of comparisons will halve at each partition step if the true median is chosen,  since the left half partition doesn't need to be compared with the right half partition, but at each step , the number
elements of all partitions created by the previously level of partitioning will still be n. 

The number of levels of comparing n elements is the number of steps of dividing n by two , until n = 1.  Or in reverse, 2 ^ m ~ n, so m = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; n. 

So the total number of comparisons is n (elements)  x m (levels of scanning)  or  n x log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;n  , 

So the number of comparison is O(n x log &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(n) ) ,  which is smaller than insertion sort's  O(n^2) or O( n x n ).

(Comparing O(n x log &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(n) ) with O( n x n ) , the common factor n can be eliminated , and the comparison is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(n) vs n , which is exponentially different as n becomes larger.  e.g. compare  n = 2^16  , or 16 vs 32768, or 32 vs 4 gig ).  

To implement the partitioning in-place on a part of the array determined by a previous recursive call, what is needed a scan from
each end of the part , swapping whenever the value of the left scan's current location is greater than the partition value, and the value of the right scan's current location is less than the partition value. 
So the initial step is :-
  Assign the partition value to the right most element, swapping if necessary.

So the partitioning step is :-
  increment the left scan pointer while the current value is less than the partition value.
  decrement the right scan pointer while the current value is more than the partition value , 
  or the location is equal to or more than the left most location.
  exit if the pointers have crossed ( l &gt;= r), 
  OTHERWISE
  perform a swap where the left and right pointers have stopped ,
  on values where the left pointer's value is greater than the partition,
  and the right pointer's value is less than the partition.
 
  Finally, after exiting the loop because the left and right pointers  have crossed,
  ''swap the ''rightmost'' partition value, 
  with the last location of the '''left''' forward scan pointer '',   
  and hence ends up between the left and right partitions. 

Make sure at this point , that after the final swap, the cases of a 2 element in-order array, and a 2 element out-of-order array , are handled correctly,
which should mean all cases are handled correctly. This is a good debugging step for getting quick-sort to work.

'''For the in-order two-element case''',  the left pointer stops on the partition or second element , as the partition value is found. The right pointer , scanning backwards, starts on the first element before the partition, and stops because it is in the leftmost position. 

The pointers cross, and the loop exits before doing a loop swap. Outside the loop, the contents of the left pointer at the rightmost position and the partition , also at the right most position , are swapped, achieving no change to the in-order two-element case.

'''For the out-of-order two-element case''', The left pointer scans and stops at the first element, because it is greater than the partition (left scan value stops to swap values greater than the partition value).

The right pointer starts and stops at the first element because it has reached the leftmost element. 

The loop exits because left pointer and right pointer are equal at the first position, and the contents of the left pointer at the first position  and the partition at the rightmost (other) position , are swapped , putting previously out-of-order elements ,  into order. 

Another implementation issue, is to how to move the pointers during scanning. Moving them at the end of the outer loop seems logical.

 partition(a,l,r) {
   v = a[r];
   i = l;
   j = r -1;
  while ( i &lt;= j ) {  // need to also scan when i = j as well as i &lt; j , 
                            // in the 2 in-order case, 
                            // so that i is incremented to the  partition 
                            // and nothing happens in the final swap with the partition at r.
     while ( a[i] &lt; v) ++i;
     while ( v &lt;= a[j] &amp;&amp; j &gt; 0  ) --j;
     if ( i &gt;= j) break;
     swap(a,i,j);
     ++i; --j;
  }
  swap(a, i, r);
  return i;

With the pre-increment/decrement unary operators, scanning can be done just before testing within the test condition of the while loops,
but this means the pointers should be offset -1 and +1 respectively at the start : so the algorithm then looks like:-

 partition (a, l, r ) {
  v=a[r]; // v is partition value, at a[r]
  i=l-1;
  j=r;
  while(true) {
   while(  a[++i] &lt; v ); 
   while( v &lt;= a[--j]  &amp;&amp; j &gt; l );
   if (i &gt;= j) break;
   swap ( a, i, j);
  }
  swap (a,i,r);
  return i;
 }

And the qsort algorithm is
 
 qsort( a, l, r)  {
   if (l &gt;= r) return ;
   p = partition(a, l, r)
   qsort(a , l, p-1)
   qsort( a, p+1, r)
}

Finally, randomization of the partition element. 

 random_partition (a,l,r) {
  p = random_int( r-l) + l;
  // median of a[l], a[p] , a[r]
  if (a[p] &lt; a[l]) p =l;
  if ( a[r]&lt; a[p]) p = r;
  swap(a, p, r);
 }

this can be called just before calling partition in qsort().

== Shuffling an Array ==

   '''This keeps data in during shuffle'''
   temporaryArray = { }
   '''This records if an item has been shuffled'''
   usedItemArray = { }
   '''Number of item in array'''
   itemNum = 0
   while ( itemNum != lengthOf( inputArray) ){
       usedItemArray[ itemNum ] = false '''None of the items have been shuffled'''
       itemNum = itemNum + 1
   }
   itemNum = 0 '''we'll use this again'''
   itemPosition = randdomNumber( 0 --- (lengthOf(inputArray) - 1 ))
   while( itemNum != lengthOf( inputArray ) ){
       while( usedItemArray[ itemPosition ] != false ){
           itemPosition = randdomNumber( 0 --- (lengthOf(inputArray) - 1 ))
       }
       temporaryArray[ itemPosition ] = inputArray[ itemNum ]
       itemNum = itemNum + 1
   }
   inputArray = temporaryArray

== Equal Multivariate Polynomials ==
[TODO: as of now, there is no known deterministic polynomial time solution, but there is a randomized polytime solution. The canonical example used to be IsPrime, but a deterministic, polytime solution has been found.]
== Hash tables ==
Hashing relies on a hashcode function to randomly distribute keys to available slots evenly. In java , this is done in a fairly straight forward method of adding a moderate sized prime number (31 * 17 ) to a integer key , and then modulus by the size of the hash table. For string keys, the initial hash  number is obtained by adding the products of each character's ordinal value multiplied by 31. 

The wikibook Data Structures/Hash Tables chapter covers the topic well.

== Skip Lists ==
[TODO: Talk about skips lists. The point is to show how randomization can sometimes make a structure easier to understand, compared to the complexity of balanced trees.]

Dictionary or Map , is a general concept where a value is inserted under some key, and retrieved by the key. For instance, in some languages , the dictionary concept is built-in (Python), in others , it is in core libraries ( C++ S.T.L. , and Java standard collections library ). The library providing languages usually lets the programmer choose between a hash algorithm, or a balanced binary tree implementation (red-black trees). Recently, skip lists have been offered, because they offer advantages of being implemented to be highly concurrent for multiple threaded applications. 

Hashing is a technique that depends on the randomness of keys when passed through a hash function, to find a hash value that corresponds to an index into a linear table. Hashing works as fast as the hash function, but works well only if the inserted keys spread out evenly in the array, as any keys that hash to the same index , have to be deal with as a hash collision problem e.g. by keeping a linked list for collisions for each slot in the table, and iterating through the list to compare the full key of each key-value pair vs the search key. 

The disadvantage of hashing is that in-order traversal is not possible with this data structure. 

Binary trees can be used to represent dictionaries, and in-order traversal of binary trees is possible by  visiting of nodes ( visit left child, visit current node, visit right child, recursively ). Binary trees can suffer from poor search when they are &quot;unbalanced&quot; e.g. the keys of key-value pairs that are inserted were inserted in ascending or descending order, so they effectively look like ''linked lists'' with no left child, and all right children.  ''self-balancing'' binary trees can be done probabilistically (using randomness) or deterministically ( using child link coloring as red or black ) , through local 3-node tree '''rotation''' operations. A rotation is simply swapping a parent with a child node, but preserving order e.g. for a left child rotation, the left child's right child becomes the parent's left child, and the parent becomes the left child's right child.

'''Red-black trees''' can be understood more easily if corresponding '''2-3-4 trees''' are examined. A 2-3-4 tree is a tree where nodes can have 2 children, 3 children, or 4 children, with 3 children nodes having 2 keys between the 3 children, and 4 children-nodes having 3 keys between the 4 children. 4-nodes are actively split into 3 single key 2 -nodes, and the middle 2-node passed up to be merged with the parent node , which , if a one-key 2-node, becomes a two key 3-node; or if a two key 3-node, becomes a 4-node, which will be later split (on the way up). The act of splitting a three key 4-node is actually a re-balancing operation, that prevents a string of 3 nodes of grandparent, parent , child occurring , without a balancing rotation happening. 2-3-4 trees are a limited example of '''B-trees''', which usually have enough nodes as to fit a physical disk block, to facilitate caching of very large indexes that can't fit in physical RAM ( which is much less common nowadays).

A '''red-black tree''' is a binary tree representation of a 2-3-4 tree, where 3-nodes are modeled by a parent with one red child, and 4 -nodes modeled by a parent with two red children. Splitting of a 4-node is represented by the parent with 2 red children, '''flipping''' the red children to black, and  itself into red. There is never a case where the parent is already red, because there also occurs balancing operations where if there is a grandparent with a red parent with a red child , the grandparent is rotated to be a child of the parent, and parent is made black and the grandparent is made red; this unifies with the previous '''flipping''' scenario, of a 4-node represented by 2 red children. Actually, it may be this standardization of 4-nodes with mandatory rotation of skewed or zigzag 4-nodes that results in re-balancing of the binary tree.

A newer optimization is to left rotate any single right red child to a single left red child, so that only right rotation of left-skewed inline 4-nodes (3 red nodes inline ) would ever occur, simplifying the re-balancing code.

'''Skip lists''' are modeled after single linked lists, except nodes are multilevel. Tall nodes are rarer, but the insert operation ensures nodes are connected at each level. 

Implementation of skip lists requires creating randomly high multilevel nodes, and then inserting them.

Nodes are created using iteration of a random function where high level node occurs later in an iteration, and are rarer, because the iteration has survived a number of random thresholds (e.g. 0.5, if the random is between 0 and 1). 

Insertion requires a temporary previous node array with the height of the generated inserting node. It is  used to store the last pointer for a given level , which has a key less than the insertion key. 

The scanning begins at the head of the skip list, at highest level of the head node, and proceeds across until a node is found with a key higher than the insertion key, and the previous pointer stored in the temporary previous node array. Then the next lower level is scanned from that node , and so on, walking zig-zag down, until the lowest level is reached. 

Then a list insertion is done at each level of the temporary previous node array, so that the previous node's next node at each level is made the next node for that level for the inserting node, and the inserting node is made the previous node's next node.

Search involves iterating from the highest level of the head node to the lowest level, and scanning along the next pointer for each level until a node greater than the search key is found, moving down to the next level , and proceeding with the scan, until the higher keyed node at the lowest level has been found, or the search key found.

The creation of less frequent-when-taller , randomized height nodes, and the process of linking in all nodes at  every level, is what gives skip lists their advantageous overall structure. 

===a method of skip list implementation : implement lookahead single-linked linked list, then test , then transform to skip list implementation , then same test, then performance comparison===
What follows is a implementation of skip lists in python.
A single linked list looking at next node as always the current node, is implemented first,
then the skip list implementation follows, attempting minimal modification of the former, 
and comparison helps clarify implementation.

=== Role of Randomness ===
The idea of making higher nodes geometrically randomly less common, means there are less keys to compare with the higher the level of comparison, and since these are randomly selected, this should get rid of problems of degenerate input that makes it necessary to do tree balancing in tree algorithms. Since the higher level list have
more widely separated elements, but the search algorithm moves down a level after each search terminates at a level, the higher levels help &quot;skip&quot; over the need to search
earlier elements on lower lists. Because there are multiple levels of skipping, it becomes less likely that a meagre skip at a higher level won't be compensated by better skips at lower levels, and Pugh claims  O(logN) performance overall.

Conceptually , is it easier to understand than balancing trees and hence easier to implement ? The development of ideas from binary trees, balanced binary trees,
2-3 trees, red-black trees, and B-trees make a stronger conceptual network but is progressive in development, so arguably, once red-black trees are understood, they have more conceptual context to aid memory , or refresh of memory.

=== concurrent access application ===
Apart from using randomization to enhance a basic memory structure of linked lists, skip lists can also
be extended as a global data structure used in a multiprocessor application. See supplementary topic at the end of the chapter.

=== Idea for an exercise ===
Replace the Linux completely fair scheduler red-black tree implementation with a skip list , and see how your brand of Linux runs after recompiling.

== Treaps ==
A treap is a two keyed binary tree, that uses a second randomly generated key and the previously discussed 
tree operation of parent-child rotation to randomly rotate the tree so that overall, a balanced tree is produced. Recall that binary trees work by having all nodes in the left subtree small than a given node, and all nodes in a right subtree greater. Also recall that node rotation does not break this order ( some people call it an invariant), but changes the relationship of parent and child, so that if the parent was smaller than a right child, then the parent becomes the left child of the formerly right child. The  idea of a tree-heap or treap, is that a binary heap relationship is maintained between parents and child, and that is a parent
node has higher priority than its children, which is not the same as the left , right order of keys in a binary tree, and hence a recently inserted leaf node in a binary tree which happens to have a high random priority, can be rotated so it is relatively higher in the tree, having no parent with a lower priority. 

A treap is an alternative to both red-black trees, and skip lists, as a self-balancing sorted storage structure.

=== Treaps compared and contrasted to Splay trees ===
''Splay trees'' are similiar to treaps in that rotation is used to bring a higher priority node to the top without
changing the main key order, except instead of using a random key for priority, the last accessed node is rotated to the root of the tree, so that more frequently accessed nodes will be near the top. This means that in treaps, inserted nodes will only rotate upto the priority given by their random priority key, whereas in splay trees, the inserted node is rotated to the root, and every search in a splay tree will result in a re-balancing, but not so in a treap.

== Derandomization ==
[TODO: Deterministic algorithms for Quicksort exist that perform as well as quicksort in the average case and are guaranteed to perform at least that well in all cases. Best of all, no randomization is needed. Also in the discussion should be some perspective on using randomization: some randomized algorithms give you better confidence probabilities than the actual hardware itself! (e.g. sunspots can randomly flip bits in hardware, causing failure, which is a risk we take quite often)]

[Main idea: Look at all blocks of 5 elements, and pick the median (O(1) to pick), put all medians into an array (O(n)), recursively pick the medians of that array, repeat until you have &lt; 5 elements in the array. This recursive median constructing of every five elements takes time T(n)=T(n/5) + O(n), which by the master theorem is O(n). Thus, in O(n) we can find the right pivot. Need to show that this pivot is sufficiently good so that we're still O(n log n) no matter what the input is. This version of quicksort doesn't need rand, and it never performs poorly. Still need to show that element picked out is sufficiently good for a pivot.]

== Exercises ==

== Supplementary Topic: skip lists and multiprocessor algorithms ==
Multiprocessor hardware provides  CAS ( compare-and-set) or CMPEXCHG( compare-and-exchange)(intel manual 253666.pdf, p 3-188) atomic operations,  where an expected value is loaded into the accumulator register, which is compared to a target memory location's contents, and if the same, a source memory location's contents is loaded into the target memories contents, and the zero flag set, otherwise, if different, the target memory's contents is returned in the accumulator, and the zero flag is unset, signifying , for instance, a lock contention. In the intel architecture, a LOCK instruction is issued before CMPEXCHG , which either locks the cache from concurrent access if the memory location is being cached, or locks a shared memory location if not in the cache , for the next instruction. 

The CMPEXCHG can be used to implement locking, where spinlocks , e.g. retrying until the zero flag is set, are simplest in design.  

Lockless design increases efficiency by avoiding spinning waiting for a lock .

The java standard library has an implementation of non-blocking concurrent skiplists, based on a paper titled &quot;a pragmatic implementation of non-blocking single-linked lists&quot;. 

The skip list implementation is an extension of the lock-free single-linked list , of which a description follows :-

The '''insert''' operation is :  X -&gt; Y  insert N ,  N -&gt; Y,  X -&gt; N ; expected result is X -&gt; N -&gt; Y . 

A race condition is if M is inserting between X and Y and M completes first , then N completes, so the situation is X -&gt; N -&gt; Y &lt;- M

M is not in the list. The CAS operation avoids this, because a copy of -&gt; Y is checked before updating X -&gt; , against the current value of X -&gt; .

If N gets to update X -&gt;  first, then when M tries to update X -&gt;  , its copy of X -&gt; Y , which it got before doing M -&gt; Y , does not match X -&gt; N , so CAS returns non-zero flag set. The process that tried to insert M then can retry the insertion after X, but now the CAS checks -&gt;N is X's next pointer, so after retry, X-&gt;M-&gt;N-&gt;Y , and neither insertions are lost.

If M updates X-&gt; first, N 's copy of X-&gt;Y does not match X -&gt; M , so the CAS will fail here too, and the above retry of the process inserting N, would have the serialized result of  X -&gt;N -&gt; M -&gt; Y .

The '''delete''' operation depends on a separate 'logical' deletion step, before 'physical' deletion. 

'Logical' deletion involves a CAS change of the next pointer into a 'marked' pointer. The java implementation substitutes with an atomic insertion of a proxy marker node to the next node. 

This prevents future insertions from inserting after a node which has a next pointer 'marked' , making the latter node 'logically' deleted. 

The '''insert''' operation relies on another function , ''search'' , returning &lt;u&gt;2&lt;/u&gt; '''unmarked''' , at the time of the invocation, node pointers : the first pointing to a node , whose next pointer is equal to the second. 

The first node is the node  before the insertion point. 

The ''insert'' CAS operation checks that the current next pointer of the first node, corresponds to the unmarked reference of the second, so will fail 'logically' if the first node's ''next'' pointer has become marked ''after'' the call to the ''search'' function above, because the first node has been concurrently logically deleted.
 
''This meets the aim to prevent a insertion occurring concurrently after a node has been deleted.''

If the insert operation fails the CAS of the previous node's next pointer, the search for the insertion point starts from the '''start of the entire list''' again, since a new unmarked previous node needs to be found, and there are no previous node pointers as the list nodes are singly-linked. 

[[File:CAS insert.png|thumbnail|300px]]

The '''delete''' operation outlined above, also relies on the ''search'' operation returning two ''unmarked'' nodes, and the two CAS operations in delete, one for logical deletion or marking of the second pointer's next pointer, and the other for physical deletion by making the first node's next pointer point to the second node's unmarked next pointer. 

The first CAS of delete happens only after a check that the copy of the original second nodes' next pointer is unmarked, and ensures that only one concurrent delete succeeds which reads the  second node's current next pointer as being unmarked as well. 

The second CAS checks that the previous node hasn't been logically deleted
because its next pointer is not the same as the unmarked pointer to the current second node returned by the search function, so only an active previous node's next pointer is 'physically' updated to a copy of the original unmarked next pointer of the node being deleted ( whose next pointer is already marked by the first CAS).

If the second CAS fails, then the previous node is logically deleted and its next pointer is marked, and so is the current node's next pointer. A call to ''search'' function again, tidies things up, because in endeavouring to find the key of the current node and return adjacent unmarked previous and current pointers, and while doing so, it truncates strings of logically deleted nodes .

==== Lock-free programming issues ====
Starvation could be possible , as failed inserts have to restart from the front of the list. Wait-freedom is a concept where the algorithm has all threads safe from starvation.

The ABA problem exists, where a garbage collector recycles the pointer A , but the address is loaded differently, and the pointer is re-added at a point where a check is done for A by another thread that read A and is doing a CAS to check A has not changed ; the address is the same and is unmarked, but the contents of A has changed.

'''Backtracking''' is a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve an optimization problem. Backtracking is also known as '''depth-first search''' or '''branch and bound'''. By inserting more knowledge of the problem, the search tree can be pruned to avoid considering cases that don't look promising. While backtracking is useful for hard problems to which we do not know more efficient solutions, it is a poor solution for the everyday problems that other techniques are much better at solving.

However, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms can be thought of as optimizations to backtracking, so the general technique behind backtracking is useful for understanding these more advanced concepts. Learning and understanding backtracking techniques first provides a good stepping stone to these more advanced techniques because you won't have to learn several new concepts all at once.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Backtracking Methodology'''&lt;br&gt;
# View picking a solution as a sequence of '''choices'''
# For each choice, consider every '''option''' recursively
# Return the best solution found&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This methodology is generic enough that it can be applied to most problems. However, even when taking care to improve a backtracking algorithm, it will probably still take exponential time rather than polynomial time. Additionally, exact time analysis of backtracking algorithms can be extremely difficult: instead, simpler upperbounds that may not be tight are given.

== Longest Common Subsequence (exhaustive version) ==
Note that the solution to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem discussed in this section is not efficient. However, it is useful for understanding the dynamic programming version of the algorithm that is covered later.

The LCS problem is similar to what the Unix &quot;diff&quot; program does. The diff command in Unix takes two text files, ''A'' and ''B'', as input and outputs the differences line-by-line from ''A'' and ''B''. For example, diff can show you that lines missing from ''A'' have been added to ''B'', and lines present in ''A'' have been removed from ''B''. The goal is to get a list of additions and removals that could be used to transform ''A'' to ''B''. An overly conservative solution to the problem would say that all lines from ''A'' were removed, and that all lines from ''B'' were added. While this would solve the problem in a crude sense, we are concerned with the minimal number of additions and removals to achieve a correct transformation. Consider how you may implement a solution to this problem yourself.

The LCS problem, instead of dealing with lines in text files, is concerned with finding common items between two different arrays. For example,

 let ''a'' := array {&quot;The&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;square&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;corners&quot;}
 let ''b'' := array {&quot;The&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;form&quot;}

We want to find the longest subsequence possible of items that are found in both ''a'' and ''b'' in the same order. The LCS of ''a'' and ''b'' is

:&quot;The&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, &quot;has&quot;, &quot;no&quot;

Now consider two more sequences:

 let ''c'' := array {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}
 let ''d'' := array {1, 2, 3, 32, 8}

Here, there are two longest common subsequences of ''c'' and ''d'':

:1, 2, 32; and
:1, 2, 8

Note that

:1, 2, 32, 8

is ''not'' a common subsequence, because it is only a valid subsequence of ''d'' and not ''c'' (because ''c'' has 8 before the 32). Thus, we can conclude that for some cases, solutions to the LCS problem are not unique. If we had more information about the sequences available we might prefer one subsequence to another: for example, if the sequences were lines of text in computer programs, we might choose the subsequences that would keep function definitions or paired comment delimiters intact (instead of choosing delimiters that were not paired in the syntax).

On the top level, our problem is to implement the following function

 // ''lcs -- returns the longest common subsequence of a and b''
 function '''lcs'''(array ''a'', array ''b''): array

which takes in two arrays as input and outputs the subsequence array.

How do you solve this problem? You could start by noticing that if the two sequences start with the same word, then the longest common subsequence always contains that word. You can automatically put that word on your list, and you would have just reduced the problem to finding the longest common subset of the rest of the two lists.  Thus, the problem was made smaller, which is good because it shows progress was made.

But if the two lists do not begin with the same word, then one, or both, of the first element in ''a'' or the first element in ''b'' do not belong in the longest common subsequence. But yet, one of them might be. How do you determine which one, if any, to add?

The solution can be thought in terms of the back tracking methodology: Try it both ways and see!  Either way, the two sub-problems are manipulating smaller lists, so you know that the recursion will eventually terminate. Whichever trial results in the longer common subsequence is the winner.

Instead of &quot;throwing it away&quot; by deleting the item from the array we use array slices. For example, the slice

:''a''[1,..,5]

represents the elements

:{''a''[1], ''a''[2], ''a''[3], ''a''[4], ''a''[5]}

of the array as an array itself. If your language doesn't support slices you'll have to pass beginning and/or ending indices along with the full array. Here, the slices are only of the form

:''a''[1,..]

which, when using 0 as the index to the first element in the array, results in an array slice that doesn't have the 0th element. (Thus, a non-sliced version of this algorithm would only need to pass the beginning valid index around instead, and that value would have to be subtracted from the complete array's length to get the pseudo-slice's length.)

 // ''lcs -- returns the longest common subsequence of a and b''
 function '''lcs'''(array ''a'', array ''b''): array
   if ''a''.length == 0 OR ''b''.length == 0:
     ''// if we're at the end of either list, then the lcs is empty
     
     return new array {}
   else-if ''a''[0] == ''b''[0]:
     ''// if the start element is the same in both, then it is on the lcs,''
     ''// so we just recurse on the remainder of both lists.''
     
     return append(new array {''a''[0]}, '''lcs'''(''a''[1,..], ''b''[1,..]))
   else
     ''// we don't know which list we should discard from. Try both ways,''
     ''// pick whichever is better.''
     
     let ''discard_a'' := '''lcs'''(''a''[1,..], ''b'')
     let ''discard_b'' := '''lcs'''(''a'', ''b''[1,..])
     
     if ''discard_a''.length &gt; ''discard_b''.length:
       let ''result'' := ''discard_a''
     else
       let ''result'' := ''discard_b''
     fi
     return ''result''
   fi
 end

If you've already found something &quot;better&quot; and you're on a branch that will never be as good as the one you already saw, you can terminate that branch early. (Example to use: sum of numbers beginning with 1 2, and then each number following is a sum of any of the numbers plus the last number. Show performance improvements.)

'''Dynamic programming''' can be thought of as an optimization technique for particular classes of backtracking algorithms where subproblems are repeatedly solved. Note that the term ''dynamic'' in dynamic programming should not be confused with dynamic programming languages, like Scheme or Lisp. Nor should the term ''programming'' be confused with the act of writing computer programs. In the context of algorithms, dynamic programming always refers to the technique of filling in a table with values computed from other table values. (It's dynamic because the values in the table are filled in by the algorithm based on other values of the table, and it's programming in the sense of setting things in a table, like how television programming is concerned with when to broadcast what shows.)

== Fibonacci Numbers ==
Before presenting the dynamic programming technique, it will be useful to first show a related technique, called '''memoization''', on a toy example: The Fibonacci numbers. What we want is a routine to compute the ''n''th Fibonacci number:

 ''// fib -- compute Fibonacci(n)''
 function '''fib'''(integer ''n''): integer

By definition, the ''n''th Fibonacci number, denoted &lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_n = \textrm{F}_{n-1} + \textrm{F}_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

How would one create a good algorithm for finding the nth Fibonacci-number? Let's begin with the naive algorithm, which codes the mathematical definition:

 ''// fib -- compute Fibonacci(n)''
 function '''fib'''(integer ''n''): integer
   assert (n &gt;= 0)
   if ''n'' == 0: return 0 fi
   if ''n'' == 1: return 1 fi
   
   return '''fib'''(''n'' - 1) + '''fib'''(''n'' - 2)

Note that this is a toy example because there is already a mathematically closed form for &lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_n&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;F(n) = {\phi^n - (1 -\phi)^{n} \over \sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;

where: 

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = {1 + \sqrt{5} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

This latter equation is known as the [[w:golden_ratio|Golden Ratio]]. Thus, a program could efficiently calculate &lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; for even very large ''n''. However, it's instructive to understand what's so inefficient about the current algorithm.

To analyze the running time of &lt;tt&gt;fib&lt;/tt&gt; we should look at a call tree for something even as small as the sixth Fibonacci number:

[[Image:Algorithms-F6CallTree.png]]

Every leaf of the call tree has the value 0 or 1, and the sum of these values is the final result. So, for any ''n,'' the number of leaves in the call tree is actually &lt;math&gt;\textrm{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; itself! The closed form thus tells us that the number of leaves in &lt;tt&gt;'''fib'''(''n'')&lt;/tt&gt; is approximately equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n\approx 1.618^n = 2^{\lg (1.618^n)} = 2^{n \lg (1.618)} \approx 2^{0.69 n}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note the algebraic manipulation used above to make the base of the exponent the number 2.) This means that there are far too many leaves, particularly considering the repeated patterns found in the call tree above.

One optimization we can make is to save a result in a table once it's already been computed, so that the same result needs to be computed only once. The optimization process is called memoization and conforms to the following methodology:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Memoization Methodology'''&lt;br&gt;
# Start with a backtracking algorithm
# Look up the problem in a table; if there's a valid entry for it, return that value
# Otherwise, compute the problem recursively, and then store the result in the table before returning the value&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Consider the solution presented in the backtracking chapter for the Longest Common Subsequence problem. In the execution of that algorithm, many common subproblems were computed repeatedly. As an optimization, we can compute these subproblems once and then store the result to read back later. A recursive memoization algorithm can be turned &quot;bottom-up&quot; into an iterative algorithm that fills in a table of solutions to subproblems. Some of the subproblems solved might not be needed by the end result (and that is where dynamic programming differs from memoization), but dynamic programming can be very efficient because the iterative version can better use the cache and have less call overhead. Asymptotically, dynamic programming and memoization have the same complexity.

So how would a fibonacci program using memoization work? Consider the following program (''f''[''n''] contains the ''n''th Fibonacci-number if has been calculated, -1 otherwise):

 function '''fib'''(integer ''n''): integer
   if ''n'' == 0 '''or''' n == 1:
     return ''n''
   else-if ''f''[''n''] != -1:
     return ''f''[''n'']
   else
     ''f''[''n''] = '''fib'''(''n'' - 1) + '''fib'''(''n'' - 2)
     return ''f''[''n'']
   fi
 end
{{Algorithms/Sample|[[Ada_Programming/Algorithms#Cached_Implementation|Ada]]}}

The code should be pretty obvious. If the value of fib(n) already has been calculated it's stored in f[n] and then returned instead of calculating it again. That means all the copies of the sub-call trees are removed from the calculation.

[[Image:Algorithms-F6CallTreeMemoized.PNG]]

The values in the blue boxes are values that already have been calculated and the calls can thus be skipped. It is thus a lot faster than the straight-forward recursive algorithm. Since every value less than n is calculated once, and only once, the first time you execute it, the asymptotic running time is &lt;math&gt;O (n)&lt;/math&gt;. Any other calls to it will take &lt;math&gt;O (1)&lt;/math&gt; since the values have been precalculated (assuming each subsequent call's argument is less than n). 

The algorithm does consume a lot of memory. When we calculate fib(''n''), the values fib(0) to fib(n) are stored in main memory. Can this be improved? Yes it can, although the &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; running time of subsequent calls are obviously lost since the values aren't stored. Since the value of fib(''n'') only depends on fib(''n-1'') and fib(''n-2'') we can discard the other values by going bottom-up. If we want to calculate fib(''n''), we first calculate fib(2) = fib(0) + fib(1). Then we can calculate fib(3) by adding fib(1) and fib(2). After that, fib(0) and fib(1) can be discarded, since we don't need them to calculate any more values. From fib(2) and fib(3) we calculate fib(4) and discard fib(2), then we calculate fib(5) and discard fib(3), etc. etc. The code goes something like this:

 function '''fib'''(integer ''n''): integer
   if ''n'' == 0 '''or''' n == 1:
     return ''n''
   fi
 
   let ''u'' := 0
   let ''v'' := 1
 
   for ''i'' := 2 to ''n'':
     let ''t'' := ''u'' + ''v''
     ''u'' := ''v''
     ''v'' := ''t''
   repeat
   
   return ''v''
 end
{{Algorithms/Sample|[[Ada_Programming/Algorithms#Memory_Optimized_Implementation|Ada]]}}

We can modify the code to store the values in an array for subsequent calls, but the point is that we don't ''have'' to. This method is typical for dynamic programming. First we identify what subproblems need to be solved in order to solve the entire problem, and then we calculate the values bottom-up using an iterative process.

== Longest Common Subsequence (DP version) ==
This will remind us of the backtracking version and then improve it via memoization. Finally, the recursive algorithm will be made iterative and be full-fledged DP.
[TODO: write this section]

== Matrix Chain Multiplication ==
Suppose that you need to multiply a series of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; matrices &lt;math&gt;M_1,\ldots, M_n&lt;/math&gt; together to form a product matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P = M_1\cdot M_2 \cdots M_{n-1}\cdot M_n&lt;/math&gt;

This will require &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; multiplications, but what is the fastest way we can form this product? Matrix multiplication is associative, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;(A\cdot B)\cdot C = A\cdot (B\cdot C)&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;A, B, C&lt;/math&gt;, and so we have some choice in what multiplication we perform first. (Note that matrix multiplication is ''not'' commutative, that is, it does not hold in general that &lt;math&gt;A\cdot B = B\cdot A&lt;/math&gt;.)

Because you can only multiply two matrices at a time the product &lt;math&gt;M_1\cdot M_2\cdot M_3\cdot M_4&lt;/math&gt; can be paranthesized in these ways:

:&lt;math&gt;((M_1 M_2) M_3) M_4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 (M_2 M_3)) M_4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 ((M_2 M_3) M_4)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 M_2) (M_3 M_4)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 (M_2 (M_3 M_4))&lt;/math&gt;

Two matrices &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; can be multiplied if the number of columns in &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; equals the number of rows in &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;. The number of rows in their product will equal the number rows in &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and the number of columns will equal the number of columns in &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if the dimensions of &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;b \times c&lt;/math&gt; their product will have dimensions &lt;math&gt;a \times c&lt;/math&gt;.

To multiply two matrices with each other we use a function called matrix-multiply that takes two matrices and returns their product. We will leave implementation of this function alone for the moment as it is not the focus of this chapter (how to multiply two matrices in the fastest way has been under intensive study for several years [TODO: propose this topic for the ''Advanced'' book]). The time this function takes to multiply two matrices of size &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \times c&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the number of scalar multiplications, which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;a b c&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, paranthezation matters: Say that we have three matrices &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_3&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;5 \times 100&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;100 \times 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_3&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;100 \times 50&lt;/math&gt;. Let's paranthezise them in the two possible ways and see which way requires the least amount of multiplications. The two ways are

:&lt;math&gt;((M_1 M_2) M_3)&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 (M_2 M_3))&lt;/math&gt;.

To form the product in the first way requires 75000 scalar multiplications (5*100*100=50000 to form product &lt;math&gt;(M_1 M_2)&lt;/math&gt; and another 5*100*50=25000 for the last multiplications.) This might seem like a lot, but in comparison to the 525000 scalar multiplications required by the second parenthesization (50*100*100=500000 plus 5*50*100=25000) it is miniscule! You can see why determining the parenthesization is important: imagine what would happen if we needed to multiply 50 matrices!

=== Forming a Recursive Solution ===
Note that we concentrate on finding a how many scalar multiplications are needed instead of the actual order. This is because once we have found a working algorithm to find the amount it is trivial to create an algorithm for the actual parenthesization. It will, however, be discussed in the end.

So how would an algorithm for the optimum parenthesization look? By the chapter title you might expect that a dynamic programming method is in order (not to give the answer away or anything). So how would a dynamic programming method work? Because dynamic programming algorithms are based on optimal substructure, what would the optimal substructure in this problem be?

Suppose that the optimal way to parenthesize 
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 M_2 \dots M_n&lt;/math&gt;
splits the product at &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 M_2 \dots M_k)(M_{k+1} M_{k+2} \dots M_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the optimal solution contains the optimal solutions to the two subproblems
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 \dots M_k)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_{k+1} \dots M_n)&lt;/math&gt;
That is, just in accordance with the fundamental principle of dynamic programming, the solution to the problem depends on the solution of smaller sub-problems.

Let's say that it takes &lt;math&gt;c(n)&lt;/math&gt; scalar multiplications to multiply matrices &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of scalar multiplications to be performed in an optimal parenthesization of the matrices &lt;math&gt;M_m \dots M_n&lt;/math&gt;. The definition of &lt;math&gt;f(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; is the first step toward a solution.

When &lt;math&gt;n-m=1&lt;/math&gt;, the formulation is trivial; it is just &lt;math&gt;c(m)&lt;/math&gt;. But what is it when the distance is larger? Using the observation above, we can derive a formulation. Suppose an optimal solution to the problem divides the matrices at matrices k and k+1 (i.e. &lt;math&gt;(M_m \dots M_k)(M_{k+1} \dots M_n)&lt;/math&gt;) then the number of scalar multiplications are.

:&lt;math&gt;f(m,k) + f(k+1,n) + c(k)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the amount of time to form the first product, the amount of time it takes to form the second product, and the amount of time it takes to multiply them together. But what is this optimal value k? The answer is, of course, the value that makes the above formula assume its minimum value. We can thus form the complete definition for the function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(m,n) = \begin{cases} \min_{m \le k &lt; n}f(m,k) + f(k+1,n) + c(k) &amp; \mbox{if } n-m&gt;1 \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if } n=m\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

A straight-forward recursive solution to this would look something like this ''(the language is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikicode Wikicode])'':

 function '''f'''(''m'', ''n'') {
 
     if ''m'' == ''n''
         return 0
 
     let ''minCost'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
 
     for ''k'' := ''m'' to ''n'' - 1 {
         v := '''f'''(''m'', ''k'') + '''f'''(''k'' + 1, ''n'') + ''c''(''k'')
         if ''v'' &lt; ''minCost''
             ''minCost'' := ''v''
     }
     return ''minCost''
 }

This rather simple solution is, unfortunately, not a very good one. It spends mountains of time recomputing data and its running time is exponential.

Using the same adaptation as above we get:

 function '''f'''(''m'', ''n'') {
 
     if ''m'' == ''n''
         return 0
 
     else-if ''f''[''m,n''] != -1:
       return ''f''[''m,n'']
     fi
 
     let ''minCost'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
 
     for ''k'' := ''m'' to ''n'' - 1 {
         v := '''f'''(''m'', ''k'') + '''f'''(''k'' + 1, ''n'') + ''c''(''k'')
         if ''v'' &lt; ''minCost''
             ''minCost'' := ''v''
     }
     ''f''[''m,n'']=minCost
     return ''minCost''
 }

In the backtracking algorithms we looked at, we saw algorithms that found decision points and recursed over all options from that decision point. A '''greedy algorithm''' can be thought of as a backtracking algorithm where at each decision point &quot;the best&quot; option is already known and thus can be picked without having to recurse over any of the alternative options.

The name &quot;greedy&quot; comes from the fact that the algorithms make decisions based on a single criterion, instead of a global analysis that would take into account the decision's effect on further steps. As we will see, such a backtracking analysis will be unnecessary in the case of greedy algorithms, so it is not greedy in the sense of causing harm for only short-term gain.

Unlike backtracking algorithms, greedy algorithms can't be made for every problem. Not every problem is &quot;solvable&quot; using greedy algorithms. Viewing the finding solution to an optimization problem as a hill climbing problem greedy algorithms can be used for only those hills where at every point taking the steepest step would lead to the peak always.

Greedy algorithms tend to be very efficient and can be implemented in a relatively straightforward fashion. Many a times in O(n) complexity as there would be a single choice at every point. However, most attempts at creating a correct greedy algorithm fail unless a precise proof of the algorithm's correctness is first demonstrated. When a greedy strategy fails to produce optimal results on all inputs, we instead refer to it as a heuristic instead of an algorithm. Heuristics can be useful when speed is more important than exact results (for example, when &quot;good enough&quot; results are sufficient).

== Event Scheduling Problem ==
The first problem we'll look at that can be solved with a greedy algorithm is the event scheduling problem. We are given a set of events that have a start time and finish time, and we need to produce a subset of these events such that no events intersect each other (that is, having overlapping times), and that we have the maximum number of events scheduled as possible.

Here is a formal statement of the problem:
:''Input'': ''events'': a set of intervals &lt;math&gt;(s_i, f_i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the start time, and &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the finish time.
:''Solution'': A subset ''S'' of ''Events''.
:''Constraint'': No events can intersect (start time exclusive). That is, for all intervals &lt;math&gt;i=(s_i, f_i), j=(s_j, f_j)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;s_i &lt; s_j&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;f_i\le s_j&lt;/math&gt;.
:''Objective'': Maximize the number of scheduled events, i.e. maximize the size of the set ''S''.

We first begin with a backtracking solution to the problem:

 ''// event-schedule -- schedule as many non-conflicting events as possible''
 function '''event-schedule'''(''events'' array of ''s''[1..''n''], ''j''[1..''n'']): set
   if ''n'' == 0: return &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; fi
   if ''n'' == 1: return {''events''[1]} fi
   let ''event'' := ''events''[1]
   let ''S1'' := union('''event-schedule'''(''events'' - set of conflicting events), ''event'')
   let ''S2'' := '''event-schedule'''(''events'' - {''event''})
   if ''S1''.size() &gt;= ''S2''.size():
     return ''S1''
   else
     return ''S2''
   fi
 end

The above algorithm will faithfully find the largest set of non-conflicting events. It brushes aside details of how the set

: ''events'' - set of conflicting events

is computed, but it would require &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time. Because the algorithm makes two recursive calls on itself, each with an argument of size &lt;math&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, and because removing conflicts takes linear time, a recurrence for the time this algorithm takes is:

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 2\cdot T(n - 1) + O(n)&lt;/math&gt;

which is &lt;math&gt;O(2^{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

{{TODO|a tighter bound is possible|Algorithms}}

But suppose instead of picking just the first element in the array we used some other criterion. The aim is to just pick the &quot;right&quot; one so that we wouldn't need two recursive calls. First, let's consider the greedy strategy of picking the shortest events first, until we can add no more events without conflicts. The idea here is that the shortest events would likely interfere less than other events.

There are scenarios were picking the shortest event first produces the optimal result. However, here's a scenario where that strategy is sub-optimal:

[[Image:AlgorithmsShortestFirst.png]]

Above, the optimal solution is to pick event A and C, instead of just B alone. Perhaps instead of the shortest event we should pick the events that have the least number of conflicts. This strategy seems more direct, but it fails in this scenario:

[[Image:AlgorithmsLeastConflicts.png]]

Above, we can maximize the number of events by picking A, B, C, D, and E. However, the events with the least conflicts are 6, 2 and 7, 3. But picking one of 6, 2 and one of 7, 3 means that we cannot pick B, C and D, which includes three events instead of just two.

== Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm ==
With two (high-level, pseudocode) transformations, Dijsktra's algorithm can be derived from the much less efficient backtracking algorithm. The trick here is to prove the transformations maintain correctness, but that's the whole insight into Dijkstra's algorithm anyway. [TODO: important to note the paradox that to solve this problem it's easier to solve a more-general version. That is, shortest path from s to all nodes, not just to t. Worthy of its own colored box.]

To see the workings of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, take an example:

There is a start and end node,  with 2 paths between them ; one path has cost 30 on first hop, then 10 on last hop to the target node, with total cost 40. Another path cost 10 on first hop, 10 on second hop, and 40 on last hop, with total cost 60. 

The start node is given distance zero so it can be at the front of a shortest distance queue, all the other nodes are given infinity or a large number e.g. 32767 . 

This makes the start node the first current node in the queue.

With each iteration, the current node is the first node of a shortest path queue.  It looks at all nodes adjacent to the current node;

For the case of the start node,  in the first path it will find a node of distance 30, and in the second path, an adjacent node of distance 10. The current nodes distance , which is zero at the beginning, is added to distances of the adjacent nodes, and the distances from the start node of each node are updated , so the nodes will be 30+0 = 30 in the 1st path , and 10+0=10  in the 2nd path. 

Importantly, also updated is a previous pointer attribute for each node, so each node will point back to the current node, which is the start node for these two nodes. 

Each node's priority is updated in the priority queue using the new distance.

That ends one iteration. The current node was removed from the queue before examining its adjacent nodes. 

In the next iteration, the front of the queue will be the node in the second path of distance 10, and it has only one adjacent node of distance 10, and that adjacent node will distance will be updated from 32767 to 10 (the current node distance) + 10 ( the distance from the current node) = 20. 

In the next iteration, the second path node of cost 20 will be examined, and it has one adjacent hop of 40 to the target node, and the target
nodes distance is updated from 32767 to 20 + 40 = 60 . The target node has its priority updated.

In the next iteration, the shortest path node will be the first path node of  cost 30, and the target node has not been yet removed from the queue.
It is also adjacent to the target node, with the total distance cost of 30 + 10 = 40. 

Since 40 is less than 60, the previous calculated distance of the target node, the target node distance is updated to 40, and the previous pointer of the target node is updated to the node on the first path. 

In the final iteration, the shortest path node is the target node, and the loop exits. 

Looking at the previous pointers starting with the target node,  a shortest path can be reverse constructed as a list to the start node.

Given the above example, what kind of data structures are needed for the nodes and the algorithm ?

== Minimum spanning tree ==
Greedily looking for the minimum weight edges ; this could be achieved with sorting edges into a list in ascending weight. 
Two well known algorithms are Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm. Kruskal selects the next minimum weight edge that has the condition that no cycle is formed in the resulting updated graph. Prim's algorithm selects a minimum edge that has the condition that only one edge is connected to the tree. 
For both the algorithms, it looks that most work will be done verifying an examined edge fits the primary condition. 
In Kruskal's, a search and mark technique would have to be done on the candidate edge. This will result in a search of any connected edges already selected, and if a marked edge is encountered, than a cycle has been formed.
In Prim's algorithm, the candidate edge would be compared to the list of currently selected edges, which could be keyed on vertex number in a symbol table, and if both end vertexes are found, then the candidate edge is rejected.

'''Hill climbing''' is a technique for certain classes of optimization problems. The idea is to start with a sub-optimal solution to a problem (i.e., ''start at the base of a hill'') and then repeatedly improve the solution (''walk up the hill'') until some condition is maximized (''the top of the hill is reached'').

# Construct a sub-optimal solution that meets the constraints of the problem
# Take the solution and make an improvement upon it
# Repeatedly improve the solution until no more improvements are necessary/possible&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

One of the most popular hill-climbing problems is the network flow problem. Although network flow may sound somewhat specific it is important because it has high expressive power: for example, many algorithmic problems encountered in practice can actually be considered special cases of network flow. After covering a simple example of the hill-climbing approach for a numerical problem we cover network flow and then present examples of applications of network flow.

== Newton's Root Finding Method ==
[[Image:Newton_iteration.png|right|thumb|300px|An illustration of Newton's method: The zero of the ''f(x)'' function is at ''x''. We see that the guess ''x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a better guess than ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' because it is closer to ''x''. (''from [[w:Newton's method|Wikipedia]]'')]] &lt;!-- Mathematical formulas set as HTML - otherwise picture caption will not work. --&gt;
Newton's Root Finding Method is a three-centuries-old algorithm for finding numerical approximations to roots of a function (that is a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero), starting from an initial guess. You need to know the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; and its first derivative &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; for this algorithm. The idea is the following: In the vicinity of the initial guess &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; we can form the Taylor expansion of the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(x_0+\epsilon)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\approx f(x_0)+\epsilon f'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;+\frac{\epsilon^2}{2} f''(x_0)+...&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- Function split up to &quot;wrap&quot; for smaller screens --&gt;

which gives a good approximation to the function near &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. Taking only the first two terms on the right hand side, setting them equal to zero, and solving for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

which we can use to construct a better solution 

:&lt;math&gt;x_1=x_0+\epsilon=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This new solution can be the starting point for applying the same procedure again. Thus, in general a better approximation can be constructed by repeatedly applying

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

As shown in the illustration, this is nothing else but the construction of the zero from the tangent at the initial guessing point. In general, Newton's root finding method converges quadratically, except when the first derivative of the solution &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=0\,&lt;/math&gt; vanishes at the root.

Coming back to the &quot;Hill climbing&quot; analogy, we could apply Newton's root finding method not to the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;, but to its first derivative &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;, that is look for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(x)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;. This would give the extremal positions of the function, its maxima and minima. Starting Newton's method close enough to a maximum this way, we climb the hill.

==== Example application of Newton's method ====
The net present value function is a function of time, an interest rate, and a series of cash flows. A related function is Internal Rate of Return.
The formula for each period is (CF&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x (1+ i/100) &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; , and this will give a polynomial function which is the total cash flow, and  equals zero when the interest rate equals the IRR. In using Newton's method, x is the interest rate, and y is the total cash flow, and the method will use the derivative function of the polynomial to find the slope of the graph at a given interest rate (x-value), which will give the x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; , or a better interest rate to try in the next iteration to find the target x where y ( the total returns) is zero.



Instead of regarding continuous functions, the hill-climbing method can also be applied to discrete networks.

== Network Flow ==
Suppose you have a directed graph (possibly with cycles) with one vertex labeled as the source and another vertex labeled as the destination or the &quot;sink&quot;. The source vertex only has edges coming out of it, with no edges going into it. Similarly, the destination vertex only has edges going into it, with no edges coming out of it. We can assume that the graph fully connected with no dead-ends; i.e., for every vertex (except the source and the sink), there is at least one edge going into the vertex and one edge going out of it.

We assign a &quot;capacity&quot; to each edge, and initially we'll consider only integral-valued capacities. The following graph meets our requirements, where &quot;s&quot; is the source and &quot;t&quot; is the destination:

[[Image:Algorithms-NetFlow1.png]]

We'd like now to imagine that we have some series of inputs arriving at the source that we want to carry on the edges over to the sink. The number of units we can send on an edge at a time must be less than or equal to the edge's capacity. You can think of the vertices as cities and the edges as roads between the cities and we want to send as many cars from the source city to the destination city as possible. The constraint is that we cannot send more cars down a road than its capacity can handle.

'''The goal of network flow''' is to send as much traffic from &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as each street can bear.

To organize the traffic routes, we can build a list of different paths from city &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to city &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Each path has a carrying capacity equal to the smallest capacity value for any edge on the path; for example, consider the following path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;:

[[Image:Algorithms-NetFlow2.png]]

Even though the final edge of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has a capacity of 8, that edge only has one car traveling on it because the edge before it only has a capacity of 1 (thus, that edge is at full capacity). After using this path, we can compute the '''residual graph''' by subtracting 1 from the capacity of each edge:

[[Image:Algorithms-NetFlow3.png]]

(We subtracted 1 from the capacity of each edge in &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; because 1 was the carrying capacity of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.) We can say that path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has a flow of 1. Formally, a '''flow''' is an assignment &lt;math&gt;f(e)&lt;/math&gt; of values to the set of edges in the graph &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:1. &lt;math&gt;\forall e\in E: f(e)\in\R&lt;/math&gt;
:2. &lt;math&gt;\forall (u,v)\in E: f((u,v)) = -f((v,u))&lt;/math&gt;
:3. &lt;math&gt;\forall u\in V, u\ne s,t: \sum_{v\in V}f(u,v) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:4. &lt;math&gt;\forall e\in E: f(e)\le c(e)&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the source node and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the sink node, and &lt;math&gt;c(e)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is the capacity of edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. We define the value of a flow &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Value}(f) = \sum_{v\in V} f((s, v))&lt;/math&gt;
The goal of network flow is to find an &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Value}(f)&lt;/math&gt; is maximal. To be maximal means that there is no other flow assignment that obeys the constraints 1-4 that would have a higher value. The traffic example can describe what the four flow constraints mean:

# &lt;math&gt;\forall e\in E: f(e)\in\R&lt;/math&gt;. This rule simply defines a flow to be a function from edges in the graph to real numbers. The function is defined for every edge in the graph. You could also consider the &quot;function&quot; to simply be a mapping: Every edge can be an index into an array and the value of the array at an edge is the value of the flow function at that edge.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall (u,v)\in E: f((u,v)) = -f((v,u))&lt;/math&gt;. This rule says that if there is some traffic flowing from node ''u'' to node ''v'' then there should be considered negative that amount flowing from ''v'' to ''u''. For example, if two cars are flowing from city ''u'' to city ''v'', then negative two cars are going in the other direction. Similarly, if three cars are going from city ''u'' to city ''v'' and two cars are going city ''v'' to city ''u'' then the net effect is the same as if one car was going from city ''u'' to city ''v'' and no cars are going from city ''v'' to city ''u''.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall u\in V, u\ne s,t: \sum_{v\in V}f(u,v) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This rule says that the net flow (except for the source and the destination) should be neutral. That is, you won't ever have more cars going into a city than you would have coming out of the city. New cars can only come from the source, and cars can only be stored in the destination. Similarly, whatever flows out of ''s'' must eventually flow into ''t''. Note that if a city has three cars coming into it, it could send two cars to one city and the remaining car to a different city. Also, a city might have cars coming into it from multiple sources (although all are ultimately from city ''s'').
# &lt;math&gt;\forall e\in E: f(e)\le c(e)&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm ==
The following algorithm computes the maximal flow for a given graph with non-negative capacities. What the algorithm does can be easy to understand, but it's non-trivial to show that it terminates and provides an optimal solution.

 function '''net-flow'''(graph (''V'', ''E''), node ''s'', node ''t'', cost ''c''): flow
   initialize ''f''(''e'') := 0 for all ''e'' in ''E''
   loop while not ''done''
     for all ''e'' in ''E'':                         ''// compute residual capacities''
       let ''cf''(''e'') := ''c''(''e'') - ''f''(''e'')
     repeat
     
     let ''Gf'' := (''V'', {''e'' : ''e'' in ''E'' and ''cf''(''e'') &gt; 0})
 
     find a path ''p'' from ''s'' to ''t'' in ''Gf''         ''// e.g., use depth first search''
     if no path ''p'' exists: signal ''done''
 
     let ''path-capacities'' := map(''p'', ''cf'')       ''// a path is a set of edges''
     let ''m'' := min-val-of(''path-capacities'')    ''// smallest residual capacity of p''
     for all (''u'', ''v'') in ''p'':                    ''// maintain flow constraints''
       ''f''((''u'', ''v'')) := ''f''((''u'', ''v'')) + ''m''
       ''f''((''v'', ''u'')) := ''f''((''v'', ''u'')) - ''m''
     repeat
   repeat
 end

{{TODO|explain, hopefully using pictures, what the algorithm is doing. Explain its run time. Prove that it is optimal. Show an optimization, by &quot;remembering&quot; the Depth First Search to cut down the time the algorithm takes.|Algorithms}}

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm uses repeated calls to  Breadth-First Search ( use a queue to schedule the children of a node to become the current node). Breadth-First Search increments the length of each path +1 so that the first path to get to the destination, the shortest path, will be the first off the queue. This is in contrast with using a Stack, which is Depth-First Search, and will come up with *any* path to the target, with the &quot;descendants&quot; of current node examined, but not necessarily the shortest.
* In one search, a path from source to target is found. All nodes are made unmarked at the beginning of a new search. Seen nodes are &quot;marked&quot; , and not searched again if encountered again. Eventually, all reachable nodes will have been scheduled on the queue , and no more unmarked nodes can be reached off the last the node on the queue. 
* During the search, nodes scheduled have the finding &quot;edge&quot; (consisting of the current node , the found node, a current flow, and a total capacity in the direction first to second node),  recorded.
* This allows finding a reverse path from the target node once reached, to the start node. Once a path is found, the edges are examined to find the edge with the minimum remaining capacity, and this becomes the flow that will result along this path , and this quantity is removed from the remaining capacity of each edge along the path. At the &quot;bottleneck&quot; edge with the minimum remaining capacity, no more flow will be possible, in the forward direction, but still possible in the backward direction.
* This process of BFS for a path to the target node, filling up the path to the bottleneck edge's residual capacity, is repeated, until BFS cannot find a path to the target node ( the node is not reached because all sequences of edges leading to the target have had their bottleneck edges filled). Hence memory of the side effects of previous paths found, is recorded in the flows of the edges, and affect the results of future searches.
* An important property of maximal flow is that flow can occur in the backward direction of an edge, and the residual capacity in the backward direction is the current flow in the foward direction. Normally, the residual capacity in the forward direction of an edge is the initial capacity less forward flow. Intuitively, this allows more options for maximizing flow as earlier augmenting paths block off shorter paths.
* On termination, the algorithm will retain the marked and unmarked states of the results of the last BFS.
* the minimum cut state is the two sets of marked and unmarked nodes formed from the last unsuccessful BFS starting from the start node, and not marking the target the node. The start node belongs to one side of the cut, and the target node belongs to the other. Arbitrarily, being &quot;in Cut&quot; means being on the start side, or being a marked node. Recall how are a node comes to be marked, given an edge with a flow and a residual capacity.
==== Example application of Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow/ minimum cut ====
An example of application of Ford-Fulkerson is in baseball season elimination.  The question is whether the team can possibly win the whole season by exceeding some combination of wins of the other teams. 

The idea is that a flow graph is set up with teams not being able to exceed the number of total wins which a target team can maximally win for the entire season.
There are game nodes whose edges represent the number of remaining matches between two teams, and each game node outflows to two team nodes, via edges that will not limit forward flow; team nodes receive edges from all games they participate. Then outflow edges with win limiting capacity flow to the virtual target node. In a maximal flow state where the target node's total wins will exceed some combination of wins of the other teams, the penultimate depth-first search will cutoff the start node from the rest of the graph, because no flow will be possible to any of the game nodes, as a result of the penultimate depth-first search (recall what happens to the flow , in the second part of the algorithm after finding the path). This is because in seeking the maximal flow of each path, the game edges' capacities will be maximally drained by the win-limit edges further along the path, and any residual game capacity means there are more games to be played that will make at least one team overtake the target teams' maximal wins. If a team node is in the minimum cut, then there is an edge with residual capacity leading to the team, which means what , given the previous statements? What do the set of teams found in a minimum cut represent ( hint: consider the game node edge) ?

==== Example Maximum bipartite matching ( intern matching ) ====
This matching problem doesn't include preference weightings. A set of companies offers jobs which are made into one big set , and interns apply to  companies for specific jobs. The applications are edges with a weight of 1. To convert the bipartite matching problem to a maximum flow problem, virtual vertexes s and t are created , which have weighted 1 edges from s to all interns, and from  all jobs to t. Then the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used to sequentially saturate 1 capacity edges from the graph, by augmenting found paths. 
It may happen that a intermediate state is reached where left over interns and jobs are unmatched, but backtracking along reverse edges which have residual capacity = forward flow = 1, along longer paths that occur later during breadth-first search, will negate previous suboptimal augmenting paths, and provide further search options for matching, and will terminate only when maximal flow or maximum matching is reached.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Soil Science''' ==
 
Soil Science encompasses many aspects of soils study such as the disciplines of soil physics, soil chemistry, soil classification, soil microbiology, etc.  One of these studies is ''pedology''.  Pedology is the study of soils in a three dimensional context in their natural setting across the landscape in terms of origins, morphology (forms), classifications, characteristics or attributes, profile or cross-section, surface and internal water relations, geology, plant ecology, etc. and interpretations for use and management. 

Most soils develop from weathered mineral geologic materials and usually include some organic materials in their upper part. This is called the [[wikipedia:en: O horizon|O horizon]], and it is composed of organic material, generally not considered topsoil, but leaf litter and muck. The rock that the mineral part of the soil originates from is called the parent material.  Through the further influence of the soil-forming processes of additions, removals, transfers and transformations the nature of the parent materials are altered to the extent that they become soils.  The soil-forming processes are controlled by the soil forming factors of parent material, climate, living organisms, relief, and time.  Thus the similarity or contrast of soils from place to place reflects the similarity or contrasts of the soil-forming processes and factors.

The primary convention for naming soils is to select a named  geographic feature in the vicinity where the soil was first recognized and identified as a new soil, e.g: the Dunkirk soil series for the village of Dunkirk near Lake Erie, NY.  All soils found to have closely similar attributes are classified as Dunkirk wherever they are found.  That distribution can be more localized or it can be somewhat more extensive.

The description of the soil usually identifies attributes such as pH (degree of alkalinity or acidity), maturity (stage of pedogenic development), texture, consistence, color, gravel content and type, drainage class, and other soil features.  

The United States and other nations have soil maps that show the soils in relation to one another as they occur across the landscape.  On these maps each soil is characteristically related to a unique landscape position.  Thus, the pattern of distribution and the location and extent of the soil type can be comprehended.  Soil maps are a prime requisite for many users who need site information to make informed decisions on many aspects of use and management.  Comparison of soil resources and their respective suitabilities and/or limitations can also be used to evaluate alternate sites for intended uses.

In the United States the Cooperative Soil Survey has more than a hundred year history.  The various surveys were published with text and maps as soft covered books.  Now they are published through the internet Web Soil Survey at:  http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/

==Soil Equations==

The Bulk Density of  a soil is its dry mass divided by the total original volume of the soil.
The porosity of a soil is the volume of its pores divided by the total volume of the soil.
The particle density of a soil is the mass of its solids divided by the volume of its solids.

==Soil Water==

Field Capacity
When a soil has drained freely for several days after rain or 
irrigation, the water content is the field capacity of the soil.

The field capacity is a measure of the soils ability to store water. A sandy 
soil freely drains and the field capacity is low. A clayey soil holds water and 
has a high field capacity. A clayey soil can store more water than a sandy soil.

Soil structure effects the field capacity. A structureless clay with no large 
pores has a very high field capacity. A well structured clay with large pores 
will drain freely and has a lower field capacity.

Organic matter can absorb water and increases field capacity.

The field capacity of a soil is mainly determined by the pore size distribution. 
Small pores hold water by capillary forces. Large pores freely drain and do not 
hold water at field capacity.

Wilting Point 
When a soil is dry and plants suffer from permanent wilting 
because they are unable to absorb water, the moisture content is the wilting 
point of the soil.

When the moisture content is above the wilting point, plants can absorb water 
from the soil. Below the wilting point, water is tightly adsorbed to clay 
particles and is unavailable to plants.

Sandy soils have very low wilting points while clays have high wilting points. A 
clay contains a significant amount of water unavailable to plants.

Available Water 
The amount of water stored by a soil that can be absorbed by a 
plant is the available water and is equal to the water held at the field 
capacity minus the wilting point.

The available water is the water stored by a soil and is useful to plants. 
Texture, structure and organic matter have an effect on the available water. 
Clayey soils generally have a higher available water than sandy soils. A well 
developed structure can increase the available water. Organic matter absorbs 
water and increases the available water.

The available water stored in a soil is often measured as mm of water. Farmers 
prefer to sow a crop when there is sufficient water stored in the soil to ensure 
good plant growth. If the amount of stored water is low, the farmer needs to 
pray for rain. The amount of water available to plants also depends on the depth 
of the plant roots.

Soluble salts in soils reduces the availability of water to plants. Salt 
increases the osmotic pressure of water. High salt content in soils will kill 
plants. [http://www.ramin.com.au/creekcare]

=== Soil Water Infiltration ===
It is well known that urban development increases flooding. In urban areas the coefficient of runoff increases, and the time of concentration decreases. The coefficient of runoff in undisturbed areas can be as low as 0.1, while in inner city suburbs, coefficient of runoff can be as high as 0.9.

During rainfall a high value of coefficient of runoff occurs when most rainfall flows over the land and little water is absorbed by soils. When all the rain flows over the surface and no rain infiltrates into the soil the coefficient of runoff equals 1. If a high volume of water enters the soil the coefficient of runoff is small and approaches 0.

The main source of fresh water is rainfall runoff, which is widely used to meet human needs. Runoff is a vital part of long term water supply and renews water resources be they rivers, lakes or reservoirs. Plants need water to grow and evapotranspiration by plants returns water from the soil into the atmosphere.

Rate of water infiltration The rate at which water enters the soil during rain or irrigation is the infiltration rate.

When rain first enters a dry soil, infiltration is rapid, then decreases as it continues to rain. During the early stages of rainfall, water fills up the dry pores. When the pores are filled with water and the soil is saturated, infiltration slows down until it reaches a constant value.

When it has stopped raining, the surface soil will be saturated with water. Free water in a saturated soil will drain under gravity. After about 2 3 days, free water will have percolated downwards and the soil moisture will reach an equilibrium. When the free water has drained downwards, the moisture is at 'field capacity'.

At field capacity, soil water is held in the soil by several forces. The major part of the water is held by capillary forces. Some water is adsorbed onto the surfaces of soil particles, especially clay particles and organic matter.

Capillary water is the main supply of water to plants. Capillary water may be removed by transpiration by plants and evaporation. If the top soil is dry and the underlying soil is wet, water can move upwards by capillary action.

Above the water table there is a capillary fringe. Water moves upwards from the water table by Capillary forces. In some. soils, especially clays which contain many fine pores, the capillary fringe can be up to one metre above the water table.

During rain the infiltration rate slows down as the soil becomes wet.

Infiltration rates vary greatly between different soils, and typical values are, 100mm/hour during the first hour of rain, decreasing to 10mm/hr after six hours of rain. 

Peds are small aggregates (1 2mrn ) found in many soils. Pedal soils have a good structure and water flows easily through these soils. Apedal soils have a poor structure and apedal clayey soils have poor water infiltration. Sandy soils generally have high water infiltration and clayey soils have low infiltration rates.

If the intensity of rainfall is constant, and infiltration decreases at a typical rate, there is no runoff during the early stages of the rain event. When the infiltration rate is slower than the rainfall intensity, runoff is expected to occur.

Infiltration rate is controlled by the soil layer which has the lowest hydraulic conductivity. Often the top soil is a loam and has a high hydraulic conductivity. A clayey subsoil with a low hydraulic conductivity will act as a throttle, slowing down the final infiltration rate.

In the field, infiltration can be directly measured using a ring infiltrometer. A circular tube is forced into the soil, which is ponded with water. At specific time intervals, rate of water flow into the soil is recorded. To reduce variability, the rings need to be fairly large, generally rings should be bigger than 112 meter in diameter. Often a double ring infiltrometer is used to reduce errors from lateral water movement. Variability in these experiments is often high, so it is advisable to carry out a number of replicates.

It is common in many soils for the infiltration rate to decrease by a factor of ten, after six hours of rain. A steady state equilibrium is usually reached before six hours. Infiltration rates vary greatly between different soils, and typical values are, 10Omm/hour during the first hour of rain, decreasing to 1 mm/hr after six hours of rain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About Cantennas==
A '''cantenna''' is a directional [[wikipedia:waveguide|waveguide]] [[wikipedia:antenna (electronics)|antenna]] for long-range [[wikipedia:WiFi|WiFi]] (cf. [[wikipedia:Hi-fi|Hi-fi]]) which can be used to increase the range (or snoop) on a wireless network. Originally employing a Pringle's® Potato Chip can, a cantenna can be constructed quickly, easily, and inexpensively out of readily obtained materials. It requires four nuts, a short length of medium gauge wire, a tin can roughly 9 cm (3.66 inches) in diameter, the longer the better, and an N-Female chassis mount collector, which can be purchased at any electronic supply store. The original design employed a Pringle's can, but an optimal design will use a longer tin can. Instructions for constructing and connecting a cantenna can be found at [http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html Turnpoint.net.]

While cantennas are useful for extending a local-area network ([[wikipedia:LAN|LAN]]), the tiny design makes them ideal for mobile applications, such as [[wikipedia:wardriving|wardriving]].  Its design is so simple and ubiquitous that it is often the first antenna that [[wikipedia:WiFi|WiFi]] experimenters learn to build.  Even the [http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4181308.htm Secret Service] has taken an interest in the can antenna.

==How to make a Cantenna==

You'll need
*An N-male chassis mount connector
::One side is N-female for connecting the cable from your wireless equipment, and the other side has a small brass stub for soldering on wire. These can be found at electronics stores internet suppliers (see the list below under &quot;Connect your antenna...&quot; If you shop around, you should be able to find these for $3-$5.
*Four small nuts and bolts

*A bit of thick wire 
*A can 
::The diameter of the can should be around 8.3 cm. The cappuccino cans available at [[w:Lidl|Lidl]] supermarkets are very close to the ideal diameter..
::Reading this [http://web.archive.org/web/20070720222923/http://www.concentrate.com.au/misc/circular_waveguide_optimise.xls guide] the better size of the can it's about 92,796mm

Here's a list of some nations and regions, with their names in Chinese. Note that the country's name can also be used as an adjective. For example, 日本货 (rìběn huò) means &quot;Japanese goods,&quot; and is derived from 日本 (rìběn; Japan) and 货 (huò; goods). As an aside, China imports a good number of products from Japan. Between 2001 and 2007, it was the greatest exporter to China, beating the European Union, South Korea, and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; You could also say 日本椅子 (rìběn yǐzi; Japanese chair), 日本食品 (rìběn shípǐn; Japanese food products), and 日本动画片 (rìběn dònghuà piàn; Japanese cartoons). Terms like these can be shortened, for example, 日货 means the same thing. You can see 日 is an adjective which means &quot;pertaining to Japan,&quot; i.e., &quot;Japanese.&quot; Another way to describe its function is that it acts like a &quot;root,&quot; much like in English. Headlines are often abbreviated this way. For example, 中俄合作 (zhōng é hézuò) can mean &quot;China and Russia cooperate&quot; or &quot;Sino-Russian cooperation.&quot; In common conversation, however, excessive abbreviation is undesirable, because it often leads to ambiguity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, everyone!
Just a clear-up here.
No, I'm not Polish, as you might see from my history page.
This below is an answer to a query I had about Polish food and cuisine in celebrations last year (2004) as you will see.


1. Boże Narodzenie (God's Birth)
2. On Xmas Eve , we don't eat any meat, so traditional dishes might be:fish soup, beetroot soup with ravioli (pierogi)
         fried fish, fish (carp in jelly)
sourkraut with mashrooms (served hot)
herrings in sour cream
later cakes, like ginger cakes, cheese cakes, poppyseed cake
But each region in Poland has different dihes
3.On other holidays no special dishes are served</text>

==Purpose of Statistical test==

In general, the purpose of statistical tests is to determine whether
some hypothesis is extremely unlikely given observed data.

There are two common philosophical approaches to such tests,
''significance testing'' (due to Fisher) and ''hypothesis testing'' (due to Neyman and Pearson).

'''Significance testing''' aims to quantify evidence against a particular hypothesis 
being true. We can think of it as testing to guide research. We believe a certain statement may be true and want to work out whether it is worth investing time investigating it. Therefore, we look at the opposite of this statement. If it is quite likely then further study would seem to not make sense. However if it is extremely unlikely then further study would make sense.

A concrete example of this might be in drugs testing. We have a number of drugs that we want to test and only limited time, so we look at the hypothesis that
an individual drug has no positive effect whatsoever, and only look further if this is unlikley.

'''Hypothesis testing''' rather looks at evidence for a particular hypothesis being true. We can think of this as a guide to making a decision. We need to make
a decision soon, and suspect that a given statement is true. Thus we see how unlikely we are to be wrong, and if we are sufficiently unlikely to be wrong we can assume that this statement is true. Often this decision is final and cannot be changed.

Statisticians often overlook these differences and incorrectly treat the terms &quot;significance test&quot; and &quot;hypothesis test&quot; as though they
are interchangeable. 

A data analyst frequently wants to know whether there is a difference
between two sets of data, and whether that difference is likely to
occur due to random fluctuations, or is instead unusual enough that
random fluctuations rarely cause such differences.

In particular, frequently we wish to know something about the average
(or mean), or about the variability (as measured by variance or
standard deviation).

Statistical tests are carried out by first making some assumption,
called the Null Hypothesis, and then determining whether the data
observed is unlikely to occur given that assumption. If the
probability of seeing the observed data is small enough under the
assumed Null Hypothesis, then the Null Hypothesis is rejected.

A simple example might help. We wish to determine if men and women are
the same height on average. We select and measure 20 women and 20
men. We assume the Null Hypothesis that there is no difference between
the average value of heights for men vs. women. We can then test using
the [[Statistics/Testing_Data/t-tests2|t-test]] to determine whether our sample of 40 heights would be
unlikely to occur given this assumption. The basic idea is to assume
heights are normally distributed, and to assume that the means and
standard deviations are the same for women and for men. Then we
calculate the average of our 20 men, and of our 20 women, we also
calculate the sample standard deviation for each. Then using the
t-test of two means with 40-2 = 38
degrees of freedom we can determine whether the difference in heights
between the sample of men and the sample of women is sufficiently
large to make it unlikely that they both came from the same normal
population.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose of this [[Help:FAQ/Overview|Wikibook]]==
Every year, a group of instructors gathers to incorporate errata, changes, and revisions to each and every Flight Training Instruction (FTI).  This process typically involves many hours of painful meetings where every change&amp;mdash;from major procedural modification to typographical correction&amp;mdash;undergoes intense scrutiny.  Without fail, as soon as the updated version arrives from the printer, people begin to notice mistakes.

Why does this occur?  Despite the best intentions and vast collective experience of those charged with revising the FTI, they are but a small subset of its users, and can't possibly keep track of and correct every error to everyone's satisfaction.  Even if every instructor or student who thought of a correction or suggestion while reading the FTI sent that input in to the committee, there would still be items overlooked or, at the very best, phrased ineffectually.

By locating this document in a venue where ''anyone'' has the power to edit, revise, clarify, and make corrections to it, we hope to capitalize on the collective knowledge and intelligence not only of every ''instructor'' involved in the program, but also that of the ''students'', as well as ''military aviators serving in other training and operational commands'', and even ''civilians'' who may bring fresh insight to what has been, until now, a largely closed instructional guide.

==What this document is not==
First and foremost, it should be emphasized that this version of the ''Flight Planning FTI'' is '''not the official source for ''anything!'''''  Since it may be modified, in any way, by any person, and at any time, it should always be regarded as ''gouge''.  It is, of course, the goal of this project to facilitate a continuously evolving improvement to every printed version, and in that sense, it should usually be a ''better'' reference.  However, in any conflict between this Wikibook and the printed verson, the ''published'' FTI and its offical errata shall be considered authoritative.

In addition, it's important for those not directly associated with this training curriculum to remember that this document is not necessarily, nor is it intended to be, applicable to flight operations in general.  In particular, although military aviation is subject to many of the same regulations as civil aviation, there are also many instances where service or local directives take precedence and may diverge from FAR Part 91.

Similarly, while we also train U.S. Air Force Student Navigators, as well as officers from several allied nations, ''all'' of the flight operations conducted in this program fall under U.S. Navy flight regulations.  Please try to remember that the ultimate audience of this text is Primary Student NFOs/Navigators, and avoid cluttering it with material that, although it may apply to certain subsets of them in the future, is not applicable to the environment at hand.  When in doubt, check to make sure any additional material directly supports the terminal and enabling objectives of the course.

Finally, there may be instances when this publication is more restrictive than any governing regulation.  Again, because we instruct students in a relatively early stage of flight training, it is often necessary to provide more direction than is actually required by the rules under which Fleet aviators operate.  Changes modifying these procedures on the grounds that they are not specified by governing directives should be made cautiously.

==How to contribute==
''Everyone'' who reads these pages is now part of the group of people described above, charged with making corrections and improvements to this FTI.  The difference is, you don't have to sit through hours of painful meetings or have a grand plan for overhauling the course.  That's the advantage of the [[Wikipedia:Wiki|Wiki]] philosophy.  It doesn't matter if you're a student in the Flight Planning class right now&amp;mdash;you can still provide valuable input.  We're eager to have your assistance, but before you get started, please browse through the [[Help:Contents|help pages]] to get a feel for what a Wikibook is all about and how to contribute.

There are several ways in which you can help make this coursebook better:
* '''Fixing typos or inconsistent formatting''' &amp;ndash; even without any particular knowledge of the subject matter, just about everyone is capable of identifying and addressing this
* '''Copyediting for clarity''' &amp;ndash; this can range from rephrasing paragraphs for grammar to rewriting entire sections in order to explain topics more effectively (often, ''students'' are the best source for this, as more seasoned aviators may take certain things for granted that really do warrant a more thorough explanation)
* '''Making modifications to content''' &amp;ndash; more rarely, you may find that changes to governing instructions have rendered material factually inaccurate or you might have suggestions for substantively changing what we teach

When editing, don't be shy&amp;mdash;be bold instead.  If you're pretty certain that something needs to be changed, it probably does.  Don't worry too much about making a mistake.  Every version of each topic is retained in that page's '''[[WB:PH|History]]''', and it's simple to revert back to a previous version if something is changed in error.  That having been said, if you're at all unsure, '''do your research'''.  Talk to your peers, call the [[../Instructors|course manager]], or, better yet, try to verify your changes using official sources.  (The [[../References/]] page is a good place to begin looking.)  This will help make sure that your edits benefit the project instead of leading others astray, and it will also have the added advantage of increasing your professional knowledge.

If you think that something needs to be modified but you don't know how to phrase it, can't figure out if it's factually accurate, or if your change is potentially controversial, consider beginning a discourse on that module's '''Discussion''' page instead.  Others will chime in to help come to a consensus, at which point you, or someone else, can modify the module accordingly.

==Other concerns==
At this point, I'm sure you can readily see the advantages provided by, and incredible potential of, collaborating as a group on this project.  However, you may also be asking yourself a few nervous questions:
* ''What keeps someone from editing an article and accidentally including incorrect information?''
* ''What keeps someone from editing an article and ''intentionally'' including incorrect information?''
* ''What stops someone with malicious intent from vandalizing the entire work?''
* ''Who's in control of this whole Wikibook thing?''

The answer to all four questions, of course, is '''you'''!  An active community of benevolent readers and contributors is much more powerful than a single bad apple.  Any errors that are introduced&amp;mdash;accidentally or intentionally&amp;mdash;can be easily reverted with a couple of clicks from a page's '''History'''.  For an incredible example of how the Wiki concept can succeed in creating an accurate reference while remaining completely open and free, take a look at ''[[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]''.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cjrs 79. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cjrs 79~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

{{displaytitle|title=Early Hominid Fossils: Review of Evidence}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Overview of Human Evolutionary Origin==

The fossil record provides little information about the evolution of the human lineage during the Late Miocene, from 10 million to 5 million years ago. Around 10 million years ago, several species of large-bodied hominids that bore some resemblance to modern orangutans lived in Africa and Asia. About this time, the world began to cool; grassland and savanna habitats spread; and forests began to shrink in much of the tropics.

The creatures that occupied tropical forests declined in variety and abundance, while those that lived in the open grasslands thrived. We know that at least one ape species survived the environmental changes that occurred during the Late Miocene, because molecular genetics tells us that humans, gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees are all descended from a common ancestor that lived sometime between 7 million and 5 million years ago. Unfortunately, the fossil record for the Late Miocene tells us little about the creature that linked the forest apes to modern hominids.

Beginning about 5 million years ago, hominids begin to appear in the fossil record. These early hominids were different from any of the Miocene apes in one important way: they walked upright (as we do). Otherwise, the earliest hominids were probably not much different from modern apes in their behavior or appearance.

Between 4 million and 2 million years ago, the hominid lineage diversified, creating a community of several hominid species that ranged through eastern and southern Africa. Among the members of this community, two distinct patterns of adaptation emerged:
* One group of creatures (Australopithecus, Ardipithecus, Paranthropus) evolved large molars that enhanced their ability to process coarse plant foods;
* The second group, constituted of members of our own genus Homo (as well as Australopithecus garhi) evolved larger brains, manufactured and used stone tools, and relied more on meat than the Australopithecines did.

===''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' (&quot;Toumai&quot;)===
[[File:Sahelanthropus tchadensis - TM 266-01-060-1.jpg|thumb|right|Sahelanthropus tchadensis - commonly called &quot;Toumai&quot;. A hominid skulll from 6-7 million years ago]]
*Named in July 2002 from fossils discovered in Chad.
* Oldest known hominid or near-hominid species (6-7 million years ago).
* Discovery of nearly complete cranium and number of fragmentary lower jaws and teeth:
** Skull has very small brain size (ca. 350 cc), considered as primitive apelike feature;
** Yet, other features are characteristic of later hominids: short and relatively flat face; canines are smaller and shorter; tooth enamel is slightly thicker (suggesting a diet with less fruit).
* This mixture of features, along with fact that it comes from around the time when hominids are thought to have diverged from chimpanzees, suggests it is close to the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.
* Foramen magnum is oval (not rounded as in chimps) suggesting upright walking position.

===''Orrorin tugenensis''===

* Named in July 2001; fossils discovered in western Kenya.
* Deposits dated to about 6 million years ago.
* Fossils include fragmentary arm and thigh bones, lower jaws, and teeth:
** Limb bones are about 1.5 times larger than those of Lucy, and suggest that it was about the size of a female chimpanzee.
* Its finders claimed that Orrorin was a human ancestor adapted to both bipedality and tree climbing, and that the australopithecines are an extinct offshoot.

===''Ardipithecus ramidus''===
[[File:Ardipithecus Gesamt.jpg|thumb|right|Skeleton of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'']]
*Recent discovery announced in Sept. 1994.
*Dated  4.4 million years ago.
*Most remains are skull fragments.
** Indirect evidence suggests that it was possibly bipedal, and that some individuals were about 122 cm (4'0&quot;) tall;
** Teeth are intermediate between those of earlier apes and Austalopithecus afarensis.

===''Australopithecus anamensis''===

*Named in August 1995 from fossils from Kanapoi and Allia Bay in Kenya.
*Dated between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago.
*Fossils show mixture of primitive features in the skull, and advanced features in the body:
**Teeth and jaws are very similar to those of older fossil apes;
**Partial tibia is strong evidence of bipedality, and lower humerus (the upper arm bone) is extremely humanlike.

===''Australopithecus afarensis''===
[[File:Lucy_Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Lucy&quot;, an ''Australopithecus afarensis'' skeleton]]
*Existed between 3.9 and 3.0 million years ago.
*''A. afarensis'' had an apelike face with a low forehead, a bony ridge over the eyes, a flat nose, and no chin. They had protruding jaws with large back teeth.
*Cranial capacity: 375 to 550 cc. Skull is similar to chimpanzee, except for more human-like teeth. Canine teeth are much smaller than modern apes, but larger and more pointed than humans, and shape of the jaw is between rectangular shape of apes and parabolic shape of humans.
*Pelvis and leg bones far more closely resemble those of modern humans, and leave no doubt that they were bipedal.
*Bones show that they were physically very strong.
*Females were substantially smaller than males, a condition known as sexual dimorphism. Height varied between about 107 cm (3'6&quot;) and 152 cm (5'0&quot;).
*Finger and toe bones are curved and proportionally longer than in humans, but hands are similar to humans in most other details.

===''Kenyanthropus platyops'' (&quot;flat-faced man of Kenya&quot;)===
[[File:Kenyanthropus_platyops,_skull_(model).JPG|thumb|right|Skull of ''Kenyanthropus platyops'']]
*Named in 2001 from partial skull found in Kenya.
*Dated to about 3.5 million years ago.
*Fossils show unusual mixture of features: size of skull is similar to ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. africanus'', and has a large, flat face and small teeth.

===''Australopithecus garhi''===

* ''A. garhi'' existed around 2.5 Myrs.
* It has an apelike face in the lower part, with a protruding jaw resembling that of ''A. afarensis''. The large size of the palate and teeth suggests that it is a male, with a small braincase of about 450 cc.
* It is like no other hominid species and is clearly not a robust form. In a few dental traits, such as the shape of the premolar and the size ratio of the canine teeth to the molars, ''A. garhi'' resembles specimens of early Homo. But its molars are huge, even larger than the ''A. robustus'' average.
* Among skeletal finds recovered, femur is relatively long, like that of modern humans. But forearm is long too, a condition found in apes and other australopithecines but not in humans.

===''Australopithecus africanus''===

* First identified in 1924 by Raymond Dart, an Australian anatomist living in South Africa.
* ''A. africanus'' existed between 3 and 2 million years ago.
* Similar to ''A. afarensis'', and was also bipedal, but body size was slightly greater.
* Brain size may also have been slightly larger, ranging between 420 and 500 cc. This is a little larger than chimp brains (despite a similar body size).
* Back teeth were a little bigger than in ''A. afarensis''. Although the teeth and jaws of ''A. africanus'' are much larger than those of humans, they are far more similar to human teeth than to those of apes. The shape of the jaw is now fully parabolic, like that of humans, and the size of the canine teeth is further reduced compared to ''A. afarensis''.

NOTE: ''Australopithecus afarensis'' and ''A. africanus'' are known as gracile australopithecines, because of their relatively lighter build, especially in the skull and teeth. (Gracile means &quot;slender&quot;, and in paleoanthropology is used as an antonym to &quot;robust&quot;). Despite the use of the word &quot;gracile&quot;, these creatures were still more far more robust than modern humans.

===''Australopithecus aethiopicus''===

*''A. aethiopicus'' existed between 2.6 and 2.3 million years ago.
*Species known mainly from one major specimen: the Black Skull (KNM-WT 17000) discovered at Lake Turkana.
*It may be ancestor of ''P. robustus'' and ''P. boisei'', but it has a baffling mixture of primitive and advanced traits:
** Brain size is very small (410 cc) and parts of the skull (particularly the hind portions) are very primitive, most resembling ''A. afarensis'';
** Other characteristics, like massiveness of face, jaws and largest sagittal crest in any known hominid, are more reminiscent of ''P. boisei''.

===''Paranthropus boisei''===
[[File:Paranthropus-boisei-Nairobi.JPG|thumb|right|Skull of ''Paranthropus boisei'']]
* ''P. boisei'' existed between 2.2 and 1.3 million years ago.
* Similar to ''P. robustus'', but face and cheek teeth were even more massive, some molars being up to 2 cm across. Brain size is very similar to P. robustus, about 530 cc.
* A few experts consider ''P. boisei'' and ''P. robustus'' to be variants of the same species.

===''Paranthropus robustus''===

* ''P. robustus'' had a body similar to that of ''A. africanus'', but a larger and more robust skull and teeth.
* It existed between 2 and 1.5 million years ago.
* The massive face is flat, with large brow ridges and no forehead. It has relatively small front teeth, but massive grinding teeth in a large lower jaw. Most specimens have sagittal crests.
* Its diet would have been mostly coarse, tough food that needed a lot of chewing.
* The average brain size is about 530 cc. Bones excavated with ''P. robustus'' skeletons indicate that they may have been used as digging tools.

''Australopithecus aethiopicus'', ''Paranthropus robustus'' and ''P. boisei'' are known as robust australopithecines, because their skulls in particular are more heavily built.

===''Homo habilis''===
[[File:Homo_habilis-KNM_ER_1813.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''Homo habilis'']]
* ''H. habilis'' (&quot;handy man&quot;) 
* ''H. habilis'' existed between 2.4 and 1.5 million years ago.
* It is very similar to australopithecines in many ways. The face is still primitive, but it projects less than in A. africanus. The back teeth are smaller, but still considerably larger than in modern humans. 
* The average brain size, at 650 cc, larger than in  australopithecines. Brain size varies between 500 and 800 cc, overlapping the australopithecines at the low end and ''H. erectus'' at the high end. The brain shape is also more humanlike.
* ''H. habilis'' is thought to have been about 127 cm (5'0&quot;) tall, and about 45 kg (100 lb) in weight, although females may have been smaller.
* Because of important morphological variation among the fossils, ''H. habilis'' has been a controversial species. Some scientists have not accepted it, believing that all ''H. habilis'' specimens should be assigned to either the australopithecines or Homo erectus. Many now believe that ''H. habilis'' combines specimens from at least two different ''Homo'' species: small-brained less-robust individuals (''H. habilis'') and large-brained, more robust ones (''H. rudolfensis''). Presently, not enough is known about these creatures to resolve this debate.

{{displaytitle|title=Early Hominids: Phylogeny and Chronology}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Phylogeny and Chronology==
===Between 8 million and 4 million years ago===

Fossils of ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' (6-7 million years) and ''Orrorin tugenensis'' (6 million years), discovered in 2001 and 2000 respectively, are still a matter of
debate.

The discoverers of ''Orrorin tugenensis'' claim the fossils represent the real ancestor of modern humans and that the other early hominids (e.g., Australopithecus and Paranthropus) are side branches. They base their claim on their assessment that this hominid was bipedal (2 million years earlier than previously thought) and exhibited expressions of certain traits that were more modern than those of other early hominids. Other authorities disagree with this analysis and some question whether this form is even a hominid. At this point, there is too little information to do more than mention these two new finds of hominids. As new data come in, however, a major part of our story could change.

Fossils of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' (4.4 million years ago) were different enough from any found previously to warrant creating a new hominid genus. Although the evidence from the foramen magnum indicates that they were bipedal, conclusive evidence from legs, pelvis and feet remain somewhat enigmatic. There might be some consensus that ''A. ramidus'' represent a side branch of the hominid family.

===Between 4 million and 2 million years ago===

''Australopithecus anamensis'' (4.2-3.8 million years ago) exhibit mixture of primitive (large canine teeth, parallel tooth rows) and derived (vertical root of canine, thicker tooth enamel) features, with evidence of bipedalism. There appears to be some consensus that this may represent the ancestor of all later hominids.

The next species is well established and its nature is generally agreed upon: ''Australopithecus afarensis'' (4-3 million years ago). There is no doubt that ''A. afarensis'' were bipeds. This form seems to still remain our best candidate for the species that gave rise to subsequent hominids.

At the same time lived a second species of hominid in Chad: ''Australopithecus bahrelghazali'' (3.5-3 million years ago). It suggests that early hominids were more widely spread on the African continent than previously thought. Yet full acceptance of this classification and the implications of the fossil await further study.

Another fossil species contemporaneous with A. afarensis existed in East Africa: ''Kenyanthropus platyops'' (3.5 million years ago). The fossils show a combination of features unlike that of any other forms: brain size, dentition, details of nasal region resemble genus Australopithecus; flat face, cheek area, brow ridges resemble later hominids. This set of traits led its discoverers to give it not only a new species name but a new genus name as well. Some authorities have suggested that this new form may be a better common ancestor for Homo than ''A. afarensis''. More evidence and more examples with the same set of features, however, are needed to even establish that these fossils do represent a whole new taxonomy.

Little changed from A. afarensis to the next species: ''A. africanus'': same body size and shape, and same brain size. There are a few differences, however: canine teeth are smaller, no gap in tooth row, tooth row more rounded (more human-like).

We may consider A. africanus as a continuation of ''A. afarensis'', more widely distributed in southern and possibly eastern Africa and showing some evolutionary changes. It should be noted that this interpretation is not agreed upon by all investigators and remains hypothetical.

Fossils found at Bouri in Ethiopia led investigators to designate a new species: ''A. garhi'' (2.5 million years ago). Intriguing mixture of features: several features of teeth resemble early ''Homo''; whereas molars are unusually larger, even larger than the southern African robust australopithecines.

The evolutionary relationship of A. garhi to other hominids is still a matter of debate. Its discoverers feel it is descended from A. afarensis and is a direct ancestor to Homo. Other disagree. Clearly, more evidence is needed to interpret these specimens more precisely, but they do show the extent of variation among hominids during this period.

Two distinctly different types of hominid appear between 2 and 3 million years ago:
robust australopithecines (''Paranthropus'') and early ''Homo'' (''Homo habilis''). 

The first type retains the chimpanzee-sized brains and small bodies of Australopithecus, but has evolved a notable robusticity in the areas of the skull involved with chewing: this is the group of robust australopithecines (''A. boisei'', ''A. robustus'', ''A. aethiopicus'').
* The Australopithecines diet seems to have consisted for the most part of plant foods, although ''A. afarensis'', ''A. africanus'' and ''A. garhi'' may have consumed limited amounts of animal protein as well;
* Later Australopithecines (''A. boisei'' and robustus) evolved into more specialized &quot;grinding machines&quot; as their jaws became markedly larger, while their brain size did not.

The second new hominid genus that appeared about 2.5 million years ago is the one to which modern humans belong, ''Homo''.
* A Consideration of brain size relative to body size clearly indicates that Homo habilis had undergone enlargement of the brain far in excess of values predicted on the basis of body size alone. This means that there was a marked advance in information-processing capacity over that of Australopithecines;
* Although ''H. habilis'' had teeth that are large by modern standard, they are smaller in relation to the size of the skull than those of Australopithecines. Major brain-size increase and tooth-size reduction are important trends in the evolution of the genus Homo, but not of Australopithecines;
* From the standpoint of anatomy alone, it has long been recognized that either A. afarensis or ''A. africanus'' constitute a good ancestor for the genus Homo, and it now seems clear that the body of ''Homo habilis'' had changed little from that of either species. Precisely which of the two species gave rise to ''H. habilis'' is vigorously debated. Whether ''H. habilis'' is descended from ''A. afarensis'',  ''A. africanus'', both of them, or neither of them, is still a matter of debate. It is also possible that none of the known australopithecines is our ancestor. The discoveries of ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'', ''Orrorin tugenensis'', and ''A. anamensis'' are so recent that it is hard to say what effect they will have on current theories.

What might have caused the branching that founded the new forms of robust australopithecines (Paranthropus) and Homo? What caused the extinction, around the same time (between 2-3 million years ago) of genus Australopithecus? Finally, what might have caused the extinction of Paranthropus about 1 million years ago?

No certainty in answering these questions. But the environmental conditions at the time might hold some clues. Increased environmental variability, starting about 6 million years ago and continuing through time and resulting in a series of newly emerging and diverse habitats, may have initially promoted different adaptations among hominid populations, as seen in the branching that gave rise to the robust hominids and to Homo.

And if the degree of the environmental fluctuations continued to increase, this may have put such pressure on the hominid adaptive responses that those groups less able to cope eventually became extinct. Unable to survive well enough to perpetuate themselves in the face of decreasing resources (e.g., Paranthropus, who were specialized vegetarians) these now-extinct hominids were possibly out-competed for space and resources by the better adapted hominids, a phenomenon known as competitive exclusion.

In this case, only the adaptive response that included an increase in brain size, with its concomitant increase in ability to understand and manipulate the environment, proved successful in the long run.

==Hominoid, Hominid, Human==

The traditional view has been to recognize three families of hominoid: the ''Hylobatidae'' (Asian lesser apes: gibbons and siamangs), the ''Pongidae'', and the ''Hominidae''.
* The Pongidae include the African great apes, including gorillas, chimpanzees, and the Asian orangutan;
* The Hominidae include living humans and typically fossil apes that possess a suite of characteristics such as bipedalism, reduced canine size, and increasing brain size (e.g., australopithecines).

===The emergence of hominoids===

Hominoids are Late Miocene (15-5 million years ago) primates that share a small number of postcranial features with living apes and humans:
* no tail;
* pelvis lacks bony expansion;
* elbow similar to that of modern apes;
*somewhat larger brains in relationship to body size than similarly sized monkeys.

===When is a hominoid also a hominid?===

When we say that ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' is the earliest hominid, we mean that it is the oldest fossil that is classified with humans in the family ''Hominidae''. The rationale for including ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' in the ''Hominidae'' is based on similarities in shared derived characters that distinguish humans from other living primates.

There are three categories of traits that separate hominids from contemporary apes:
* bipedalism;
* much larger brain in relation to body size;
* dentition and musculature.

To be classified as a hominid, a Late Miocene primate (hominoid) must display at least some of these characteristics. ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' is bipedal, and shares many dental features with modern humans. However, the brain of ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' was no bigger than that of contemporary chimpanzees. As a consequence, this fossil is included in the same family (Hominidae) as modern humans, but not in the same genus.

===Traits defining early ''Homo''===

Early Homo (e.g., ''Homo habilis'') is distinctly different from any of the earliest hominids, including the australopithecines, and similar to us in the following ways:
* brain size is substantially bigger than that of any of the earliest hominids, including the australopithecines;
* teeth are smaller, enamel thinner, and the dental arcade is more parabolic than is found in the earliest hominids, including the australopithecines;
* skulls are more rounded; the face is smaller and protrudes less, and the jaw muscles are reduced compared with earliest hominids, including the australopithecines.

{{displaytitle|title=Behaviorial Patterns of the Earliest Hominids}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
One of the most important and intriguing questions in human evolution is
about the diet of our earliest ancestors. The presence of primitive stone tools in the fossil record tells us that
2.5 million years ago, early hominids (''A. garhi'') were using stone implements to cut
the flesh off the bones of large animals that they had either hunted or
whose carcasses they had scavenged.

Earlier than 2.5 million years ago, however, we know very little about the foods
that the early hominids ate, and the role that meat played in their diet. 
This is due to lack of direct evidence. Nevertheless, paleoanthropologists and archaeologists have tried to
answer these questions indirectly using a number of techniques.
* Primatology (studies on chimpanzee behavior)
* Anatomical Features (tooth morphology and wear-patterns)
* Isotopic Studies

==What does chimpanzee food-consuming behavior suggest about early hominid behavior?==

===Meat consuming strategy===
Earliest ancestors and chimpanzees share a common ancestor (around 5-7
million years ago). Therefore, understanding chimpanzee hunting behavior and ecology
may tell us a great deal about the behavior and ecology of those earliest
hominids.

In the early 1960s, when Jane Goodall began her research on chimpanzees
in Gombe National Park (Tanzania), it was thought that chimpanzees were herbivores.
In fact, when Goodall first reported meat hunting by
chimpanzees, many people were extremely sceptical.

Today, hunting by chimpanzees at Gombe and other locations in Africa has
been well documented.

We now know that each year chimpanzees may kill and eat more than 150 small
and medium-sized animals, such as monkeys (red colobus monkey, their
favorite prey), but also wild pigs and small antelopes.

Did early hominids hunt and eat small and medium-sized animals? It is
quite possible that they did. We know that colobus-like monkeys inhabited
the woodlands and riverside gallery forest in which early hominids lived
3-5 Myrs ago. There were also small animals and the young of larger animals
to catch opportunistically on the ground.

Many researchers now believe that the carcasses of dead animals were an
important source of meat for early hominids once they had stone tools to
use (after 2.5 million years ago) for removing the flesh from the carcass.
Wild chimpanzees show little interest in dead animals as a food source, so
scavenging may have evolved as an important mode of getting food when
hominids began to make and use tools for getting at meat.

Before this time, it seems likely that earlier hominids were hunting small
mammals as chimpanzees do today and that the role that hunting played in
the early hominids' social lives was probably as complex and political as
it is in the social lives of chimpanzees.

When we ask when meat became an important part of the human diet, we
therefore must look well before the evolutionary split between apes and
humans in our own family tree.

=== Nut cracking===
Nut cracking behavior is another chimpanzee activity that can partially reflect early hominin behavior. From Jan. 2006 to May 2006, Susana Carvalho and her colleagues conducted a series of observation on several chimpanzee groups in Bossou and Diecké in Guinea, western Africa. Both direct and indirect observation approach was applied to outdoor laboratory and wild environment scenarios. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Carvalho et al|year=2008|title=Chaînes opératoire and resource-exploitation strategies in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) nut cracking|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=55|pages=148–163|doi=0.1016/j.jhevol.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  results of this research show three resource-exploitation strategies that chimpanzees apply to utilize lithic material as hammers and anvils to crack nut:
1) Maximum optimization of time and energy (choose the closest spot to process nut).
2) Transport of nuts to a different site or transport of the raw materials for tools to the food.
3) Social strategy such as the behavior of transport of tools and food to a more distant spot. This behavior might relate to sharing of space and resources when various individuals occupy the same area. 

The results demonstrate that chimpanzees have similar food exploitation strategies with early hominins which indicate the potential application of primate archaeology to the understanding of early hominin behavior.

==What do tooth wear patterns suggest about early hominid behavior?==

Bones and teeth in the living person are very plastic and respond to
mechanical stimuli over the course of an individual's lifetime. We know,
for example, that food consistency (hard vs. soft) has a strong impact on
the masticatory (chewing) system (muscles and teeth). Bones and teeth in
the living person are therefore tissues that are remarkably
sensitive to the environment.

As such, human remains from archaeological sites offer us a retrospective
biological picture of the past that is rarely available from other lines of
evidence.

Also, new technological advances developed in the past ten years or so now
make it possible to reconstruct and interpret in amazing detail the
physical activities and adaptations of hominids in diverse environmental
settings.

Some types of foods are more difficult to process than others, and
primates tend to specialize in different kinds of diets. Most living
primates show three basic dietary adaptations:
* insectivores (insect eaters);
* frugivores (fruit eaters);
* folivores (leaf eaters).
Many primates, such as humans, show a combination of these patterns and are
called omnivores, which in a few primates includes eating meat.

The ingestion both of leaves and of insects requires that the leaves and
the insect skeletons be broken up and chopped into small pieces. The molars
of folivores and insectivores are characterized by the development of
shearing crests on the molars that function to cut food into small pieces.
Insectivores' molars are further characterized by high, pointed cusps that
are capable of puncturing the outside skeleton of insects.
Frugivores, on the other hand, have molar teeth with low, rounded cusps;
their molars have few crests and are characterized by broad, flat basins
for crushing the food.

In the 1950s, John Robinson developed what came to be known as the
dietary hypothesis. According to this theory there were fundamentally two
kinds of hominids in the Plio-Pleistocene. One was the &quot;robust&quot;
australopithecine (called Paranthropus) that was specialized for herbivory,
and the other was the &quot;gracile&quot; australopithecine that was an
omnivore/carnivore. By this theory the former became extinct while the
latter evolved into ''Homo''.

Like most generalizations about human evolution, Robinson's dietary
hypothesis was controversial, but it stood as a useful model for decades.

Detailed analyses of the tooth surface under microscope appeared to
confirm that the diet of ''A. robustus'' consisted primarily of plants,
particularly small and hard objects like seeds, nuts and tubers. The
relative sizes and shapes of the teeth of both ''A. afarensis'' and ''A. africanus'' indicated as well a mostly mixed vegetable diet of fruits and
leaves. By contrast, early ''Homo'' was more omnivorous.

But as new fossil hominid species were discovered in East Africa and new
analyses were done on the old fossils, the usefulness of the model
diminished.

For instance, there is a new understanding that the two South African
species (''A. africanus'' and ''A. robustus'') are very similar when compared to
other early hominid species. They share a suite of traits that are absent
in earlier species of Australopithecus, including expanded cheek teeth and
faces reemodeled to withstand forces generated from heavy chewing.

==What do isotopic studies suggest about early hominid behavior?==

Omnivory can be suggested by studies of the stable carbon isotopes and
strontium(Sr)-calcium(Ca) ratios in early hominid teeth and bones.

For instance, a recent study of carbon isotope (13C) in the tooth enamel
of a sample of ''A. africanus'' indicated that members of this species ate
either tropical grasses or the flesh of animals that ate tropical grasses
or both. But because the dentition analyzed by these researchers lacked the
tooth wear patterns indicative of grass-eating, the carbon may have come
from grass-eating animals. This is therefore a possible evidence that the
australopithecines either hunted small animals or scavenged the carcasses
of larger ones.

There is new evidence also that ''A. robustus'' might not be a herbivore. 
Isotopic studies reveal chemical signals associated with
animals whose diet is omnivorous and not specialized herbivory. The results
from 13C analysis indicate that ''A. robustus'' either ate grass and grass
seeds or ate animals that ate grasses. Since the Sr/Ca ratios suggest that
''A. robustus'' did not eat grasses, these data indicate that ''A. robustus'' was
at least partially carnivorous.

==Summary==

Much of the evidence for the earliest hominids (''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'', ''Orrorin tugenensis'', ''Ardipithecus ramidus'') is not yet available.

''Australopithecus anamensis'' shows the first indications of thicker molar
enamel in a hominid. This suggests that ''A. anamensis'' might have been the
first hominid to be able to effectively withstand the functional demands of
hard and perhaps abrasive objects in its diet, whether or not such items
were frequently eaten or were only an important occasional food source.

Australopithecus afarensis was similar to ''A. anamensis'' in relative tooth
sizes and probable enamel thickness, yet it did show a large increase in
mandibular robusticity. Hard and perhaps abrasive foods may have become
then even more important components of the diet of ''A. afarensis''.

''Australopithecus africanus'' shows yet another increase in postcanine tooth
size, which in itself would suggest an increase in the sizes and
abrasiveness of foods. However, its molar microwear does not show the
degree of pitting one might expect from a classic hard-object feeder. Thus,
even ''A. africanus'' has evidently not begun to specialize in hard objects,
but rather has emphasized dietary breadth (omnivore), as evidenced by
isotopic studies.

Subsequent &quot;robust&quot; australopithecines do show hard-object microwear and craniodental specializations, suggesting a substantial departude in feeding adaptive strategies early in the Pleistocene. Yet, recent chemical and anatomical studies on ''A. robustus'' suggest that this species may have consumed some animal protein.
In fact, they might have specialized on tough plant material during the dry season but had a more diverse diet during the rest of the year.

The [[w:Japanese Language Proficiency Test|Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] (JLPT) (日本語能力試験 ''nihongo n&amp;#333;ryoku shiken'') was set up in 1984 in response to the increasing demand of students of the Japanese language to certify their proficiency. There are five levels: N5 (easiest) to N1 (hardest).

=== Application ===
The JLPT tests are held twice a year.  In December all five levels can be taken but in July only the most difficult levels, levels 1 and 2, can be taken.  The test date for winter of 2010 is on 5th December and the application period is usually September-October.

If you are interested in applying for the JLPT test, see [http://momo.jpf.go.jp/jlpt/e/list_e.html] for your nearest test center. Also ask about the application period and application fee as they differ in each country.  The JLPT is offered in approximately 40 countries.

In Japan, the test is administered by the '''Japan Educational Exchanges and Services''' (JEES) (財団法人 日本国際教育支援協会 ''zaidan h&amp;#333;jin nihon kokusai ky&amp;#333;iku shien ky&amp;#333;kai''), [http://www.jees.or.jp/index.htm],  while the '''Japan Foundation''' (独立行政法人 国際交流基金 ''dokuritsu gy&amp;#333;sei h&amp;#333;jin kokusai k&amp;#333;ry&amp;#363; kikin'') administers overseas tests.

=== Criteria ===
&lt;u&gt;Important note to students wishing to study in Japanese universities:&lt;/u&gt;

The JLPT certification was a requirement for entry into Japanese universities until 2003. The '''Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students''' (EJU) replaces JLPT as the requirement for university entry in Japan. More on this will be written on a seperate page.

==Old test levels==
In 2010, the test changed from four levels to five.  Additionally, the criteria for passing the JLPT was changed, requiring a passing mark in all sections of the test, not just an overall passing mark.  Some websites have not been updated to reflect this change, but the material on them for N5, N4, and N1 can be considered fairly reliable, since those tests are much the same as before.

[[File:Position_of_Olduvai_Gorge_in_Africa_-_245-1227-1-PB-A.jpeg|thumb|right|Position of Olduvai Gorge within Africa]]
==The Olduvai Gorge==
2 million years ago, Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) was a lake. Its shores were
inhabited not only by numerous wild animals but also by groups of hominids,
including Paranthropus boisei and Homo habilis, as well as the later Homo
erectus.

The gorge, therefore, is a great source of Palaeolithic remains as well
as a key site providing evidence of human evolutionary development. This is
one of the main reasons that drew Louis and Mary Leakey back year after
year at Olduvai Gorge.

Certain details of the lives of the creatures who lived at Olduvai have
been reconstructed from the hundreds of thousands of bits of material that
they left behind: various stones and bones. No one of these things, alone,
would mean much, but when all are analyzed and fitted together, patterns
begin to emerge.

Among the finds are assemblages of stone tools dated to between 2.2 Myrs
and 620,000 years ago. These were found little disturbed from when they
were left, together with the bones of now-extinct animals that provided
food.

Mary Leakey found that there were two stoneworking traditions at Olduvai.
One, the Acheulean industry, appears first in Bed II and lasts until Bed
IV. The other, the Oldowan, is older and more primitive, and occurs
throughout Bed I, as well as at other African sites in Ethiopia, Kenya and
Tanzania.

==Subsistence patterns==
===Meat-eating===

Until about 2.5 million years ago, early hominids lived on foods that could be picked or gathered: plants, fruits, invertebrate animals such as ants and termites, and even  occasional pieces of meat (perhaps hunted in the same manner as chimpanzees do today).

After 2.5 million years ago, meat seems to become more important in early hominids' diet. Evolving hominids' new interest in meat is of major importance in paleoanthropology.

Out on the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino-acid requirements from available plant resources. Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death. The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked. In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids. All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their &quot;protein problem&quot; in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today.

[[File:OGAP’s_excavations_at_HWKEE_-_245-1229-1-PB.jpeg|thumb|right|Excavations at an Olduvai Gorge site]]
Increased meat consumption on the part of early hominids did more than merely ensure an adequate intake of essential amino acids. Animals that live on plant foods must eat large quantities of vegetation, and obtaining such foods consumes much of their time. Meat eaters, by contrast, have no need to eat so much or so often. Consequently, meat-eating hominids may have had more leisure time available to explore and manipulate their environment, and to lie around and play. Such activities probably were a stimulus to hominid brain development.

The importance of meat eating for early hominid brain development is suggested by the size of their brains:
* cranial capacity of largely plant-eating    Australopithecus ranged from 310 to 530 cc;
* cranial capacity of primitive known meat eater, Homo habilis: 580 to 752 cc;
* ''Homo erectus'' possessed a cranial capacity of 775 to 1,225 cc.

===Hunters or scavengers?===

The archaeological evidence indicates that Oldowan hominids ate meat. They processed the carcasses of large animals, and we assume that they ate the meat they cut from the bones. Meat-eating animals can acquire meat in several different ways:
* stealing kills made by other animals;
* by opportunistically exploiting the carcasses	of animals that die naturally;
* by hunting or capturing prey themselves.

There has been considerable dispute among anthropologists about how early hominids acquired meat. Some have argued that hunting, division of labor, use of home bases and food sharing emerged very early in hominid history. Others think the Oldowan hominids would have been unable to capture large mammals because they were too small and too poorly armed.

Recent zooarchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids (after 2.5 million years ago) may have acquired meat mainly by scavenging, and maybe occasionally by hunting.

If hominids obtained most of their meat from scavenging, we would expect to find cut marks mainly on bones left at kill sites by predators (lions, hyenas). If hominids obtained most of their meat from their own kills, we would expect to find cut marks mainly on large bones, like limb bones. However, at Olduvai Gorge, cut marks appear on both kinds of bones: those usually left by scavengers and those normally monopolized by hunters. The evidence from tool marks on bones indicates that humans sometimes acquired meaty bones before, and sometimes after, other predators had gnawed on them.

==Settlement patterns==

During decades of work at Olduvai Gorge, Mary and Louis Leakey and their team laid bare numerous ancient hominid sites. Sometimes the sites were simply spots where the bones of one or more hominid species were discovered. Often, however, hominid remains were found in association with concentrations of animal bones, stone tools, and debris.

At one spot, in Bed I, the bones of an elephant lay in close association with more than 200 stone tools. Apparently, the animal was butchered here; there are no indications of any other activity.

At another spot (DK-I Site), on an occupation surface 1.8 million years old, basalt stones were found grouped in small heaps forming a circle. The interior of the circle was practically empty, while numerous tools and food debris littered the ground outside, right up to the edge of the circle.

==Earliest stone industry==
===Principles===
[[File:Olduvai stone chopping tool british museum.JPG|thumb|right|Chopper from Olduvai, 1-2 Myrs old]]
Use of specially made stone tools appears to have arisen as result of need for implements to butcher and prepare meat, because hominid teeth were inadequate for the task. Transformation of lump of stone into a &quot;chopper&quot;, &quot;knife&quot; or &quot;scraper&quot; is a far cry from what a chimpanzee does when it transforms a stick into a termite probe. The stone tool is quite unlike the lump of stone. Thus, the toolmaker must have in mind an abstract idea of the tool to be made, as well as a specific set of steps that will accomplish the transformation from raw material to finished product. Furthermore, only certain kinds of stone have the flaking properties that will allow the transformation to take place, and the toolmaker must know about these.

Therefore, two main components to remember:
* Raw material properties
* Flaking properties

===Evidence===
The oldest Lower Palaeolithic tools (2.0-1.5 million years ago) found at Olduvai Gorge (''Homo habilis'') are in the Oldowan tool tradition. Nevertheless, older materials (2.6-2.5 million year ago) have recently been recorded from sites located in Ethiopia (Hadar, Omo, Gona, Bouri - ''Australopithecus garhi'') and Kenya (Lokalalei).

Because of a lack of remarkable differences in the techniques and styles of artifact manufacture for over 1 million years (2.6-1.5 million years ago), a technological stasis was suggested for the Oldowan Industry.

The makers of the earliest stone artifacts travelled some distances to acquire their raw materials, implying greater mobility, long-term planning and foresight not recognized earlier.

Oldowan stone tools consist of all-purpose generalized chopping tools and flakes. Although these artifacts are very crude, it is clear that they have been deliberately modified. The technique of manufacture used was the percussion.

The main intent of Oldowan tool makers was the production of cores and flakes with sharp-edges. These simple but effective Oldowan choppers and flakes made possible the addition of meat to the diet on a regular basis, because people could now butcher meat, skin any animal, and split bones for marrow.

Overall, the hominids responsible for making these stone tools understood the flaking properties of the raw materials available; they selected appropriate cobbles for making artifacts; and they were as competent as later hominids in their knapping abilities.

Finally, the manufacture of stone tools must have played a major role in the evolution of the human brain, first by putting a premium on manual dexterity and fine manipulation over mere power in the use of the hands. This in turn put a premium in the use of the hands.

==Early hominid behavior==

During the 1970s and 1980s many workers, including Mary Leakey and Glynn Isaac, used an analogy from modern hunter-gatherer cultures to interpret early hominid behavior of the Oldowan period (e.g., the Bed I sites at Olduvai Gorge). They concluded that many of the sites were probably camps, often called &quot;home bases&quot;, where group members gathered at the end of the day to prepare and share food, to socialize, to make tools, and to sleep.

The circular concentration of stones at the DK-I site was interpreted as the remains of a shelter or windbreak similar to those still made by some African foraging cultures. Other concentrations of bones and stones were thought to be the remains of living sites originally ringed by thorn hedges for defense against predators. Later, other humanlike elements were added to the mix, and early Homo was described as showing a sexual division of labor [females gathering plant foods and males hunting for meat] and some of the Olduvai occupation levels were interpreted as butchering sites.

Views on the lifestyle of early ''Homo'' began to change in the late 1980s, as many scholars became convinced that these hominids had been overly humanized.

Researchers began to show that early ''Homo'' shared the Olduvai sites with a variety of large carnivores, thus weakening the idea that these were the safe, social home bases originally envisioned.

Studies of bone accumulations suggested that ''H. habilis'' was mainly a scavenger and not a full-fledged hunter. The bed I sites were interpreted as no more than &quot;scavenging stations&quot; where early ''Homo'' brought portions of large animal carcasses for consumption.

Another recent suggestion is that the Olduvai Bed I sites mainly represent places where rocks were cached for the handy processing of animal foods obtained nearby. Oldowan toolmakers  brought stones from sources several kilometers away and cached them at a number of locations within the group's territory. Stone tools could have been made at the cache sites for use elsewhere, but more frequently portions of carcasses were transported to the toolmaking site for processing.

==Summary==
Current interpretations of the subsistence, settlement, and tool-use patterns of early hominids of the Oldowan period are more conservative than they have been in the past. Based upon these revised interpretations, the Oldowan toolmakers have recently been dehumanized.

Although much more advanced than advanced apes, they still were probably quite different from modern people with regard to their living arrangements, methods and sexual division of food procurement and the sharing of food.

The label human has to await the appearance of the next representative of the hominid family: ''Homo erectus''.

{{displaytitle|title=The Acheulean Period}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In 1866, German biologist Ernst Haeckel had proposed the generic name &quot;''Pithecanthropus''&quot; for a hypothetical missing link between apes and humans.

In late 19th century, Dutch anatomist Eugene Dubois was on the Indonesian island of Java, searching for human fossils.  In the fall of 1891, he encountered the now famous Trinil skull cap. The following year his crew uncovered a femur, a left thigh bone, very similar to that of modern humans. He was convinced he had discovered an erect, apelike transitional form between apes and humans. In 1894, he decided to call his fossil species ''Pithecanthropus erectus''. Dubois found no additional human fossils and he returned to the Netherlands in 1895.

Others explored the same deposits on the island of Java, but new human remains appeared only between 1931 and 1933.

Dubois's claim for a primitive human species was further reinforced by nearly simultaneous discoveries from near Beijing, China (at the site of Zhoukoudian). Between 1921 and 1937, various scholars undertook fieldwork in one collapsed cave (Locality 1) recovered many fragments of mandibles and skulls. One of them, Davidson Black, a Canadian anatomist, created a new genus and species for these fossils: ''Sinanthropus pekinensis'' (&quot;Peking Chinese man&quot;).

In 1939, after comparison of the fossils in China and Java, some scholars concluded that they were extremely similar. They even proposed that Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus were only subspecies of a single species, ''Homo erectus'', though they continued to use  the original generic names as labels.

From 1950 to 1964, various influential authorities in paleoanthropology agreed that Pithecanthropus and Sinanthropus were too similar to be placed in two different genera; and, by the late 1960s, the concept of Homo erectus was widely accepted.

To the East Asian inventory of ''H. erectus'', many authorities would add European and especially African specimens that resembled the Asian fossil forms. In 1976, a team led by Richard Leakey discovered around Lake Turkana (Kenya) an amazingly well-preserved and complete skeleton of a ''H. erectus'' boy, called the Turkana Boy (WT-15000).

In 1980s and 1990s:
* new discoveries in Asia (Longgupo, Dmanisi, etc.); in Europe (Atapuerca, Orce, Ceprano);
* precision in chronology and evolution of ''H. erectus'';
* understanding and definition of variability of this species and relationship with other contemporary species.

==Site distribution==
===Africa===

Unlike Australopithecines and even ''Homo habilis'', ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' was distributed throughout Africa:
* about 1.5 million years ago, shortly after the emergence of ''H. ergaster'', people more intensively occupied the Eastern Rift Valley; 
* by 1 million years ago, they had extended their range to the far northern and southern margins of Africa.

Traditionally, Homo erectus has been credited as being the prehistoric pioneer, a species that left Africa about 1 million years ago and began to disperse throughout Eurasia. But several important discoveries in the 1990s have reopened the question of when our ancestors first journeyed from Africa to other parts of the globe. Recent evidence now indicates that emigrant erectus made a much earlier departure from Africa.

===Israel===

'''Ubeidiyeh'''
*Deposits accumulated between 1.4-1.0 million years ago;
*Stone tools of both an early chopper-core (or Developed Oldowan) industry and crude Acheulean-like handaxes. The artifacts closely resemble contemporaneous pieces from Upper Bed II at Olduvai Gorge;
*Rare hominid remains attributed to Homo erectus;
*Ubeidiya might reflect a slight ecological enlargement of Africa more than a true human dispersal.

'''Gesher Benot Yaaqov'''
*800,000 years ago;
*No hominid remains;
*Stone tools are of Acheulean tradition and strongly resemble East African industries.

===Republic of Georgia===

In 1991, archaeologists excavating a grain-storage pit in the medieval town of Dmanisi uncovered the lower jaw of an adult erectus, along with animal bones and Oldowan stone tools.

Different dating techniques (paleomagnetism, potassium-argon) gave a date of 1.8 million years ago, that clearly antedate that of Ubeidiya. Also the evidence from Dmanisi suggests now a true migration from Africa.

===China===

'''Longgupo Cave'''
*Dated to 1.8 million years ago
*Fragments of a lower jaw belonging either to Homo erectus or an unspecified early ''Homo''.
*Fossils recovered with Oldowan tools.

'''Zhoukoudian'''
*Dated between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago.
*Remarkable site for providing large numbers of fossils, tools and other artifacts.
*Fossils of ''Homo erectus'' discovered in 1920s and 1930s.

===Java===

In 1994, report of new dates from sites of Modjokerto and Sangiran where ''H. erectus'' had been found in 1891.

Geological age for these hominid remains had been estimated at about 1 million years old. Recent redating of these materials gave dates of 1.8 million years ago for the Modjokerto site and 1.6 million years ago for the Sangiran site.

These dates remained striking due to the absence of any other firm evidence for early humans in East Asia prior to 1 Myrs ago. Yet the individuals from Modjokerto and Sangiran would have certainly traveled through this part of Asia to reach Java.

===Europe===

'''Did Homo ergaster/erectus only head east into Asia, altogether bypassing Europe?'''

Many paleoanthropologists believed until recently that no early humans entered Europe until 500,000 years ago. But the discovery of new fossils from Spain (Atapuerca, Orce) and Italy (Ceprano) secured a more ancient arrival for early humans in Europe.

At Atapuerca, hundreds of flaked stones and roughly eighty human bone fragments were collected from sediments that antedate 780,000 years ago, and an age of about 800,000 years ago is the current best estimate. The artifacts comprise crudely flaked pebbles and simple flakes. The hominid fossils - teeth, jaws, skull fragments - come from several individuals of a new species named Homo antecessor. These craniofacial fragments are striking for derived features that differentiate them from Homo ergaster/erectus, but do not ally them specially with either ''H. neanderthalensis'' or ''H. sapiens''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm starting to write this book because I have a decent grasp of the math behind financial derivatives but I'd like a better one.  It has been my experience that teaching or writing about a subject gives a better comprehension.  I will be drawing heavily on John C. Hull and wikipedia, along with other assorted resources.

I think it is a good idea to write this book. But why did you stop writing on it.
A chapter about Credit Derivatives, Collateralized Debt Obligations, Credit Default Swaps and how to price Synthetic CDO would be nice.

== Financial Math ==

I dont agree that your article displays a very advanced grasp of the mathematics behind financial derivatives. Relying too much on the textbook by Hull risks accusations of plagiarism. --[[User:Tedblack|Tedblack]] 18:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==

If you have ever heard a Korean say &quot;I want to go to the bitch&quot; (meaning &quot;I want to go to the beach&quot;), you should understand the importance of mastering phonetics when learning new languages. To her credit, the Korean is entirely unaware of how she sounds in English. In fact, if you tried to correct her by saying &quot;It's pronounced 'beach'&quot;, she would probably respond with, &quot;That's what I said: bitch.&quot;

As such an example illustrates, few people in our society give conscious thought to the sounds they produce and the subtle differences they possess. It is unfortunate, but hardly surprising, that few language-learning books use technical terminology to describe foreign sounds. Language learners often hear unhelpful advice such as &quot;It is pronounced more ''crisply''&quot;. As scientists, we cannot be satisfied with this state of affairs. If we can classify the sounds of language, we are one step closer to understanding the gestalt of human communication.

The study of the production and perception of speech sounds is a branch of linguistics called ''phonetics'', studied by ''phoneticians''. The study of how languages treat these sounds is called ''phonology'', covered in the next chapter. While these two fields have considerable overlap, it should soon become clear that they differ in important ways.

Phonetics is the systematic study of the human ability to make and hear sounds which use the vocal organs of speech, especially for producing oral language. It is usually divided into the three branches of (1) articulatory, (2) acoustic and (3) auditory phonetics. It is also traditionally differentiated from (though overlaps with) the field of phonology, which is the formal study of the sound systems (phonologies) of languages, especially the universal properties displayed in ALL languages, such as the psycholinguistic aspects of phonological processing and acquisition.

One of the most important tools of phonetics and phonology is a special alphabet called the ''International Phonetic Alphabet'' or ''IPA'', a standardized representation of the sounds used in human language. In this chapter, you will learn what sounds humans use in their languages, and how linguists represent those sounds in IPA. Reading and writing IPA will help you understand what's really happening when people speak.

==Phonetic transcription and the IPA==

It is often convenient to split up speech in a language into ''segments'', which are defined as identifiable units in the flow of speech. In many ways this discretization of speech is somewhat fictional, in that both articulation and the acoustic signal of speech are almost entirely continuous. Additionally, attempts to classify segments by nature must ignore some level of detail, as no two segments produced at separate times are ever identical. Even so, segmentation remains a crucial tool in almost all aspects of linguistics.

In phonetics the most basic segments are called ''phones'', which may be defined as units in speech which can be distinguished acoustically or articulatorily. This definition allows for different degrees of ''wideness''.&lt;ref&gt;A ''wide'' transcription of speech is one which records a relatively large amount of information which is irrelevant to meaning, while a ''narrow'' transcription is closer to a phonemic (see next chapter) transcription.&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts phones may be thought of as acoustic or articulatory ''targets'' which may or may not be fully reached in actual speech. Another, more commonly used segment is the ''phoneme'', which will be defined more precisely in the next chapter.

It is important to keep in mind that while the segment may (or may not) be a reality of phonology; it is in no way an actual physical part of realized speech in the vocal tract. Realized speech is highly co-articulated, displays movement and spreads aspects of sounds over entire syllables and words. It is convenient to think of speech as a succession of segments (which may or may not coincide closely with ideal segments) in order to capture it for discussion in written discourse, but actual phonetic analysis of speech confounds such a model. It should be pointed out, however, that if we wish to set down a representation of dynamic, complex speech into static writing, segmental constructs are very convenient fictions to indicate what we are trying to set down. Similarly, syllables and words are convenient structures which capture the prosodic structure of a language, and are often notated in written form, but are not physical realities.

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a system of phonetic notation which provides a standardized system of transcribing phonetic segments up to a certain degree of detail. It may be represented visually using charts, which may be found in full in Appendix A. We will leave a more detailed description of the IPA to the end of this chapter, but for now just be aware that text in square brackets [] is phonetic transciption in IPA. We will reproduce simplified charts of different subsets of the IPA here as they are explained. 

Variations of IPA such as the well established [[w:Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist phonetic notation]] and a new,  simplified international version called [[w:SaypU|SaypU]] are available, but IPA is more comprehensive and so preferred for educational use, despite its complexity.

To understand the IPA's taxonomy of phones, it is important to consider articulatory, acoustic, and auditory phonetics.

==Articulatory phonetics==  

Articulatory phonetics is concerned with how the sounds of language are physically produced by the vocal apparatus. The units articulatory phonetics deals with are known as ''gestures'', which are abstract characterizations of articulatory events.

Speaking in terms of articulation, the sounds that we utter to make language can be split into two different types: consonants and vowels. For the purposes of articulatory phonetics, consonant sounds are typically characterized as sounds that have constricted or closed configurations of the vocal tract. Vowels, on the other hand, are characterized in articulatory terms as having relatively little constriction; that is, an open configuration of the vocal tract. Vowels carry much of the pitch of speech and can be held different durations, such as a half a beat, one beat, two beats, three beats, etc. of speech rhythm. Consonants, on the other hand, do not carry the prosodic pitch (especially if devoiced and not nasalized) and do not display the potential for the durations that vowels can have. Linguists may also speak of 'semi-vowels' or 'semi-consonants' (often used as synonymous terms). For example, a sound such as [w] phonetically seems more like a vowel (with relative lack of constriction or closure of the vocal tract) but, phonologically speaking, behaves as a consonant in that it always appears before a vowel sound at the beginning (onset) of a syllable.

===Consonants===

Phoneticians generally characterize consonants as being distinguished by settings of the independent variables ''place of articulation'' (POA) and ''manner of articulation'' (MOA). In layman's terminology, POA is &quot;where&quot; the consonant is produced, while MOA is &quot;how&quot; the consonant is produced.

The following are descriptions of the different POAs:
[[Image:Places_of_articulation.svg|thumb|A diagram of the vocal tract showing the different places of articulation]]
*'''Bilabial''' segments are produced with the lips held together, for instance the [p] sound of the English '''''p'''in'', or the [b] sound in '''''b'''in''.
*'''Labiodental''' segments are produced by holding the upper teeth to the lower lip, like in the [f] sound of English '''''f'''in''.
*'''Dental''' consonants have the tongue making contact with the upper teeth (area 3 in the diagram). An example from English is the [θ] sound in the word '''''th'''in''.
*'''Alveolar''' consonants have the tongue touching the area of the mouth known as the alveolar ridge (area 4 in the diagram). Examples include the [t] in '''''t'''in'' and [s] in '''''s'''in''.
*'''Postalveolar''' consonants are similar to alveolars but more retracted (in area 5 in the diagram), like the [ʃ] of '''''sh'''in''.
*'''Palatal''' consonants are articulated at the hard palate (the middle part of the roof of the mouth, area 7 in the diagram). In English the palatal [j] sound appears in the word '''''y'''oung''.
*'''Velar''' consonants are articulated at the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth, known also as the ''velum'', area 8 in the diagram). English [k] is velar, like in the word '''''k'''in''.
*'''Glottal''' consonants are articulated far back in the throat, at the ''glottis'' (area 11 in the diagram, effectively the vocal folds). English [h] may be regarded as glottal.&lt;ref&gt;In actuality many argue that [h] has no POA. This will be ignored for our purposes.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Doubly articulated''' consonants have two points of articulation, such as the English labio-velar [w] of '''''w'''it''. 

Other POAs are also possible, but will be described in more detail later on.

MOA involves a number of different variables which may vary independently:
*'''Voicing''': Try pronouncing the hissing sound [s] of the English word '''''s'''ip''. Elongate the sound until you can produce it continuously for five seconds. Then do the same for the [z] sound in '''''z'''ip''. Hold your hand to your throat, observing the different in tactile sensation between the two. you should notice that [z] creates vibrations, while [s] does not. This rapid vibration is in fact caused by the ''vocal folds'', and it is referred to as ''voicing''. Many different sounds can contrast solely based on a voicing difference: English [b, p] in '''''b'''in'', '''''p'''in'', [d, t] in '''''d'''in'', '''''t'''in'', et cetera.

*'''Nasality''': Some sounds are produced with airflow through the nasal cavity. These are known as ''nasals''. Nasal consonants in English include the [n] of '''''n'''ot'', the [m] of '''''m'''it'', and the [ŋ] of ''si'''ng'''''. Nasals may also contrast for voicing in some languages, but this is rare &amp;mdash; in most languages, nasals are voiced.

*'''Obstruency''': Consonants involving a total obstruction of airflow are known as ''stops'' or ''plosives''. Examples include English [p, b, t, d, k, g]. ''Fricatives'' are consonants with a steady stricture causing friction, for example [f, v, s, z, ʃ, ʒ]. ''Affricates'' begin with a stop-like closure followed by frication, like the [tʃ, dʒ] of English '''''ch'''ip'', '''''j'''eans''.

*'''Sonorancy''': Non-obstruents are classed as sonorants. This includes the already-mentioned nasals. Another important type of sonorant found in English is the approximant, in which articulatory organs produce a narrowing of the vocal tract, but leave enough space for air to flow without much audible turbulence. Examples include English [w, j, l, ɹ].

Knowing this information is enough to construct a simplified IPA chart of the consonants of English. As is conventional, MOA is organized in rows, and POA columns. Voicing pairs occur in the same cells; the ones in bold are voiced while the rest are voiceless.

Vowels are very different from consonants, but our method of decomposing sounds into sets of features works equally well. Vowels can essentially be viewed as being combinations of three variables:
*'''Height''': This measured how close your tongue is to the roof of your mouth. For example, try pronouncing [æ] (as in &quot;cat&quot;) and [i] (as in &quot;feet&quot;). Your mouth should be much more open for the former than the latter. Thus [æ] is called either ''open'' or ''low'', and [i] either ''closed'' or ''high''.
*'''Backness''': This is what is sounds like. Try, for example, alternating between pronouncing the vowels [æ] (as in &quot;cat&quot;) and [ɑ] (as in &quot;cot&quot;), and get a feel for the position of your tongue in your mouth. It should move forward for [æ] and back for [ɑ], which is why the former is called a ''front'' vowel and the latter a ''back'' vowel.
*'''Rounding''':  Pronouncing the vowels [i] and [u], and look at your lips in a mirror. They should look puckered up for [u] and spread out for /i/.&lt;ref&gt;[i] and [u] are also distinguished by backness, but in many languages certain vowels may be distinguished only by rounding.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, this &quot;puckering&quot; is referred to in phonetics as ''rounding''.

Back vowels&lt;ref&gt;[ɑ] is something of an exception&lt;/ref&gt; tend to be rounded, and front vowels unrounded, for reasons which will be covered later in this chapter. However, this tendency is not universal. For instance, the vowel in the French word ''bœuf'' is what would result from the vowel of the English word ''bet'' being pronounced with rounding. Some East and Southeast Asian languages possess unrounded back vowels, which are difficult to describe without a sound sample.&lt;ref&gt;Compare close back rounded [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Close_back_rounded_vowel.ogg [u]] and unrounded [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Close_back_unrounded_vowel.ogg [ɯ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''cardinal vowels'' are a set of idealized vowels used by phoneticians as a base of reference.

The IPA orders the vowel in a similar way to the consonants, separating the three main distinguishing variables into different dimensions. The ''vowel trapezoid'' may be thought of as a rough diagram of the mouth, with the left being the front, the right the back, and the vertical direction representing height in the mouth. Each vowel is positioned thusly based on height and backness. Rounding isn't indicated by location, but when pairs of vowels sharing the same height and backness occur next to each other, the left member is always unrounded, and the right a rounded vowel. Otherwise, just use the general heuristic that rounded vowels are usually back. The following is a simplified version of the IPA vowel chart:

Many of these vowels will be familiar from (General American) English. The following are rough examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! [æ]
| c''a''t
! [ɑ]
| c''o''t
! [ɐ]
| c''u''t
|-
! [ɛ]
| k''e''lp
! [ə]
| carr''o''t
! [ɔ]
| c''au''ght
|-
! [e]
| c''a''ke
! [o]
| c''oa''t
! [ɪ]
| k''i''n
|-
! [ʊ]
| c''u''shion
! [i]
| k''ee''p
! [u]
| c''oo''l
|}
Note, however, that in phonetics we can describe any segment in arbitrarily fine detail. As such, when we say that, say, the vowel in &quot;cat&quot; ''is'' [æ], we are sacrificing precision.

Some of these vowels have no English equivalent, but may be familiar from foreign languages. [a] represents the sound in Spanish &quot;h''a''blo&quot;, the front rounded [œ] vowel is that in French &quot;b''œu''f&quot;, [y] is that of German &quot;h''ü''ten&quot;, and [ɯ] (perhaps the most exotic to most English speakers) is found as the first vowel of European Portuguese &quot;p''e''gar&quot;.

==Other types of phonetics==

===Acoustic phonetics ===
Acoustic phonetics deals with the physical medium of speech -- that is, how speech manipulates sound waves.

Sound is composed of waves of high- and low-pressure areas which propagate through air. The most basic way to view sound is as a ''wave function''. This plots the pressure measured by the sound-recording device against time, corresponding closely to the physical nature of sound. Loudness may be found by looking at the ''amplitude'' of the sound at a given time.

However, this approach is fairly limited. Humans, in fact, don't process sound using this raw data. The ear analyzes sound by decomposing it into its constituent frequencies, a mathematical algorithm known as the ''Fourier transform''.

As a sound is produced in the oral tract, the column of air in the tract serves as a ''harmonic oscillator'', oscillating at numerous frequencies simultaneously. Some of the frequencies of oscillation are at higher amplitudes than others, a property called ''resonance''. The ''resonant frequencies'' (frequencies with relatively high resonance) of the vocal tract are known in phonetics as ''formants''&lt;ref&gt;Resonant frequencies are more commonly known as ''overtones'' in general acoustics. Don't confuse these with ''harmonics'', which are a somewhat different concept.&lt;/ref&gt;. The formants in a speech sound are numbered by their frequency: f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (pronounced ''eff-one'') has the lowest frequency, followed by f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. The analysis of formants turns out to be key to acoustic phonetics, as any change in the shape of the vocal cavity changes which resonances are dominant.

There are two basic ways to analyze the formants of a speech signal. Firstly, at any given time the sound contains a mixture of different frequencies of sound. The relative amplitudes (strengths) of different frequencies at a particular time may be shown as a ''frequency spectrum''. As you can see on the right, frequency is plotted against amplitude, and formants show up as peaks.

[[Image:Spectrogram -iua-.png|250px|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Another way to view formants is by using a ''spectrogram''. This plots time against frequency, with amplitude represented by darkness. Formants show up as dark bands, and their movement may be tracked through time.

Given the development of modern technology, acoustic analysis is now accessible to anyone with a computer and a microphone.&lt;ref&gt;A commonly-used acoustic analysis tool (&quot;praat&quot;) can be downloaded for free here: http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditory phonetics===
Auditory phonetics is a branch of phonetics concerned with the hearing of speech sounds and with speech perception.

==As a learner==

Children learn the sounds made in their native language within their first year, and after this it becomes difficult to produce sounds foreign to their native languages. Even familiar segments are produced without reflection on the manner of their production. As such, it is highly recommended that you practice pronouncing isolated segments, and listen repeatedly to examples of those which seem exotic to you. Soon, you will be noticing yourself becoming more observant as to the phones you hear in your everyday life, and will be less puzzled by unfamiliar segments in other languages.

== Workbook section ==

=== Exercise 1: English Places of Articulation ===

The following English words were tagged with the place of articulation of their first segment, but the tags have been scrambled. Match each word with the correct POA:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| cake || rowspan=10 width=&quot;100px&quot; | || palatal
|-
| bleed || alveolar
|-
| zip || alveolar
|-
| food || dental
|-
| shack || bilabial
|-
| team || velar
|-
| thin || labio-velar
|-
| wipe || retroflex
|-
| yam || post-alveolar
|-
| read || labio-dental
|}

=== Exercise 2: Brezhoneg ===

The following text in the Breton language has been translated into English:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Ar brezhoneg a zo ur [[w:Brythonic Languages|yezh predenek]] eus skourr ar yezhoù keltiek komzet en darn vrasañ eus Enez Vreizh abaoe an Henamzer betek an aloubadegoù Saoz. Tost eo tre d'ar c'herneveureg (Cornwall:Kernow) ha d'ar c'hembraeg (Wales:Cymru) ha nebeutoc'h d'ar yezhoù keltiek all a zo c'hoazh bev : Skoseg, Gouezeleg ha Manaveg (Scotland, Ireland, Isle of Man) (ar skourr gouezelek).&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Breton is a [[w:Brythonic Languages|Brythonic language]] belonging to the branch of Celtic spoken over most of Britain from prehistoric times until the Saxon invasions. It is closely related to Cornish (Cornwall:Kernow) and Welsh (Wales:Cymru) and more distantly to the other surviving Celtic languages, Scots, Irish and Manx Gaelic (Scotland, Ireland, Isle of Man) (The Goidelic group).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You have been commissioned to create a phonetic transcription of this text using the following recording of a native speaker:

&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:06 Brezhoneg.ogg]]&lt;br/&gt;

Write the transcription, being as accurate as you can. (Hint: The Breton rhotic is similar to that of French.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">We briefly mentioned [[../Asymmetric Ciphers/]] earlier in this book. In this and following chapters we will describe how they work in much more detail.

The discovery of '''public key cryptography''' revolutionized the practice of cryptography in the 1970s.
In public key cryptography, the key used to encrypt a message is not the same as the key used to decrypt it.
This requires an asymmetric key algorithm.

(All previous cryptographic algorithms and cryptosystems, now retroactively categorized as &quot;symmetric key cryptography&quot; or &quot;shared key cryptography&quot;, always use the same key to encrypt a message and later to decrypt that message).

'''Public key cryptography''' is cryptography where the key exchange process betweeen person A and person B must not be kept secret. Private keys actually are never exchanged. In fact Person A sends information (possibly about a session key) to Person B so that it is only interpretable to Person B. An intruder cannot discover the meaning of the exchange because Person B has a piece of information that the intruder does not. Person A didn't access Person B's secret information(private key) either he only indirectly accessed it via a &quot;public&quot; key. The public key is formed from the private key by using a One Way Function.

The concepts behind public key cryptography are best expressed by a simple puzzle. 

''Alice wants to send a trinket to Bob without an intruder stealing it. Each person has a lock and a key.'' 
'''A Non-Public Key Solution'''
#Alice puts her key in the box and sends to Bob.
#Bob copies the key and sends it back.
#Alice sends the trinket in a locked box.
#Bob opens the box with the copied key.

This solution, although the most intuitive, suffers from a major problem. The intruder could monitor  the boxes and copy the key as it sent. If an intruder has Alice's key the trinket or anythin else will be stolen in transit. To some the puzzle seems impossible, but those who understand public key cryptography solve it easily. 
'''Public Key Solution'''
#Alice puts the trinket in a box, locks it and sends it to Bob.
#Bob locks the box again with his lock and sends the box back.
#Alice removes her lock and sends it to Bob.
#Bob removes the final lock and takes the trinket.
The puzzle's trick is double locking the box.

This back-and-forth &quot;double lock&quot; process is used in many asymmetric key algorithms, such as ElGamal encryption and Diffie-Hellman key exchange, but not all of them.

This is the double lock principle, but it is not Public Cryptography as both keys are secret. In public cryptography one key is public, the other is secret. Nobody knowing the public key is able to decipher a message encrypted with a public key. Only the secret key is able to decipher a message encrypted with a public key.

A real-world analogy to public keys would be the padlock. The padlock can be easily closed, but it is much harder to do the reverse, namely opening. It is not impossible, but it requires much more effort to open it than to close it, assuming you don't have the (private) key. Alice could send Bob an open padlock by mail (the equivalent to the public key). Bob then puts a message for Alice into a box and locks the box with the padlock. Now, Bob sends the locked box back to Alice and Alice opens it with her private key.

Note that this approach is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. If Charles intercepts the mail with Alice's padlock and replaces it with his own padlock, Bob will lock the box with the wrong padlock and Charles will be able to intercept the answer. Charles could then even lock the box again with Alice's padlock and forward the box to Alice. That way, she will never notice that the message got intercepted. This illustrates that it is very important to obtain public keys (the padlocks) from a trusted source. That's what certificates are for. They come along with the public keys and basically say something like 'I, Microsoft, hereby confirm that this padlock belongs to Alice', and are signed using secure digital signatures.

So someone (Bob) is able to send securely an encrypted data to Alice, if Alice had made her key public.

Bob is able to prove that he owns a secret key only by providing:

* a plain text 
* the same text crypted with the secret key 
* the public key corresponding to the secret key. 

Something similar to the double lock principle is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Puzzles Merkle's puzzle], which is the ancestor of the Diffie-hellman key exchange, which is itself a close cousin to RSA public key system.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==The hominids==
===African ''Homo erectus'': ''Homo ergaster''===

''H. ergaster'' existed between 1.8 million and 1.3 million years ago.

Like ''H. habilis'', the face shows:
*protruding jaws with large molars;
*no chin;
*thick brow ridges;
*long low skull, with a brain size varying between 750 and 1225 cc.
[[File:Turkana boy - steps of forensic facial reconstruction RTL.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Facial reconstruction of Turkana Boy]]
Early ''H. ergaster'' specimens average about 900 cc, while late ones have an
average of about 1100 cc. The skeleton is more robust than those of modern humans, implying
greater strength.
[[File:Skeleton and restoration model of Turkana Boy.jpg|thumb|right|Turkana Boy skeleton and restoration model]]
Body proportions vary:
:Ex. Turkana Boy is tall and slender, like modern humans from the same area, while the few limb bones found of Peking Man indicate a shorter, sturdier build.

Study of the Turkana Boy skeleton indicates that H. ergaster may have
been more efficient at walking than modern humans, whose skeletons have had
to adapt to allow for the birth of larger-brained infants.

''Homo habilis'' and all the australopithecines are found only in Africa, but
H. erectus/ergaster was wide-ranging, and has been found in Africa, Asia,
and Europe.

===Asian ''Homo erectus''===
[[File:Peking_Man_Skull_(replica)_presented_at_Paleozoological_Museum_of_China.jpg|thumb|right|Replica skull of &quot;Peking Man&quot;, an Asian ''Homo Erectus'']]
Specimens of ''H. erectus'' from Eastern Asia differ morphologically from
African specimens:
*features are more exaggerated;
*skull is thicker, brow ridges are more pronounced, sides of skull slope more steeply, the sagittal crest is more exaggerated;
*Asian forms do not show the increase in cranial capacity.

As a consequence of these features, they are less like humans than the African forms of ''H. erectus''.

Paleoanthropologists who study extinct populations are forced to decide
whether there was one species or two based on morphological traits alone.
They must ask whether eastern and western forms are as different from each
other as typical species.

If systematics finally agree that eastern and western populations of ''H. erectus'' are distinct species, then the eastern Asian form will keep the name ''H. erectus''. The western forms have been given a new name: ''Homo ergaster'' (means &quot;work man&quot;) and was first applied to a very old specimen from East Turkana in East Africa.

===''Homo georgicus''===

Specimens recovered recently exhibit characteristic ''H. erectus'' features:
sagittal crest, marked constriction of the skull behind the eyes.
But they are also extremely different in several ways, resembling ''H. habilis'':
* small brain size (600 cc);
* prominent browridge;
* projection of the face;
* rounded contour of the rear of skull;
* huge canine teeth.

Some researchers propose that these fossils might represent a new species of Homo: ''H. georgicus''.

===''Homo antecessor''===

Named in 1997 from fossils (juvenile specimen) found in Atapuerca (Spain). Dated to at least 780,000 years ago, it makes these fossils the oldest confirmed European hominids.

Mid-facial area of antecessor seems very modern, but other parts of skull
(e.g., teeth, forehead and browridges) are much more primitive.
Fossils assigned to new species on grounds that they exhibit unknown
combination of traits: they are less derived in the Neanderthal direction
than later mid-Quaternary European specimens assigned to Homo
heidelbergensis.

===''Homo heidelbergensis''===

Archaic forms of Homo sapiens first appeared in Europe about 500,000
years ago (until about 200,000 years ago) and are called Homo
heidelbergensis.

Found in various places in Europe, Africa and maybe Asia.

This species covers a diverse group of skulls which have features of both
Homo erectus and modern humans.
[[File:Homo_heidelbergensis_-_forensic_facial_reconstruction.png|thumb|300px|right|Facial reconstruction of ''Homo Heidelbergensis'']]
Fossil features:
*brain size is larger than erectus and smaller than most modern humans: averaging about 1200 cc;
*skull is more rounded than in erectus;
*still large brow ridges and receding foreheads;
*skeleton and teeth are usually less robust than erectus, but more robust than modern humans;
*mandible is human-like, but massive and chinless; shows expansion of molar cavities and very long cheek tooth row, which implies a long, forwardly projecting face.

Fossils could represent a population near the common ancestry of
Neanderthals and modern humans.

Footprints of H. heidelbergensis (earliest human footprints) have been found in
Italy in 2003.

==Phylogenic relationships==

For almost three decades, paleoanthropologists have often divided the
genus Homo among three successive species:
*''Homo habilis'', now dated between roughly 2.5 Myrs and 1.7 Myrs ago;
*''Homo erectus'', now placed between roughly 1.7 Myrs and 500,000 years ago;
*''Homo sapiens'', after 500,000 years ago.

In this view, each species was distinguished from its predecessor primarily
by larger brain size and by details of cranio-facial morphology:
:Ex. Change in braincase shape from more rounded in ''H. habilis'' to more angular in H. erectus to more rounded again in ''H. sapiens''.
[[File:Homo-Stammbaum,_Version_Stringer-en.svg|thumb|right|A hypothesised family tree for ''Homo'', proposed in 2012]]
The accumulating evidence of fossils has increasingly undermined a
scenario based on three successive species or evolutionary stages. It now
strongly favors a scheme that more explicitly recognizes the importance of
branching in the evolution of Homo.

This new scheme continues to accept ''H. habilis'' as the ancestor for all
later Homo. Its descendants at 1.8-1.7 million mears ago may still be called H. erectus, but H.
ergaster is now more widely accepted.
By 600,000-500,000  years ago, ''H. ergaster'' had produced several lines
leading to H. neanderthalensis in Europe and ''H. sapiens'' in Africa. About
600,000 years ago, both of these species shared a common ancestor to which
the name H. heidelbergensis could be applied.

==&quot;Out-of-Africa 1&quot; model==

Homo erectus in Asia would be as old as Homo ergaster in Africa. Do the new dates from Dmanisi and Java falsify the hypothesis of an African origin for ''Homo erectus''? Not necessarily.

If the species evolved just slightly earlier than the oldest African
fossils (2.0-1.9 million years ago) and then immediately began its geographic spread, it
could have reached Europe and Asia fairly quickly.

But the &quot;Out-of-Africa 1&quot; migration is more complex. Conventional
paleoanthropological wisdom holds that the first human to leave Africa were
tall, large-brained hominids (''Homo ergaster/erectus''). New fossils
discovered in Georgia (Dmanisi) are forcing scholars to rethink that
scenario completely. These Georgian hominids are far smaller and more
primitive in both anatomy and technology than expected, leaving experts
wondering not only why early humans first ventured out of Africa, but also how.

==Summary==
''Homo ergaster'' was the first hominid species whose anatomy fully justify
the label human:
*Unlike australopithecines and ''Homo habilis'', in which body form and proportions retained apelike features suggesting a continued reliance on trees for food or refuge, ''H. ergaster'' achieved essentially modern forms and proportions;
*Members also differed from australopithecines and'' H. habilis'' in their increased, essentially modern stature and in their reduced degree of sexual dimorphism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Because of this, the concept of an ecological niche does not apply to humans anymore.''

I think this is debatable, and should probably be removed. We can operate outside our ecological niche -- on submarines in the ocean or scuba diving with breathing tanks, with special cold-weather equipment on the highest mountains or even on spacecraft beyond the atmosphere -- but we still have an ecological niche.

Also, I think it might be wise in this first chapter to either avoid using the hominoid/hominid/hominin terms completely or else take the time to define them right off. It can be confusing enough to remember which is which even when you know what they are, much less if you're new to the field and don't realize they're really separate terms and not just variant spellings of the same term.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 02:45, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

{{displaytitle|title=Acheulean Technology and Subsistence}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
''Homo ergaster/erectus'', the author of the Acheulean industry, enjoyed impressive longevity as a species and great geographic spread. We will review several cultural innovations and behavioral changes that might have contributed to the success of ''H. ergaster/erectus'':
*stone-knapping advances that resulted in Acheulean bifacial tools;
*the beginnings of shelter construction;
*the control and use of fire;
*increased dependence on hunting.

==The Acheulean industrial complex==
(1.7 million - 200,000 years ago)

===Stone tools===
By the time ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' appeared, Oldowan choppers and flake tools had been in use for 800,000 years. For another 100,000 to 400,000 years, Oldowan tools continued to be the top-of-the-line implements for early ''Homo ergaster/erectus''. Between 1.7 and 1.4 million years ago, Africa witnessed a significant advance in stone tool technology: the development of the Acheulean industry.
[[File:Biface Cintegabelle MHNT PRE 2009.0.201.1 V2.jpg|thumb|right|Acheulean biface discovered in Haute-Garonne, France]]
The Acheulean tool kit included:
*picks;
*cleavers;
*an assortment of Oldowan-type choppers and flakes, suggesting that the more primitive implements continued to serve important functions;
*mainly characterized by bifacially flaked tools, called bifaces.

A biface reveals a cutting edge that has been flaked carefully on both sides to make it straighter and sharper than the primitive Oldowan chopper. The purpose of the two-sided, or bifacial, method was to change the shape of the core from essentially round to flattish, for only with a flat stone can one get a decent cutting edge.

One technological improvement that permitted the more controlled working required to shape an Acheulean handax was the gradual implementation, during the Acheulean period, of different kinds of hammers. In earlier times, the toolmaker knocked flakes from the core with another piece of stone. The hard shock of rock on rock tended to leave deep, irregular scars and wavy cutting edges.

But a wood or bone hammer, being softer, gave its user much greater control over flaking. Such implements left shallower, cleaner scars and produced sharper and straighter cutting edges.
::'''With the Acheulean Industry, the use of stone (hard hammer) was pretty much restricted to the preliminary rough shaping of a handax, and all the fine work around the edges was done with wood and bone.'''

Acheulean handaxes and cleavers are generally interpreted as being implements for processing animal carcasses. Even though cleavers could have been used to chop and shape wood, their wear patterns are more suggestive of use on soft material, such as hides and meat. Acheulean tools represent an adaptation for habitual and systematic butchery, and especially the dismembering of large animal carcasses, as ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' experienced a strong dietary shift toward more meat consumption.

Acheulean tools originated in Africa between 1.7 and 1.4 million years ago. They were then produced continuously throughout ''Homo ergaster/erectus' '' long African residency and beyond, finally disappearing about 200,000 years ago.

Generally, Acheulean tools from sites clearly older than 400,000 to 500,000 years ago are attributed to Homo ergaster/erectus, even in the absence of confirming fossils. At several important Late Acheulean sites, however, the toolmakers' species identity remains ambiguous because the sites lack hominid fossils and they date to a period when ''Homo erectus'' and archaic ''Homo sapiens'' (e.g., ''Homo heidelbergensis'') overlapped in time.

===Other raw materials===
Stone artifacts dominate the Paleolithic record because of their durability, but early people surely used other raw materials, including bone and more perishable substances like wood, reeds, and skin.

A few sites, mainly European, have produced wooden artifacts, which date usually between roughly 600,000 and 300,000 years ago:
::Ex. At the site of Schöningen, Germany, several wooden throwing spears, over 2 m long. They arguably present the oldest, most compelling case for early human hunting.

==Diffusion of Technology==

Wide variability in stone tools present with ''H. erectus''. In Eastern Asia, H. erectus specimens are associated not with Acheulean tools, but instead with Oldowan tools, which were retained until 200,000 to 300,000 years ago.

This pattern was first pointed out by Hallam Movius in 1948. The line dividing the Old World into Acheulean and non-Acheulean regions became known as the Movius line. Handax cultures flourished to the west and south of the line, but in the east, only choppers and flake tools were found.

Why were there no Acheulean handax cultures in the Eastern provinces of Asia?
*history of research;
*other explanations:
**quality of raw materials (fine-grained rocks rare)
**different functional requirements (related to
**environment and food procurement)
**&quot;bamboo culture&quot;: bamboo tools used in place of
**stone implements to perform tasks;
*Early dates in Java and Dmanisi explain situation
::Acheulean developed in Africa from the preceding Oldowan Tradition only after 1.8 Myrs ago, but if people moved into eastern Asia at 1.8 million years ago or before, they would have arrived without Acheulean tools.

In sum, while the Acheulean tradition, with its handaxes and cleavers, was an important lithic advance by Homo ergaster over older technologies, it constituted only one of several adaptive patterns used by the species. Clever and behaviorally flexible, H. ergaster was capable of adjusting its material culture to local resources and functional requirements.

==Subsistence patterns and diet==
Early discoveries of Homo ergaster/erectus fossils in association with stone tools and animal bones lent themselves to the interpretation of hunting and gathering way of life. Nevertheless this interpretation is not accepted by all scholars and various models have been offered to make sense of the evidence.

===First Scenario: Scavenging===

Recently, several of the original studies describing ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' as a hunter-gatherer have come under intense criticism. Re-examination of the material at some of the sites convinced some scholars (L. Binford) that faunal assemblages were primarily the result of animal activity rather than hunting and gathering.

Animal bones showed cut marks from stone tools that overlay gnaw marks by carnivores, suggesting that ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' was not above scavenging parts of a carnivore kill.

According to these scholars, at most sites, the evidence for scavenging by hominids is much more convincing than is that for actual hunting.

===Which scenario to choose?===

The key point here is not that ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' were the first hominid hunters, but that they depended on meat for a much larger portion of their diet than had any previous hominid species.

Occasional hunting is seen among nonhuman primates and cannot be denied to australopithecines (see ''[[Introduction to Paleoanthropology/Hominids Early#Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]''). But apparently for ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' hunting took an unprecedented importance, and in doing so it must have played a major role in shaping both material culture and society.

==Shelter and fire==
For years, scientists have searched for evidence that ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' had gained additional controlled over its environment through the construction of shelters, and the control and use of fire. The evidence is sparse and difficult to interpret.

===Shelter===

Seemingly patterned arrangements or concentrations of large rocks at sites in Europe and Africa may mark the foundations of huts or windbreaks, but in each case the responsible agent could equally well be stream flow, or any other natural process.

Therefore there appears to be no convincing evidence that ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' regularly constructed huts, windbreaks, or any other sort of shelter during the bulk of its long period of existence. Shelter construction apparently developed late in the species' life span, if at all, and therefore cannot be used as an explanation of ''H. ergaster's'' capacity for geographic expansion.

===Fire===
Proving the evidence of fire by ''Homo ergaster/erectus'' is almost equally problematic. Some researchers have suggested that the oldest evidence for fire use comes from some Kenyan sites dated about 1.4 to 1.6 million years ago. Other scholars are not sure. The problem is that the baked earth found at these sites could have been produced as easily by natural fires as by fires started - or at least controlled - by ''H. ergaster/erectus''.

Better evidence of fire use comes from sites that date near the end of ''Homo erectus' '' existence as a species. Unfortunately, the identity of the responsible hominids (either Homo erectus or archaic Homo sapiens) is unclear.

The evidence at present suggests that fire was not a key to either the geographic spread or the longevity of these early humans.

==Out-of-Africa 1: Behavioral aspects==
Researchers proposed originally that it was not until the advent of handaxes and other symmetrically shaped, standardized stone tools that ''H. erectus'' could penetrate the northern latitudes. Exactly what, if anything, these implements could accomplish that the simple Oldowan flakes, choppers and scrapers that preceded them could not is unknown, although perhaps they conferred a better means of butchering.

But the Dmanisi finds of primitive hominids and Oldowan-like industries raise once again the question of what prompted our ancestors to leave their natal land.

Yet, there is one major problem with scenarios involving departure dates earlier than about 1.7-1.4 million years ago, and that is simply that they involve geographic spread before the cultural developments (Acheulean industry, meat eating, fire, shelter) that are supposed to have made it possible.

A shift toward meat eating might explain how humans managed to survive outside of Africa, but what prompted them to push into new territories remains unknown at this time.

Perhaps they were following herds of animal north. Or maybe it was as simple and familiar as a need to know what lay beyond that hill or river or tall savanna grass. Also an early migration could explain technological differences between western and eastern Homo erectus populations.

The link between butchering tools and moves into northern latitudes is the skinning and preparation of hides and furs, for reworking 1. into portable shelters, and 2. into clothing. more skilful skinning meant that skins would be better preserved, while fire would lead to meat preservation (smoking) by the simple need to hang cuts of butchered meat high up out of reach of any scavenging animals within smoke filled caves or other dwellings. 
Having smoked meat then allowed deeper incursions into otherwise hostile terrain, or  a long-term food supply available in harsh winters.
With readily available and storable energy resources, and protective clothing, they could push out into harsh northern latitudes with comparative ease.

==Summary==

Overall, the evidence suggests that ''Homo ergaster'' was the first hominid species to resemble historic hunter-gatherers not only in a fully terrestrial lifestyle, but also in a social organization that featured economic cooperation between males and females and perhaps between semi-permanent male-female units.

: Thanks for your valuable input (and copyediting). I agree with your notes on pulling out some of the chapters. I am re-organizing the book now, and think I will have them as suggested reading. As for the POV stuff, I think the issues need to be raised, but the language should be toned down with &quot;some think&quot; or &quot;an argument can be made that...&quot;-type stuff. Sure, they are weasle words, but I think it would be worse than to just leave the issues out altogether. I still have a couple more chapters to do. Unfortunately they are still in outline form from my laptop's notes.  I probably will just put those notes up to finish the book in rough form - then work on fleshing them out later.

{{PaleoIntro}}
{{displaytitle|title=Modern Human Variation and Adaptation}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
One of the notable characteristics of the human species today is its great variability. Human diversity has long fascinated people, but unfortunately it also has
led to discrimination. In this chapter we will attempt to address the following questions:
*''What are the causes of physical variability in modern animals?''
*''Is the concept of race useful for studying human physical variation?''
*''Are there differences in intelligence from one population to another?''

==Variation and evolution==
Human genetic variation generally is distributed in such a continuous range, with varying clusters of frequency.
::Ex. Our hair is curly or straight, our skin is lightly to heavily pigmented, and in height we range from short to tall.

The significance we give our variations, the way we perceive them (in fact, whether or not we perceive them at all) is determined by our culture.

Many behavioral traits are learned or acquired by living in a society; other characteristics, such as blue eyes, are passed on physically by heredity. Environment affects both.

The physical characteristics of both populations and individuals are a product of the interaction between genes and environments.
::''Ex. One's genes predispose one to a particular skin color, but the skin color one actually has is strongly affected by environmental factors such as the amount of solar radiation.''

For most characteristics, there are within the gene pool of Homo sapiens
variant forms of genes, known as alleles.
::In the color of an eye, the shape of a hand, the texture of skin, many variations can occur.

This kind of variability, found in many animal species, signifies a rich potential for new combinations of characteristics in future generations. A species faced with changing environmental conditions has within its gene pool the possibility of producing individuals with traits appropriate to its altered life. Many may not achieve reproductive success, but those
whose physical characteristics enable them to do well in the new environment will usually reproduce, so that their genes will become more common in subsequent generations. Thus, humankind has been able to occupy a variety of environments.

A major expansion into new environments was under way by the time ''Homo erectus'' appeared on the scene. Populations of this species were living in Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe and China. The differentiation of animal life is the result of selective pressures that, through the Pleistocene, differed from one region to another. Coupled with differing selective pressures were geographical features that restricted or prevented gene flow between populations of different faunal regions.
::''Ex. The conditions of life were quite different in China, which lies in the temperate zone, than they were in tropical Southeast Asia.''

Genetic variants will be expressed in different frequencies in these geographically dispersed populations.
::''Ex. In the Old World, populations of Homo sapiens living in the tropics have a higher frequency of genes for dark skin than do those living in more northerly regions.''

In blood type, H. sapiens shows four distinct groups (A, B, O or AB):
*The frequency of the O allele is highest in Native Americans, especially among some populations native to South America;
*The highest frequencies of the allele for Type A tend to be found among certain European populations;
*The highest frequencies of the B allele are found in some Asian populations.

==The Meaning of Race==
Early anthropologists tried to explore the nature of human species by systematically classifying H. sapiens into subspecies or races, based on geographic location and physical features such as skin color, body size, head shape and hair texture. Such classifications were continually challenged by the presence of individuals who did not fit the categories.

The fact is, generalized references to human types such as &quot;Asiatic&quot; or &quot;Mongoloid&quot;, &quot;European&quot; or &quot;Caucasoid&quot;, and &quot;African&quot; or &quot;Negroid&quot; were at best mere statistical abstractions about populations in which certain physical features appeared in higher frequencies than in other populations.
:'''No example of &quot;pure&quot; racial types could be found.'''

These categories turned out to be neither definitive nor particularly helpful. The visible traits were found to occur not in abrupt shifts from population to population, but in a continuum that changed gradually. Also one trait might change gradually over a north-south gradient, while another might show a similar change from east to west.
:'''Human skin color becomes progressively darker as one moves from northern Europe to central Africa, while blood type B becomes progressively more common as one moves from western to eastern Europe.'''

==Race as a biological concept==
To understand why the racial approach to human variation has been so unproductive, we must first understand the race concept in strictly biological terms.

In biology, a race is defined as a population of a species that differs in the frequency of different variants of some gene or genes from other populations of the same species. Three important things to note about this definition:
*it is arbitrary. There is no agreement on how many genetic differences it takes to make a race. For some, different frequencies in the variants of one gene are sufficient; for others, differences in frequencies involving several genes were necessary. The number of genes and precisely which ones are the more important for defining races are still open to debate;
*it does not mean that any race has exclusive possession of any particular variant of any gene or genes. In human terms, the frequency of the allele for blood group O may be high in one population and low in another, but it is present in both. Races are genetically &quot;open&quot;, meaning that gene flow takes place between them. Thus one can easily see the fallacy of any attempt to identify &quot;pure&quot; races: if gene flow cannot take place between two populations, either directly or indirectly through intermediate populations, then they are not races, but are separate species;
*individuals of one race will not necessarily be distinguishable from those of another. In fact, the differences between individuals within a population are generally greater than the differences between populations.

==The concept of human races==
As a device for understanding physical variation in humans, the biological race concept has serious drawbacks:
*the category is arbitrary, which makes agreement on any given classification difficult, if not impossible. For example, if one researcher emphasizes skin color, while another emphasizes blood group differences, they will not classify people in the same way. What has happened is that human populations have grown in the course of human evolution, and with this growth have come increased opportunities for contact and gene flow between populations. Since the advent  of food production, the process has accelerated as higher birth rates and periodic food shortages have prompted the movement of farmers from their homelands to other places;
*things are complicated even more because humans are so complicated genetically;
*&quot;race&quot; exists as a cultural, as well as a biological, category. In various ways, cultures define religious, linguistic and ethnic groups as races, thereby confusing linguistic and cultural traits with physical traits;
*to make the matter even worse, this confusion of social with biological factors is frequently combined with attitudes (racism) that are then taken as excuses to exclude whole categories of people from certain roles or positions in society. In the United States, for example, the idea of race originated in the 18th century to refer to the diverse peoples - European settlers, conquered Indians, and Africans imported as slaves - that were brought together in colonial North America. This racial worldview assigned some groups to perpetual low status on the basis of their supposedly biological inferiority, while access to privilege, power and wealth was reserved for favored groups of European descent.

There has been a lot of debate not just about how many human races there may be, but about what &quot;race&quot; is and is not. Often forgotten is the fact that a race, even if it can be defined biologically, is the result of the operation of evolutionary process. Because it is these processes rather than racial categories themselves in which we are really interested, most anthropologists have abandoned the race concept as being of no particular utility. Instead, they prefer to study the distribution and significance of specific, genetically based characteristics, or else the characteristics of small breeding populations that are, after all, the smallest units in which evolutionary change occurs.

===Physical variables===
Not only have attempts to classify people into races proven counterproductive, it has also become apparent that the amount of genetic variation in humans is relatively low, compared to that of other primate species.

Nonetheless, human biological variation is a fact of life, and physical anthropologists have learned a great deal about it. Much of it is related to climatic adaptation. A correlation has been noted between body build and climate:
:Generally, people native to regions with cold climates tend to have greater body bulk (not to be equated with fat) relative to their extremities (arms and legs) than do people native to regions with hot climates, who tend to be long and slender. Interestingly, these differences show up as early as the time of Homo erectus.

Certain body builds are better suited to particular living conditions than others.
*People with larger body bulk and shorter extremities may suffer more from summer heat than someone whose extremities are long and whose body is slender. But they will conserve needed body heat under cold conditions. The reason is that a bulky body tends to conserve more heat than a less bulky one, since it has less surface relative to volume;
*People living in hot, open country, by contrast, benefit from a body build that can get rid of excess heat quickly so as to keep from overheating; for this, long extremities and a slender body, which increase surface area relative to volume, are advantageous.

Anthropologists have also studied such body features as nose, eye shape, hair textures and skin color in relation to climate.
::Ex. Subject to tremendous variation, skin color is a 	function of four factors: transparency or thickness of the skin, distribution of blood vessels, and amount of carotene and melanin in a given area of skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the amount of melanin, darkening the skin. Natural selection has favored heavily pigmented skin as protection against the strong solar radiation of equatorial latitudes. In northern latitudes, natural selection has favored relatively depigmented skins, which can utilize relatively weak solar radiation in the production of Vitamin D. Selective mating, as well as geographical location, plays a part in skin color distribution.

==Continuing human biological evolution==
In the course of their evolution, humans in all parts of the world came to rely on cultural rather than biological adaptation for their survival. Nevertheless, as they spread beyond their tropical homeland into other parts of the world, they did develop considerable physical variation from one population to another.

The forces responsible for this include:
*genetic drift, especially at the margins of their range where small populations were isolated for varying amounts of time;
*biological adaptation to differing climates.

Although much of this physical variation can still be seen in human populations today, the increasing effectiveness of cultural adaptation has often reduced its importance. Cultural practices today are affecting the human organism in important, often surprising, ways.

The probability of alterations in human biological makeup induced by culture raises a number of important questions. By trying to eliminate genetic variants, are we weakening the gene pool by allowing people with hereditary diseases and defects to reproduce? Are we reducing chances for genetic variation by trying to control population size? We are not sure of the answers to these questions.

This text was written to prepare students for the New York State Regents Earth Science exam.  As such, it closely follows the New York State Standards for Mathematics, Science, and Technology.


== Introductory Concepts ==
=== Observation and Inference ===
Observation basically means watching something and taking note of anything it does. For instance, you might observe a bird flying by watching it closely. To infer is to draw a conclusion based on what one already knows and on that alone. Suppose you see rain on your window - you can infer from that, quite trivially, that the sky is grey.

=== Density ===
The concept of density is fundamental to understanding many aspects of Earth Science.  Density is a derived unit.  That is, the density of a substance must be calculated (or derived) from other measurements.  Density is calculated by using the mass (grams) and volume (mL or cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of a given sample. Mass is determined by using a balance and volume of a fluid or solid can be determined by using a graduated cylinder. In this course, the equation for density is shown on p. 1 of the Earth Science Reference Tables as:

D = m/v, in which D represents density; m represents mass; and v represents volume.
Some of the other sciences and engineering disciplines make use of a slightly different form of the equation for density.  Solutions to problems that require the use of the density equation should include the corresponding metric system (or SI)units.

Density is considered an intrinsic property.  That is, the density of a material at a specific temperature and pressure remains the same regardless of the size of the sample being considered.  Density may be useful in helping to identify specific materials such as minerals, or in helping interpret or predict the behaviors of materials as they interact with other materials, or are subjected to changes in temperature or pressure.

=== Percent Error ===

The concept of &quot;percent error&quot; is also known as &quot;percent deviation from an accepted value&quot;, and the second term may be more helpful in understanding what is actually being determined in the equation used to calculate it.  All equations that are given in the Earth Science Reference Tables are on page 1.

The equation is (|(Accepted Value-Measured Value)|/(Accepted Value))*100, sometimes written as:

|(Difference from Accepted Value)|/(Accepted Value)*100, or simply:  (Difference from Accepted Value)/(Accepted Value)*100.

Because one has already multiplied by 100, the equation will yield a percentage value, so the appropriate unit of % should be shown in your calculated value.  One could report the value as positive or negative, and this would give information about whether your measurement is &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;, but usually the absolute value of the percent deviation is reported (the difference is converted to a positive number).

The concept of percent error or percent deviation relates to a measure used by some people in statistics in which you determine how close a value that is measured (or that is calculated from measurements) is to a value that is given as &quot;known&quot; or &quot;accepted&quot;.  Thus the term &quot;error&quot; sometimes leads to a sense of panic that something was done wrong if the percent deviation from the accepted value is high.  It is possible to have very high percent deviations if the accepted value is a small number, even if your measured value is close to the accepted.  It is also possible that the particular thing one is measuring (say the mass for a mineral sample) may have a density that is slightly different from what is &quot;accepted&quot; because it contains some &quot;impurities&quot; (variations in the elemental composition).  If one calculates a high value for a percent deviation from an accepted value, just make sure that the calculation has been done correctly, but never change the values measured to lower this percentage as these are based on actual observations!

=== Sample Questions ===
==== Multiple Choice ====
Which of these represents the density of a metal block whose mass is 200 g and volume 150 cubic centimeters?

(A)  3 000 grams per cubic centimeter.
(B)  50 grams per cubic centimeter.
(C)  350 grams per cubic centimeter.
(D)  1.3 grams per cubic centimeter.

==== Constructed Response ====
(D)  1.3 grams per cubic centimeter

== Earth's Dimensions ==
=== Shape of the Earth ===
The Earth is an oblate spheroid.  It bulges at the equator and is flattened at the poles.

Evidence of its spherical shape comes from photographs of the Earth from space, seeing the shadow of Earth during a lunar eclipse, and the fact that ships seem to sink as they move farther into sea.  Also, the altitude of the star Polaris increases with latitude.

Evidence for the fact that it is oblate comes from photographs of the Earth from space and variations in gravity along the Earth's surface (stronger at the poles where flattened, weaker at the equator where bulging, also, gravity does not pull directly down).  Also, the altitude of Polaris does not vary uniformly when increasing latitude.

The best model for the earth is a globe or a ball because Yunis says so though the Earth is oblate, it is only slightly so. On Regents exams, very often there is a question about the shape of the Earth and the answer is a ping pong ball because it is smooth and round.

=== Sample Questions ===

== Rocks and Minerals ==
=== Minerals ===
Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic, crystalline solids.

Inorganic substances are those not formed by living things, and in the majority of cases, this is true of all minerals, though there are some notable exceptions.  Inorganic molecules usually do not contain carbon as a component in their atomic structures, though again, there are some inorganic minerals that are exceptions to this general statement.

A substance is said to be crystalline if it has a regular, repeating atomic structure.  Each mineral has a specific atomic structure and formula, such as is given on page 16 of the Earth Science Reference Tables.  The individual molecule made by these atoms forms the most basic structure of that type of mineral, and then typically combines chemically with others of the same kind so that the mineral becomes larger.  Mineral samples may be microscopic or extremely large, but all the crystals of a single type of mineral share common chemical and physical properties because they share the same chemical composition, types of chemical bonds, and positions of the individual atoms within each of the mineral's molecules.  This fact, that a single mineral, whether large or small reacts similarly to chemical and physical tests is very useful in identification.

Minerals are solids.  There is actually a group of substances known as crystalline liquids, but those do not fit into the definition needed for this course.

==== Difference Between Rocks and Minerals ====
Rocks - Any natural formed aggregate or mass of mineral matter constituting an essential and appreciable part of the Earth's crust (AGI).

Mineral - A naturally formed chemical element or compound having a definite range in chemical composition, and usually a characteristic crystal form (AGI).

==== Properties of Minerals ====
===== Hardness =====

The hardness of a mineral is measured in several relative scales that are determined by how readily one mineral scratches the surface of another. The Mohs scale of hardness has ten level. #1 Talc, #2 gypsum, #3 calcite...... up to #10 DIAMOND the hardest natural substance because of the internal arrangement of its carbon atoms and the atomic bond forces in its tetrahedral shape.

===== Streak =====

The streak of a mineral refers to the color of the powder left behind when the mineral is scratched across a very hard surface, usually an unglazed porcelain plate. Most streak plates are white, though a few may be dark colored. Since a streak plate has a hardness of about 7 on Moh's scale of hardness, minerals that scratch a streak plate will obviously leave no powder behind (other than that of the streak plate itself). Typically, we group minerals by the colors of the streaks they produce. Oddly, many metallic minerals that appear shiny when viewed in a larger sample leave a dark or colored line on a streak plate. Since very small quantities of an element may cause a mineral to take on different colors, but streak tends to stay more or less consistent, we sometimes say that the color of the powdered mineral, or streak, is a more accurate test for a mineral's identity than using the color alone.

===== Color =====

The color of a mineral is generally easily influenced by a number of factors such as very small quantities of impurities in the mineral's atomic structure. Weathering of a mineral's surface may also influence how the color appears, so color is generally not as reliable a way to identify a specific mineral as is using tests such as hardness, the way a mineral breaks, or even the streak (the color of the powdered mineral).

There are also many other optical properties besides color that minerals may posses that may be unique to particular minerals, or groups of minerals.

===== Cleavage and Fracture =====

The way a mineral breaks is controlled mostly by the internal arrangement of its molecules.  Though all minerals are considered crystalline and therefore have a repeating pattern of atoms in their structures, sometimes the chemical bonds in these patterns allow a mineral to break along smooth planes.  Other times an uneven surface is produced.  Since the way a mineral breaks is an expression of the molecular pattern, we can use this visible feature to infer properties about the internal structure of the mineral.  Further, how a mineral breaks is a characteristic identifying feature of specific minerals.  Breaking minerals may produce surprising results since some minerals may produce smooth crystal shapes as they form, yet break unevenly.

When a mineral breaks along smooth planes it possesses the property called cleavage.  Minerals may break along one direction of cleavage or several.  When there is more than one direction of cleavage, we are also interested in knowing the angles created between different cleavage directions.  A single cleavage direction is inferred to extend throughout the entire sample, so it is important to not confuse parallel sides of the same cleavage plane that occur on different sides of a mineral sample.  An example would be a mineral such as halite, that breaks with 3 directions of cleavage each at a 90 degree angle to each other.  This pattern of breaking will produce a mineral sample shape that tends to be cubic, but any two opposite sides of the cubic shape are actually in the same plane, so the six sides of the broken sample result from three directions of cleavage.  It is fun to slowly break a mineral using a tool such as a bench vise and watch the cleavage planes develop as the stress is applied to the sample, though you should wear appropriate safety equipment because sometimes little chips of the sample tend to fly off unpredictably!

When a mineral breaks unevenly, and does not break along smooth planes, it is said to break with fracture.  Sometimes the type of fracture is itself characteristic, such as with the mineral quartz.  Quartz has what is known as conchoidal fracture.  Its fractured surfaces look somewhat like broken glass (most glass is made from quartz), and the name conchoidal comes from the word &quot;conch&quot; (like the sea shell) because this type of fracture makes a shell-like depression in the mineral as it breaks.

Knowing how specific minerals break and whether they have a certain type of fracture or if they have one or several directions of cleavage is one of the ways to help identify minerals or predict the behaviors a certain mineral may exhibit if it were to break.  Useful information on minerals related to cleavage and fracture is found on page 16 of the Earth Science Reference Tables.

===== Luster =====

Luster refers to the way that light reflects off the surface of a mineral sample, particularly a freshly broken or unweathered surface of the sample. The two major divisions in the classification we make are whether minerals have metallic or non-metallic luster. On page 16 of the Earth Science Reference Tables, the only common mineral listed that may have either metallic or non-metallic luster is hematite. Like all physical properties of minerals, the luster of a mineral is due to the particular aspects of its chemical composition and its atomic bonds.

=== Rocks ===
==== Sedimentary ====

Break down (erosion) of rock will yield smaller sized particles (sediments). As sediments are moved from one place to another by a transporting medium (either by wind or water) they are deposited in basins (loactions where deposition occurs).
If a cementing material is introduced to these sediments then lithification (formation of rock) will result and the outcome will be a Sedimentary rock.

Among the common cementing material is calcium carbonate and silica.

Sedimentary rock = Erosion of rock + transport of sediments + lithification.

Size of particles of a sedimentary rock indicate the environment of deposition. Coarse grained particle sizes indicate a terrestrial (land) to shallow marine environment. The smaller the particle size indicates the more we move towards the deeper sea environment.

Common sedimentary rocks are sandstone, limestone, shale and siltstone.

==== Igneous ====
Igneous rocks are formed when molten rock (magma) cools and solidifies, with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from either the Earth's mantle or pre-existing rocks made molten by extreme temperature and pressure changes. Over 700 types of igneous rocks have been described, most of them formed beneath the surface of the Earth's crust. The word &quot;igneous&quot; is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning &quot;fire&quot;.

Magma origination
The Earth's crust is about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7-10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of crystalline basement; stable igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granulite, granite and various other intrusive rocks. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt, gabbro and peridotite.

The crust floats on the asthenospheric mantle, which is convecting due to the forces of plate tectonics. The mantle, which extends to a depth of nearly 3,000 kilometers is the source of all magma. Most of the magma which forms igneous rocks is generated within the upper parts of the mantle at temperatures estimated between 600 to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C.

Melting of rocks requires temperature, water and pressure. The mantle is generally over 1000 to 1200 °c beneath the crust, at depths of between 7 and 70km. However, most magma is generated at depths of between 20 and 50 km. Melting begins because of upwelling of hot mantle from deeper portions of the earth, nearer the Planetary core; because of water driven off subducted oceanic crust at subduction zones (providing water to lower the melting point of the rocks) and because of decompression caused by rifting.

Melting of the continental crust occurs rarely because it is usually dry, and composed of minerals and rocks which are resistant to melting such as pyroxene granulite. However, addition of heat from the mantle or from mantle plumes, subduction related compression and burial as well as some rifting, can prompt the continental crust to melt.

As magma cools, minerals crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). There are relatively few minerals which are important in the formation of igneous rocks. This is because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminum, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements which combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks.

Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealized sequence of fractional crystallization of a magma.

Igneous rocks make up approximately ninety five percent of the upper part of the Earth's crust, but their great abundance is hidden on the Earth's surface by a relatively thin but widespread layer of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.

Igneous rock are geologically important because:

their minerals and global chemistry gives information about the composition of the mantle, from where some igneous rocks are extracted, and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction, and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted; 
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata, allowing a time sequence of events; 
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment, allowing tectonic reconstitution (see plate tectonics); 
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example, tungsten, tin, and uranium, are commonly associated with granites. 

Morphology and setting
In terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic) or extrusive (volcanic).


Intrusive igneous rocks
Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the earth. Surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock), the magma cools slowly, and as a result these rocks are coarse grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. The extrusive types usually are called lavas.

The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the surface.

Coarse grained intrusive igneous rocks which form at depth within the earth are termed as abyssal; intrusive igneous rocks which form near the surface are termed hypabyssal.


Extrusive igneous rocks
Extrusive igneous rocks are formed at the Earth's surface as a result of the melting of rocks within the mantle.

The melted rock, called magma rises due to contrasting density with the surrounding mantle. When it reaches the surface, magma extruded onto the surface either beneath water or air, is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes under the air are termed sub-aerial whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.

Magma which erupts from a volcano behaves according to its temperature and composition, which cause a highly different range of viscosity. High temperature magma, which is usually basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. This forms pahoehoe type lava. Intermediate composition magma such as andesite tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma such as rhyolite is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. These volcanoes rarely form lava flows, and usually erupt explosively.

Felsic and intermediate rocks which erupt at surface often do so violently, with explosions driven by release of gases such as carbon dioxide trapped in the magma. Such volcanic deposits are called pyroclastic deposits, and include tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits which can often cover vast areas.

Because lava cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is fine grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals the resulting rock may be a glass (such as the rock obsidian).

Because of this fine grained texture it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.


Classification
Igneous rock are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.

The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends upon the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential (called accessory minerals).

In a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present.

Igneous rocks which have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.

The crystals embedded in fine grained igneous rocks are termed porphyritic. The porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma consolidates into the finer grained uniform material.


Texture

Texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.

However, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or which are airfall tuffs which may be formed from volcanic ash.

Textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks tend also to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic apophyses. Mineralogical classification is used most often to classify plutonic rocks and chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, eg; &quot;olivine-bearing picrite&quot; or &quot;orthoclase-phyric rhyolite&quot;.

Chemical classification
Igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters:

Chemical - Total alkali - silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:

acid igneous rocks containing a high silica content, greater than 63% SiO2 (examples rhyolite and dacite) 
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 - 63% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (example andesite) 
basic igneous rocks have low silica 45 - 52% and typically high iron - magnesium content (example basalt) 
ultrabasic igneous rocks with less than 45% silica. (examples picrite and komatiite) 
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 - 15% alkali (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) content (examples phonolite and trachyte) 
Note: the acid-basic terminology is used more broadly in older geological literature. 
Chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks which are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance;


Ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &gt;3

Peralkaline; rocks containing molar K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/ Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;1 
Peraluminous; rocks containing molar K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/ Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;1 

Mineralogical classification
For volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criteria is the phenocryst species, followed by the ground mass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.

Mineralogical contents - felsic versus mafic

felsic rock, with predominance of quartz, alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g., granite) are usually light colored, and have low density. 
mafic rock, with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes, olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example, basalt) are usually dark colored, and have higher density than felsic rocks. 
ultramafic rock, with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g., dunite) 
For intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks where all minerals are visible at least via microscope, the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.

Example of classification
Granite is an igneous, intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and with more than 10% of felsic minerals) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible for the unaided eye and some of them retain original crystallographic shapes). Granite is the most abundant intrusive rock that can be found in the continents.

Etymology
Volcanic rocks are named after Vulcan, the Roman name for the god of fire.
Intrusive rocks are also called plutonic rocks, named after Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

'''Metamorphic Rock''' is new rock that forms when existing rocks are changed by heat, pressure, or chemicals. Heat and pressure deep underground bake and squeeze sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The minerals within the rocks change, often becoming harder. In this way they form new rocks called metamorphic rocks. After millions of years, the top layers of rocks closest to the earth's surface are worn away by weather, shifts in the earth's crust, oceans, and rivers and metamorphic rock can appear on the surface.

=== Plate Tectonics ===
Plate tectonics (from the Greek word for &quot;one who constructs and destroys&quot;, τεκτων, tekton) is a theory of geology developed to explain the phenomenon of continental drift and is currently the theory accepted by the vast majority of scientists working in this area. In the theory of plate tectonics the outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers: the lithosphere comprising (1) the crust, which has an elemental composition of: oxygen, 46.6%; silicon, 27.7%; aluminum, 8.1%; and iron, 5.0%; and (2) the solidified uppermost part of the mantle. Below the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere which comprises the inner viscous part of the mantle. The mantle makes up 84% of the earth's volume and can sometimes get as hot as 3700&amp;nbsp;°C. Over millions of years the mantle behaves like a superheated and extremely viscous liquid, but in response to sudden forces, such as earthquakes, it behaves like a rigid solid and can 'ring like a bell'.

The lithosphere essentially &quot;floats&quot; on the asthenosphere. The lithosphere is broken up into what are called tectonic plates. The ten major plates are: African, Antarctic, Australian, Eurasian, North American, South American, Pacific, Cocos, Nazca, and the Indian plates. These plates (and the more numerous minor plates) move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries (most notably around the Pacific Ring of Fire).

Plate tectonic theory arose out of two separate geological observations: continental drift, noticed in the early 20th century, and seafloor spreading, noticed in the 1960s. The theory itself was developed during the late 1960s and has since almost universally been accepted by scientists and has revolutionized the earth sciences (akin in its unifying and explanatory power for diverse geological phenomena as the development of the periodic table was for chemistry, the discovery of the genetic code for biology, and quantum mechanics in physics).

The division of the Earth's interior into lithospheric and asthenospheric components is based on their mechanical differences. The lithosphere is cooler and more rigid, whilst the asthenosphere is hotter and mechanically weaker. This division should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of the Earth into (from innermost to outermost) core, mantle, and crust. The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which float on the fluid-like (visco-elastic liquid) asthenosphere. The relative fluidity of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to undergo motion in different directions.

One plate meets another along a plate boundary, and plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features like mountains, volcanoes and oceanic trenches. The majority of the world's active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the Pacific Plate's Ring of Fire being most active and famous. These boundaries are discussed in further detail below.

Tectonic plates can include continental crust or oceanic crust, and typically, a single plate carries both. For example, the African Plate includes the continent and parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The part of the tectonic plate which is common in all cases is the uppermost solid layer of the upper mantle which lays beneath both continental and oceanic crust and is considered, together with the crust, lithosphere.

The distinction between continental crust and oceanic crust is based on the density of constituent materials; oceanic crust is denser than continental crust owing to their different proportions of various elements, particularly, silicon. Oceanic crust has less silicon and more heavier elements (&quot;mafic&quot;) than continental crust (&quot;felsic&quot;).

As a result, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level (for example most of the Pacific Plate), while the continental crust projects above sea level.

There are three types of plate boundaries, characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other. They are associated with different types of surface phenomena. The different types of plate boundaries are:

1. Transform boundaries occur where plates slide, or perhaps more accurately grind, past each other along transform faults. The relative motion of the two plates is either sinistral (left side toward the observer) or dextral (right side toward the observer). 
2. Divergent boundaries occur where two plates slide apart from each other. 
3. Convergent boundaries (or active margins) occur where two plates slide towards each other commonly forming either a subduction zone (if one plate moves underneath the other) or an orogenic belt (if the two simply collide and compress). 
Plate boundary zones occur in more complex situations where three or more plates meet and exhibit a mixture of the above three boundary types.

Transform (conservative) boundaries

The left- or right-lateral motion of one plate against another along transform faults can cause highly visible surface effects. Because of friction, the plates cannot simply glide past each other. Rather, stress builds up in both plates and when it reaches a level that exceeds the slipping-point of rocks on either side of the transform-faults the accumulated potential energy is released as strain, or motion along the fault. The massive amounts of energy that are released are the cause of earthquakes, a common phenomenon along transform boundaries.

A good example of this type of plate boundary is the San Andreas Fault complex, which is found in the western coast of North America and is one part of a highly complex system of faults in this area. At this location, the Pacific and North American plates move relative to each other such that the Pacific plate is moving northwest with respect to North America. In 50 million years or so, the part of California that is west of the San Andreas Fault will be a separate island near the Alaska area.

It should be noted that the actual direction of movement of the plates which abut at a transform like the San Andreas Fault is often not the same as their relative motion at the fault. For instance, the North American Plate as measured by GPS is actually moving southwestward, nearly perpendicular to the Pacific Plate while the Pacific Plate is actually moving slightly more westward than its relative northwest motion along the San Andreas Fault. [1] The resultant compressive forces are taken up by thrust faulting in the larger fault zone, producing California's Coast Range. The conspicuous bend in these ranges (the Transverse Ranges) and the San Andreas Fault itself in Southern California is a possible result of crustal spreading in the Great Basin region superimposed on the overall movement of the North American Plate. There is speculation by some geologists that rifting may be developing in the Great Basin as the crust here is measurably thinning.


Divergent (constructive) boundaries

At divergent boundaries, two plates move apart from each other and the space that this creates is filled with new crustal material sourced from molten magma that forms below. The origin of new divergent boundaries at triple junctions is sometimes thought to be associated with the phenomenon known as hotspots. Here, exceedingly large convective cells bring very large quantities of hot asthenospheric material near the surface and the kinetic energy is thought to be sufficient to break apart the lithosphere. The hot spot which may have initiated the Mid-Atlantic Ridge system currently underlies Iceland which is widening at a rate of a few centimeters per century.

Divergent boundaries are typified in the oceanic lithosphere by the rifts of the oceanic ridge system, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise, and in the continental lithosphere by rift valleys such as the famous East African Great Rift Valley. Divergent boundaries can create massive fault zones in the oceanic ridge system. Spreading is generally not uniform, so where spreading rates of adjacent ridge blocks are different massive transform faults occur. These are the fracture zones, many bearing names, that are a major source of submarine earthquakes. A sea floor map will show a rather strange pattern of blocky structures that are separated by linear features perpendicular to the ridge axis. If one views the sea floor between the fracture zones as conveyor belts carrying the ridge on each side of the rift away from the spreading center the action becomes clear. Crest depths of the old ridges, parallel to the current spreading center, will be older and deeper (due to thermal contraction and subsidence).

It is at mid-ocean ridges that one of the key pieces of evidence forcing acceptance of the sea-floor spreading hypothesis was found. Airborne geomagnetic surveys showed a strange pattern of symmetrical magnetic reversals on opposite sides of ridge centers. The pattern was far too regular to be coincidental as the widths of the opposing bands were too closely matched. Scientists had been studying polar reversals and the link was made. The magnetic banding directly corresponds with the Earth's polar reversals. This was confirmed by measuring the ages of the rocks within each band. The banding furnishes a map in time and space of both spreading rate and polar reversals.

There is at least one plate that has no creative ridge associated with it: the Caribbean Plate. The Caribbean Plate is generally believed to have originated at a now extinct ridge in the Pacific Ocean, yet it remains in motion according to GPS measurements. The complex tectonics of this region are the subject of ongoing research.

Convergent (destructive) boundaries
 
The nature of a convergent boundary depends on the type of lithosphere in the plates that are colliding. Where a dense oceanic plate collides with a less-dense continental plate, the oceanic plate is typically thrust underneath, forming a subduction zone. At the surface, the topographic expression is commonly an oceanic trench on the ocean side and a mountain range on the continental side. An example of a continental-oceanic subduction zone is the area along the western coast of South America where the oceanic Nazca Plate is being subducted beneath the continental South American Plate. As the subducting plate descends, its temperature rises driving off volatiles (most importantly water). As this water rises into the mantle of the overriding plate, it lowers its melting temperature, resulting in the formation of magma with large amounts of dissolved gases. This can erupt to the surface, forming long chains of volcanoes inland from the continental shelf and parallel to it. The continental spine of South America is dense with this type of volcano. In North America the Cascade mountain range, extending north from California's Sierra Nevada, is also of this type. Such volcanoes are characterized by alternating periods of quiet and episodic eruptions that start with explosive gas expulsion with fine particles of glassy volcanic ash and spongy cinders, followed by a rebuilding phase with hot magma. The entire Pacific ocean boundary is surrounded by long stretches of volcanoes and is known collectively as The Ring of Fire.

Where two continental plates collide the plates either crumple and compress or one plate burrows under or (potentially) overrides the other. Either action will create extensive mountain ranges. The most dramatic effect seen is where the northern margin of the Indian Plate is being thrust under a portion of the Eurasian plate, lifting it and creating the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau beyond. It has also caused parts of the Asian continent to deform westward and eastward on either side of the collision.

When two plates with oceanic crust converge they typically create an island arc as one plate is subducted below the other. The arc is formed from volcanics which erupt through the overriding plate as the descending plate melts below it. The arc shape occurs because of the spherical surface of the earth (nick the peel of an orange with a knife and note the arc formed by the straight-edge of the knife). A deep undersea trench is located in front of such arcs where the descending slab dips downward. Good examples of this type of plate convergence would be Japan and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.

As noted above, the plates are able to move because of the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the source of energy driving plate tectonics. Three-dimensional imaging of the Earth's interior (seismic tomography), indicates that convection of some sort is occurring throughout the mantleTanimoto 2000. How this convection relates to the motion of the plates is a matter of ongoing study and discussion. Somehow, this energy must be translated to the lithosphere in order for tectonic plates to move. There are essentially two forces that could be accomplishing this: friction and gravity.

Friction
Mantle drag  
Convection currents in the mantle are transmitted through the asthenosphere; motion is driven by friction between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere. 
Trench suction  
Local convection currents exert a downward frictional pull on plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches. 

Gravity
Ridge-push  
Plate motion is driven by the higher elevation of plates at mid-ocean ridges. Essentially stuff slides downhill. The higher elevation is caused by the relatively low density of hot material upwelling in the mantle. The real motion producing force is the upwelling and the energy source that runs it. This is a misnomer as nothing is pushing and tensional features are dominant along ridges. Also, it is difficult to explain continental break-up with this. 
Slab-pull  
Plate motion is driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches. There is considerable evidence that convection is occurring in the mantle at some scale. The upwelling of material at mid-ocean ridges is almost certainly part of this convection. Some early models of plate tectonics envisioned the plates riding on top of convection cells like conveyor belts. However, most scientists working today believe that the asthenosphere is not strong enough to directly cause motion by friction. Slab pull is widely believed to be the strongest force directly operating on plates. Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well. However, it should be noted that the North American Plate, for instance, is nowhere being subducted, yet it is in motion. Likewise the African, Eurasian and Antarctic Plates. The over-all driving force for plate motion and its energy source are still debatable subjects of on-going research. 
Lunar drag  
In a study published in the January-February 2006 issue of the Geological Society of America's journal Bulletin, a team of Italian and U.S. scientists argue that a component of the westward motion of the world's tectonic plates is due to the tidal attraction of the moon. As the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon, they say, the moon's gravity ever so slightly pulls the Earth's surface layer back westward. It may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics since Venus has no moon, and Mars' moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on Mars. [2] This is not a new argument, however. It was originally raised by the &quot;father&quot; of the plate tectonic hypothesis, Alfred Wegener. It was challenged by the physicist Harold Jeffreys who calculated that the magnitude of tidal friction required would have quickly brought the earth's rotation to a halt long ago. One might also note that many plates are actually moving north and eastward, not west. 

Plate motion is measured directly with the Global positioning satellite system (GPS).

Continental drift
For more details on this topic, see Continental drift. 
Continental drift was one of many ideas about tectonics proposed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The theory has been superseded by and the concepts and data have been incorporated within plate tectonics.

By 1915 Alfred Wegener was making serious arguments for the idea with the first edition of The Origin of Continents and Oceans. In that book he noted how the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa looked as if they were once attached. Wegener wasn't the first to note this (Francis Bacon, Benjamin Franklin and Snider-Pellegrini preceded him), but he was the first to marshal significant fossil and paleo-topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation. However, his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists, who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift. Specifically they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust.

In 1947, a team of scientists led by Maurice Ewing utilizing the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s research vessel Atlantis and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not granite which was common on the continents. They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust. All these new findings raised important and intriguing questions. [3]

Beginning in the 1950s, scientists, using magnetic instruments (magnetometers) adapted from airborne devices developed during World War II to detect submarines, began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor. This finding, though unexpected, was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt -- the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor-- contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. This distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials recorded the Earth's magnetic field at the time.

As more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s, the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences, but instead revealed recognizable patterns. When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region, the ocean floor showed a zebra-like pattern. Alternating stripes of magnetically different rock were laid out in rows on either side of the mid-ocean ridge: one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity. The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping.

When the rock strata of the tips of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way implying that they were joined initially. For instance, some parts of Scotland contain rocks very similar to those found in eastern North America. Furthermore, the Caledonian Mountains of Europe and parts of the Appalachian Mountains of North America are very similar in structure and lithology.

Floating continents
The prevailing concept was that there were static shells of strata under the continents. It was early observed that although granite existed on continents, seafloor seemed to be composed of denser basalt. It was apparent that a layer of basalt underlies continental rocks.

However, based upon abnormalities in plumb line deflection by the Andes in Peru, Pierre Bouguer deduced that less-dense mountains must have a downward projection into the denser layer underneath. The concept that mountains had &quot;roots&quot; was confirmed by George B. Airy a hundred years later during study of Himalayan gravitation, and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations.

By the mid-1950s the question remained unresolved of whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating like an iceberg.

Plate tectonic theory
Significant progress was made in the 1960s, and was prompted by a number of discoveries, most notably the Mid-Atlantic ridge. The most notable was the 1962 publication of a paper by American geologist Harry Hess (Robert S. Dietz published the same idea one year earlier in Nature. However, priority belongs to Hess, since he distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article already in 1960). Hess suggested that instead of continents moving through oceanic crust (as was suggested by continental drift) that an ocean basin and its adjoining continent moved together on the same crustal unit, or plate. In the same year, Robert R. Coats of the U.S. Geological Survey described the main features of island arc subduction in the Aleutian Islands. His paper, though little-noted (and even ridiculed) at the time, has since been called &quot;seminal&quot; and &quot;prescient&quot;. In 1967, Jason Morgan proposed that the Earth's surface consists of 12 rigid plates that move relative to each other. Two months later, in 1968, Xavier Le Pichon published a complete model based on 6 major plates with their relative motions.

Explanation of magnetic striping
 
Seafloor magnetic striping.The discovery of magnetic striping and the stripes being symmetrical around the crests of the mid-ocean ridges suggested a relationship. In 1961, scientists began to theorise that mid-ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest. New magma from deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust. This process, later called seafloor spreading, operating over many millions of years has built the 50,000 km-long system of mid-ocean ridges. This hypothesis was supported by several lines of evidence:

1. at or near the crest of the ridge, the rocks are very young, and they become progressively older away from the ridge crest; 
2. the youngest rocks at the ridge crest always have present-day (normal) polarity; 
3. stripes of rock parallel to the ridge crest alternated in magnetic polarity (normal-reversed-normal, etc.), suggesting that the Earth's magnetic field has flip-flopped many times. 

By explaining both the zebra like magnetic striping and the construction of the mid-ocean ridge system, the seafloor spreading hypothesis quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate-tectonics theory. Furthermore, the oceanic crust now came to be appreciated as a natural &quot;tape recording&quot; of the history of the reversals in the Earth's magnetic field.

Subduction discovered
A profound consequence of sea floor spreading is that new crust was, and is now, being continually created along the oceanic ridges. This idea found great favor with some scientists who claimed that the shifting of the continents can be simply explained by a large increase in size of the Earth since its formation. However, this so-called &quot;Expanded earth theory&quot; hypothesis was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing geologic mechanism to produce such a huge, sudden expansion. Most geologists believe that the Earth has changed little, if at all, in size since its formation 4.6 billion years ago, raising a key question: how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the Earth?

This question particularly intrigued Harry Hess, a Princeton University geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral, and Robert S. Dietz, a scientist with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey who first coined the term seafloor spreading. Dietz and Hess were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading. If the Earth's crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges, Hess reasoned, it must be shrinking elsewhere. He suggested that new oceanic crust continuously spread away from the ridges in a conveyor belt-like motion. Many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends into the oceanic trenches -- very deep, narrow canyons along the rim of the Pacific Ocean basin. According to Hess, the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking. As old oceanic crust was consumed in the trenches, new magma rose and erupted along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins were perpetually being &quot;recycled,&quot; with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously. Thus, Hess' ideas neatly explained why the Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading, why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks.

Mapping with earthquakes
During the 20th century, improvements in seismic instrumentation and greater use of earthquake-recording instruments (seismographs) worldwide enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in certain areas, most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges. By the late 1920s, seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40-60° from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the Earth. These zones later became known as Wadati-Benioff zones, or simply Benioff zones, in honor of the seismologists who first recognized them, Kiyoo Wadati of Japan and Hugo Benioff of the United States. The study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above-ground testing of nuclear weapons. The much-improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide.

Geological paradigm shift
The acceptance of the theories of continental drift and sea floor spreading (the two key elements of plate tectonics) can be compared to the Copernican revolution in astronomy (see Nicolaus Copernicus). Within a matter of only several years geophysics and geology in particular were revolutionized. The parallel is striking: just as pre-Copernican astronomy was highly descriptive but still unable to provide explanations for the motions of celestial objects, pre-tectonic plate geological theories described what was observed but struggled to provide any fundamental mechanisms. The problem lay in the question &quot;How?&quot;. Before acceptance of plate tectonics, geology in particular was trapped in a &quot;pre-Copernican&quot; box.

However, by comparison to astronomy the geological revolution was much more sudden. What had been rejected for decades by any respectable scientific journal was eagerly accepted within a few short years in the 1960s and 1970s. Any geological description before this had been highly descriptive. All the rocks were described and assorted reasons, sometimes in excruciating detail, were given for why they were where they are. The descriptions are still valid. The reasons, however, today sound much like pre-Copernican astronomy.

One simply has to read the pre-plate descriptions of why the Alps or Himalaya exist to see the difference. In an attempt to answer &quot;how&quot; questions like &quot;How can rocks that are clearly marine in origin exist thousands of meters above sea-level in the Dolomites?&quot;, or &quot;How did the convex and concave margins of the Alpine chain form?&quot;, any true insight was hidden by complexity that boiled down to technical jargon without much fundamental insight as to the underlying mechanics.

With plate tectonics answers quickly fell into place or a path to the answer became clear. Collisions of converging plates had the force to lift sea floor into thin atmospheres. The cause of marine trenches oddly placed just off island arcs or continents and their associated volcanoes became clear when the processes of subduction at converging plates were understood.

Mysteries were no longer mysteries. Forests of complex and obtuse answers were swept away. Why were there striking parallels in the geology of parts of Africa and South America? Why did Africa and South America look strangely like two pieces that should fit to anyone having done a jigsaw puzzle? Look at some pre-tectonics explanations for complexity. For simplicity and one that explained a great deal more look at plate tectonics. A great rift, similar to the Great Rift Valley in north eastern Africa, had split apart a single continent, eventually forming the Atlantic Ocean, and the forces were still at work in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

We have inherited some of the old terminology, but the underlying concept is as radical and simple as &quot;The Earth moves&quot; was in astronomy.

'''Thunderstorms'''

Probably the most common of storms, these form when large-scale convection occurs, drawing warm, moist air up into colder parts of the troposphere.  This can happen along fronts, because of local topography such as mountains, and because of the rising of a warm air parcel over a piece of warm land.  the moisture is converted into deep cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds, the warm air of which, becomes the updraft.  As the air rises up high enough, perhaps even to the tropopause, it cools, and begins to sink, forming a downdraft.  

This huge mixing of air molecules throws both water droplets, which nucleate to a small particles such as dust or pollen, as well as electrical charges all about the cloud.  Remember that water molecules are polar, which means they have separated charges.  This means that they carry electrical particles easily.  The winds separate ice droplets and water droplets, the latter of which tends to carry a positive charge.  Negative charges in the air and along the ground align with the cloud and travel with it.  When they meet, as in a high point on a tree or cliff, an electrical discharge occurs, and lightning is born.  The super-hot zap of energy quickly heats the immediate air surrounding it, creating a loud shock wave known as thunder.

The water droplets often coelace, forming bigger and bigger drops until they are heavy enough to fall as rain.  If the droplets are carried up to the freezing point repeatedly, adding new water layers on each time until it too is heavy enough to fall, hail results.

== Astronomy ==

Astronomy is the study of all matter and energy systems that exist outside, or &quot;above&quot;, the region of the Earth's atmosphere.  It also includes the histories and possible future behaviors of this matter and these energy systems.  The Earth is derived from the matter and energy that surrounds it, and continues to be influenced by events in space.

=== Introduction to the Solar System and Planets ===
The solar system consists of the sun and anything that orbits it.

It has planets, which are spherical objects that orbit the sun and rotate on an axis.  The planets are divided into terrestrial planets, which include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars and are made of solids, and Jovian planets, which include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune and are made of gases.  Many planets have moons revolving around them.

Asteroids are mostly non-spherical objects that orbit the sun.  They are found mostly in a belt between Mars and Jupiter.

Comets are objects made of ice, dust, and gas.  They orbit the sun in a very elliptical shape.  When they are close to the sun, they melt partially, which causes them to have a 'tail'.

Meteorites are small rock like substances orbiting the sun.  When they enter Earth's atmosphere, they burn and are called meteors or shooting starts.  If they hit the Earth, they can leave impact craters.

During the Summer, it rises and sets due north of east and its apparent path is higher in the sky.

==== Seasons ====
====Earth's Revolution====
Earth's orbit causes the seasons and takes approximately 365.25 days to complete.

The orbit is maintained by the balance of gravity, or the attractive force between to substances, and inertia.  The shape of the orbit is slightly elliptical, with one of the foci being the sun.  This causes the Earth to be closest to the sun in January and farthest from the sun in July with the apparent diameter of the sun being larger in July.  It does ''not'' cause the seasons.

=== Understanding Relationships Between Variables ===
In science, we use either sentences or graphs to show how one thing affects another.  For example, we can say that the more homework you do, the higher your grade will be.

Another way to say this is...
&lt;pre&gt;
As the homework you do increases, your grade will also increase
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sentences that describe relationships often follow this format...
&lt;pre&gt;
1.  They begin with the words, &quot;As the&quot;
2.  They include the first variable (in this case, &quot;number of pieces of homework you do&quot;)
3.  The first variable is followed by the word, &quot;increase(s)&quot; or &quot;decrease(s)&quot;
4.  Then you put the second variable (in this case, &quot;your grade&quot;.
5.  The second variable is followed by the word, &quot;increase(s)&quot; or &quot;decrease(s)&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the directions above, create sentences that describe the relationships between the following...

*1.  The age and height of a child.
*2.  The time between meals and your hunger.

These relationships can also be represented as graphs.

Earth science is a lot of common sense thinking, for example if you think about it you could know it without being taught, it just makes sense. For example, if you are seeing which rock layer comes first and there is an intrusion, if you think about it the intrusion can't have come first because it had nothing to intrude so the rock layers had to lay down first

{{displaytitle|title=Modern Human Behavior: Origin of Language}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Recognition of symbol use in the archaeological record (following Philip Chase's criteria):
*Regularity of use indicating purposeful and repeated activity;
*Yet repetitive behavior alone is not enough, because by itself not indicative of symbol use: Ex. Actions of individuals working without a system of shared meaning
*Therefore patterns need to be complex and learned linguistically rather than by observation or mimicry;
*Finally such behavior becomes symbolic, if it intentionally communicates thoughts, emotions, belief systems, group identity, etc. Material expressions of culturally mediated symbols:
**intentional burial of the dead, with grave goods;
**figurative and abstract imagery;
**pigment use;
**body ornamentation.

Important effort to clarify definition and category of data we are dealing with. Yet if we follow these criteria, most artefacts from Lower (Acheulean) and Middle Paleolithic (60,000-50,000 years ago) are ruled out, because of lack of evidence for repeated patterning and intentionality.

==Contribution of evolutionary psychology to origins of art==
Is intelligence a single, general-purpose domain or a set of domains? Evolutionary psychologists answer: set of domains, which they call &quot;mental modules&quot;, &quot;multiple intelligences&quot;, &quot;cognitive domains&quot;; these &quot;mental modules&quot; interact, are connected;

Anatomically modern humans have better interaction between modules than other animals; therefore, able to perform more complex behaviors;

Four cognitive and physical processes exist:
*making visual images
*classification of images into classes
*intentional communication
*attribution of meaning to images

The first three are found in non-human primates and most hominids. Yet, only modern humans seem to have developed the fourth one.

For Neanderthals, intentional communication and classification were probably sealed in social intelligence module, while mark-making and attribution of meaning (both implicating material objects) were hidden. Only with arrival of modern humans, connection between modules made art
possible by allowing intentional communication to escape into the domain of mark-making.

===Problems with data and chronology===
We could easily look at this transition in a smooth way: The passage from one industry to the next, one hominid to the next, etc. Evolutionary paths well structured and detailed, as in textbooks, but a bit too clear-cut, that is simplistic and reductionist.

After 1.8 million years ago, when ''H. ergaster/erectus'' moved out-of-Africa, the picture of human evolution becomes much more complex.

Situation due to several reasons:
*many more hominid species appear connected to global colonization and relative isolation;
*many cultural variations observed, illustrated by various stone tool industries, subsistence patterns, etc.

Overall, presence of differentiated cultural provinces in Africa and Eurasia which have their own evolutionary pace.

Dates don't seem to reveal a clear-cut divide between the Lower and Middle Paleolithic and don't fit anymore in a specific and rigorous time frame:
*H. erectus disappeared in most places around 300,000-200,000 yrs ago, although still found in Java up to 50,000 yrs ago;
*Archaic modern humans (Neanderthals) appeared around 130,000 yrs ago in Europe;
*Archaic modern humans (H. sapiens sapiens) appeared some time between 200,000 and 100,000 yrs ago in Africa;
*Acheulean stone tools were still in use beyond 200,000 yrs ago in many areas;
*The lithic industry (Mousterian) characteristic of the Middle Paleolithic appeared around 250,000 yrs ago in some areas (SW Asia);
*Subsistence patterns (hunting/scavenging), use of fire, habitats were still the basis of cultural adaptations in the Middle Paleolithic.

By focusing on a transition happening only at 50,000 yrs ago would be overlooking some major human innovations and evolutionary trends that took place earlier and on a much longer period.

We need to focus more on ''H. heidelbergensis'' and its material culture and other behavioral patterns to realize that the transition was not at 50,000 years ago, but between 600,000 and 60,000 yrs ago.

===The revolution that wasn't===
&quot;Revolution&quot; is in this context the Upper Paleolithic Revolution, with the development from 50,000 yrs ago of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', considered the only species anatomically AND behaviorally modern.

By &quot;modern human behavior,&quot; we mean:
*Increased artifact diversity;
*Standardization of artefact types;
*Blade Technology;
*Worked bone and other organic materials;
*Personal ornaments and &quot;art&quot; or images;
*Structured living spaces;
*Ritual;
*Economic intensification, reflected in the exploitation of aquatic or other resources that require specialized technology;
*Expanded exchange networks.

By overlooking and even not considering recent discoveries from the 1990s regarding the periods before 50,000 years ago, we are misled to consider the evidence after that date as the result of biological and cultural revolution.

Recent observations in Africa, Europe and Asia from sites between 600,000 and 250,000 years ago (Acheulean period) seem to document very different patterns: &quot;The Revolution That Wasn't&quot;.

===Evidence in the Lower Paleolithic===
====Stone tools: blade technology====
*Blade technology appeared and disappeared at different points in time. Earliest evidence to date: Kapthurin Formation (Kenya) 550,000-300,000 BP

====Bone tools====
*Swartkrans (South Africa)
*Makapansgat (South Africa)
*Drimolen (South Africa)

====Wooden tools====
*Schöningen (Germany) 400,000 years ago: Spears

====Use of pigments (ochre)====
*Kapthurin Formation (Kenya) 550,000-300,000 yrs ago
*Twin Rivers Cave (Zambia) 400,000-200,000 yrs ago
*Pomongwe (Zimbabwe) 250,000-220,000 yrs ago
*Terra Amata (France) 300,000 yrs ago
*Becov (Czech Republic) 250,000 yrs ago

====Artistic expression====
*Pech de l'Azé (France) 400,000 yrs ago: Engraved bone
*Sainte-Anne I Cave (France): Engraved bone
*Bilzingsleben (Germany) 300,000 yrs ago: Large engraved rib
*Singi Talav (India) 300,000-150,000 yrs ago: Occurrence of non-utilitarian objects (Quartz crystals)
*Zhoukoudian (China): Occurrence of non-utilitarian objects
*Birket Ram (Israel): Human figurine
*Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania): Figurine
*Makapansgat (South Africa): Human figurine
*Tan-Tan (Morocco) 500,000-300,000 yrs ago: Human figurine

====Mortuary practices====
*Atapuerca (Spain) 350,000 yrs ago: H. heidelbergensis

====Seafaring====
*Flores Island (Indonesia) 780,000 yrs ago

==Origins of language==
Sometime during the last several million years, hominids evolved the ability to communicate much more complex and detailed information (about nature, technology, and social relationships) than any other creatures.

Yet we, cannot reconstruct the evolutionary history of language as we reconstruct the history of bipedalism because the ability to use language leaves no clear traces in the fossil record. Therefore, there is no consensus among paleoanthropologists about when language evolved.

But from new information learned from DNA testing by at the Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, the very stable gene FOXP2 (this is the gene that makes speech possible) suddenly changed approximately 250,000 years ago, 2 of the molecular units in the 715-unit DNA sequence abruptly changed. Neanderthals did not have this modification in their gene sequence, whereas Homo Sapien Sapiens did have this modification and were much more articulate .

We are going to try to clarify the current situation by reviewing the recent evidence on the topic, focusing on specific criteria that could reveal essential information on early forms of language:
*brain capacity
*brain asymmetry
*vocal apparatus

===The intellectual and linguistic skills of early hominids===
====Australopithecines====
Reconstruction work on australopithecines indicates that their vocal tract was basically like that of apes, with the larynx and pharynx high up in the throat. This would not have allowed for the precise manipulation of air that is required for modern human languages. The early hominids could make sounds, but they would have been more like those of chimpanzees.

====H. ergaster/erectus====
=====Brain capacity=====
Their average cranial capacity was just a little short of the modern human minimum, and some individual erectus remains fall within the human modern range. It is difficult to be certain what this fact means in terms of intelligence.

=====Brain asymmetry=====
Paleoanthropologist Ralph Holloway has looked at the structure of ''H. erectus'' brains. He made endocasts of the inside surfaces of fossil crania, because the inside of the skull reflects some of the features of the brain it once held.

One intriguing find is that the brains of ''H. erectus'' were asymmetrical: the right and left halves of the brain did not have the same shape. This is found to a greater extent in modern humans, because the two halves of the human brain perform different functions. Language and the ability to use symbols, for example, are functions of the left hemisphere, while spatial reasoning (like the hand-eye coordination needed to make complex tools) is performed by the right hemisphere. This hints that ''H. erectus'' also had hemisphere specialization, perhaps even including the ability to communicate through a symbolic language.

=====Vocal apparatus=====
Further evidence of language use by ''H. erectus'' is suggested by the reconstruction of the vocal apparatus based on the anatomy of the cranial base. Even though the vocal apparatus is made up of soft parts, those parts are connected to bone; so the shape of the bone is correlated with the shape of the larynx, pharynx and other features. ''H. erectus'' had vocal tracts more like those of modern humans, positioned lower in the throat and allowing for a greater range and speed of sound production. Thus, erectus could have produced vocal communication that involved many sounds with precise differences.

Whether or not they did so is another question. But given their ability to manufacture fairly complex tools and to survive in different and changing environmental circumstances, ''H. ergaster/erectus'' certainly could have had complex things to &quot;talk about&quot;. Therefore it is not out of question that erectus had a communication system that was itself complex, even though some scholars are against this idea.

==Summary==
Scientists struggle with the definition of human behavior, while dealing with evidence dating to the early part of the Lower Paleolithic (7-2 million years ago).

Definition of modern human behavior is not easier to draw. The answer to this topic should not be found only in the period starting at around 50,000 yrs ago. Evidence now shows that the period between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago was rich in attempts at elaborating new behavioral patterns, either material or more symbolic.

On another level, beginning about 1.6 million years ago, brain size began to increase over and beyond that which can be explained by an increase in body size. Some researchers point to evidence that suggests that from 1.6 million years to about 300,000 years ago, the brain not only dramatically increased in size but also was being neurally reorganized in a way that increased its ability to process information in abstract (symbolic) way. This symbolism allowed complex information to be stored, relationships to be derived, and information to be efficiently retrieved and communicated to others in various ways.

;Before 200,000 yrs ago, what is the relationship between  ''H. erectus'' and ''H. heidelbergensis''?

''H. heidelbergensis'' seems to be the author of these new behavioral patterns, not ''H. erectus''. ''H. heidelbergensis'', especially in Africa, shows therefore evidence of new stone tool technology (blades), grinding stone and pigment (ochre) processing before 200,000 years ago. These new patterns connected with ''H. heidelbergensis'' could therefore be seen as critical advantages over ''H. erectus'' in the human evolutionary lineage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''us (Homo sapiens) and the others (other hominid species, e.g. Neandertals, Homo erectus)'' -- This may be inaccurate. There has been a lot of movement in the anthropological literature in the past 15 years, and I believe the Neandertals are no longer considered a separate species. We are the subspecies ''Homo sapiens sapiens''; they are the subspecies ''Homo sapiens neanderthalensis''. ([http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html Talk.Origins FAQ on Hominid Species] -- Only mentions this in passing, but may be a good place to start looking for a definitive answer.)--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 04:41, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Update: A bit of reading at talk.origins, and it looks like the Neandertals were considered the same species, but now there's talk of separating them out again. So this might not be inaccurate. Or it might be. Or it might not be now, but might be next year. I'd recommend deleting it just to be safe, and to avoid having to update it  every time the wind changes directions. This is also something to keep an eye on when discussing Neandertals in later chapters.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 04:14, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

''states/civilizations developed and remained within their own ecological boundaries... This situation shifted 500 years ago'' -- I think this is also a misstatement. The peoples Alexander conquered might argue the point, at any rate, as well as those subjugated by the Romans.

''totally unparalleled scope'' -- This is very vague, and again I think it's an overstatement. Perhaps its unparalleled within the field of human evolution, but I don't think even that is provable.

''There is therefore a problem to conceptualize the causes of the transformation process'' -- I'm not sure what this means. It is difficult to conceptualize the causes?

''While resource exploitation is clearly the basic cause of the destruction of tribal peoples'' -- Again, debatable. It's certainly not the only cause.

''Of course, as a culture of consumption'' -- I'm not sure what value is served by having this bold and centered. Makes it read more like an activist flyer than an objective textbook (as objective as anthropology can ever be, but that's a discussion for another time).

''Unquestionably, tribal cultures represent a clear rejection of the materialistic values of industrial civilization'' -- *blink* A sweeping generalization, and hardly unquestionable. (I'm writing in sentence fragments -- yep, must be after midnight again.) The absence of a value set is not necessarily the same as the rejection of that value set.

Finally, and most importantly, I'm not sure this chapter even belongs in a book on paleoanthropology. It could certainly belong in a book on anthropology in general, but if it's to remain here, I think it needs to be cut for extraneous material and the remainder needs additional text to place it firmly within the context of paleoanthropology. For each paragraph, we should ask &quot;Why is this relevant for a field that deals primarily with fossil hominids?&quot;--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 04:41, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:As in introduction text, the first seven chapters are devoted to getting the reader acquainted with basic concepts that are needed to understand the area. 

::So how is this chapter relevant to paleoanthropology? If we ''wanted'' to make value judgements about the past, then I could see its relevance, while disagreeing with the content, but surely science is about avoiding value judgements. If we are sticking to the facts this chapter becomes irrelevant. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

:::Actually, all science makes value judgments -- some just pretend they don't. *grin* Anthropology as a field just tries to be a bit more honest about it. Instead of saying &quot;We don't make value judgments, no way, no sir!&quot;, anthropology makes an open effort to identify the value judgments that, as cultural products ourselves, we can't help making, so that once they are identified, we can take a step back from them and try to minimize their effects.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 18:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC) 

::::True, we can't always avoid value judgements, though we should attempt to. When we can't, it is indeed necessary to say what they are, which this draft doesn't. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 

:::Picture it as a closed glass window. If, as in many sciences, you're paying attention to what's beyond the window and not to the glass itself, you may think that your vision is clear. But anthropologists take the time to look at the glass first, how thick it is, how smudged or streaked is, and do their best to first clean it and then factor the uncleanable distortions out of their interpretations of what they see beyond the window. But you can't factor the distortions out if you don't first recognize them for what they are, which is why ethnocentrism is very much relevant for this book. (Which is not to say all the text in this chapter is relevant, or that this is the best presentation for ethnocentrism, but as a first draft it's not supposed to be).--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 18:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::However, the anthopologists (not paleoanthropologists) are all wearing their own pairs of glasses, so they see the window itself differently. Which one has the best glasses is hotly debated.

::I think seven chapters might be a bit too much, although I don't object to the idea of surveying relevant concepts from other subdisciplines. But the keyword there is relevant, and I think much of this chapter isn't relevant (the history of progressivism details, for instance). And again, I think it needs work to show why it's relevant. Considering this is just a first draft, though, I'm happy to leave most of the &quot;why it's relevant&quot; text for the next pass.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 18:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::The problem is that the justification of relevancy seems likely to touch on political issues, which would make neutrality, and consensus, challenging.[[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

:Since sustainable culture is one of the defining characterists of humanity, it is essential in this introductory text for us to put things into context and to address possible misconceptions in mindset of the reader.

::Defining? Since when? People might like it be defining, but that is not enough to make it so. We must not fall for the myth of the noble savage, with his/her idyllic, enviromentally sustainable, lifestyle. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

:::Culture has been one of the defining characteristics. It can perhaps be argued, when you talk about tool-using animals for instance, but that's a debate for the experts, not an introductory text. &quot;Sustainable&quot; is more easily argued, although a case can be made that if it wasn't sustainable we wouldn't still be here after thousands of years. But in any case, I think sustainability is irrelevant here, especially since any discussion of it is also based on value judgements.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 18:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::Sustainable is what I meant. In one sense, any extant species has a sustainable lifestyle, since it has sustained the species throughout its lifespan, but that's not what people normally mean. What the word should mean requires a value judgement, which can be provided by the reader. The text describes the extinction of the megafauna, and the possible role of man; the reader decides whether or not that's evidence of a sustainable culture. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

:As for the wording and format issues, they can be fixed in future edits. After 7 months of notes, I am trying to finish the rest of the chapters this weekend. [[User:Davodd|Davodd]] 05:58, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::If this chapter is to stay, it will require considerable rewriting. Taking the final three paragraphs alone:

::*'Unquestionably', is far too strong a word, and the second clause of the first sentence is semantically empty. Anything can happen given the necessary conditions, but that tells us nothing. The final sentence is not entirely false; nothing has been said to show that the values are cultural universals, but since the contrary is also unsubstantiated the tone of this sentence is inappropriate.

::*Ethnocentric views are no more automatically wrong than they are automatically right, which makes the first sentence irrelevant. Almost anything could be defended as being 'reasonable', which undermines the conclusion of the second sentence. Besides, all three of these paragraphs appear meant to be rebuttal of the claim that tribal cultures ''desire'' material wealth and prosperity. Even if this paragraph showed reasonable needs were met by trbal culutures, it would do nothing to show they meet human desires, which makes the entire paragraph of marginal relevance.

:::Although I agree that this chapter needs much rewriting, I have to disagree that &quot;Ethnocentric views are no more automatically wrong than they are automatically right&quot;. That may be true generally speaking, but here we are speaking specifically for the field of anthropology.  Just as the medical field takes as a given the value judgment that &quot;healing people is good, death and disease are bad&quot;, modern anthropology takes as a given that &quot;ethnocentric views are bad&quot;, and a student of anthropology will be expected to understand this.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 18:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::::''Holding'' ethnocentric views is bad, but to argue that a view is wrong merely ''because'' it is ethnocentric is to argue ad hominem, a logical fallacy. Saying 'Many adult humans drink cows' milk' simply because they do so in England would be ethnocentric, but ''the conclusion would be true nonetheless''.  Thus, the truth of a statement has to be evaluated independantly of its ethnocentricity, or you're not doing science.[[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 21:23, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::This isn't just an ethical standpoint--it's a practical one. Ethnocentrism interferes with the practice of anthropology. If I look at a bone with 28 hash marks on it, before I assume that it's a lunar calendar, I need to recognize that I'm also assuming whoever made the hash marks gave a flip about lunar cycles, also valued numbers, and valued making records. Any or all of those ethnocentric assumptions may be wrong, and I can't properly evaluate that bone if I don't recognize that I'm looking at it through the eyes of someone with a lunar calendar on her own wall.--[[User:Bedawyn|Bedawyn]] 18:17, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::*'Abundant evidence' is highly questionable, as is any claim to measure 'real costs'. Any account of this will inevitably be politically sensitive; consensus on these issues most unlikely.

::On the whole, it would be much simpler to stick to the objective facts. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 09:56, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

==The second phase of human migration==
The time period between 250,000 and 50,000 years ago is commonly called the Middle Paleolithic.

At the same time that Neanderthals occupied Europe and Western Asia, other kinds of people lived in the Far East and Africa, and those in Africa were significantly more modern than the Neanderthals.

These Africans are thus more plausible ancestors for living humans, and it appears increasingly likely that Neanderthals were an evolutionary dead end, contributing few if any genes to historic populations.

Topics to be covered in this chapter:
* Summary of the fossil evidence for both the Neanderthals and some of their contemporaries;
* Second phase of human migration (&quot;Out-of-Africa 2&quot; Debate)

==Neanderthals==


&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;

===History of Research===
In 1856, a strange skeleton was discovered in Feldhofer Cave in the Neander Valley (&quot;thal&quot; = valley) near Dusseldorf, Germany. The skull cap was as large as that of a present-day human but very different in shape. Initially this skeleton was interpreted as that of a congenital idiot.

The Forbes Quarry (Gibraltar) female cranium (now also considered as Neanderthal) was discovered in 1848, eight years before the Feldhofer find, but its distinctive features were not recognized at that time.

Subsequently, numerous Neanderthal remains were found in Belgium, Croatia, France, Spain, Italy, Israel and Central Asia.

Anthropologists have been debating for 150 years whether Neanderthals were a distinct species or an ancestor of Homo sapiens sapiens. In 1997, DNA analysis from the Feldhofer Cave specimen showed decisively that Neanderthals were a distinct lineage.

These data imply that Neanderthals and ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' were separate lineages with a common ancestor, Homo heidelbergensis, about 600,000 years ago.

===Anatomy===
[[File:Neanderthal_and_homo_sapiens_sapiens.jpg|thumb|right|Full skeletons of modern ''Homo Sapiens'' (left) and Neanderthal (right)]]
Unlike earlier hominids (with some rare exceptions), Neanderthals are represented by many complete or nearly complete skeletons. Neanderthals provide the best hominid fossil record of the Plio-Pleistocene, with about 500 individuals. About half the skeletons were children. Typical cranial and dental features are present in the young individuals, indicating Neanderthal features were inherited, not acquired.

Morphologically the Neanderthals are a remarkably coherent group. Therefore they are easier to characterize than most earlier human types.

Neanderthal skull has a low forehead, prominent brow ridges and occipital bones. It is long and low, but relatively thin walled. The back of the skull has a characteristic rounded bulge, and does not come to a point at the back.

[[File:Sapiens_neanderthal_comparison_en.png|thumb|right|Skulls of ''Homo Sapiens'' (left) and Neanderthal (right)]]
Cranial capacity is relatively large, ranging from 1,245 to 1,740 cc and averaging about 1,520 cc. It overlaps or even exceeds average for ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. The robust face with a broad nasal region projects out from the braincase. By contrast, the face of modern Homo sapiens sapiens is tucked under the brain box, the forehead is high, the occipital region rounded, and the chin prominent.

Neanderthals have small back teeth (molars), but incisors are relatively large and show very heavy wear.

Neanderthal short legs and arms are characteristic of a body type that conserves heat. They were strong, rugged and built for cold weather. Large elbow, hip, knee joints, and robust bones suggest great muscularity. Pelvis had longer and thinner pubic bone than modern humans.

All adult skeletons exhibit some kind of disease or injury. Healed fractures and severe arthritis show that they had a hard life, and individuals rarely lived past 40 years old.

===Chronology===
Neanderthals lived from about 250,000 to 30,000 years ago in Eurasia.

The earlier ones, like at Atapuerca (Sima de Los Huesos), were more generalized. The later ones are the more specialized, &quot;classic&quot; Neanderthals.

The last Neanderthals lived in Southwest France, Portugal, Spain, Croatia, and the Caucasus as recently as 27,000 years ago.

===Geography===
[[File:Range of Neanderthals.png|thumb|right|Distribution of Neanderthals]]
The distribution of Neanderthals extended from Uzbekistan in the east to the Iberian peninsula in the west, from the margins of the Ice Age glaciers in the north to the shores of the Mediterranean sea in the south.

South-West France (Dordogne region) is among the richest in Neanderthal cave shelters:
* La Chapelle-aux-Saints;
* La Ferrassie;
* Saint-Césaire (which is one of the younger sites at 36,000).

Other sites include:
* Krapina in Croatia;
* Saccopastore in Italy;
* Shanidar in Iraq;
* Teshik-Tash (Uzbekistan). The 9-year-old hominid from  this site lies at the most easterly known part of their range.

No Neanderthal remains have been discovered in Africa or East Asia.

==Homo sapiens==
===Chronology and Geography===
The time and place of Homo sapiens origin has preoccupied anthropologists for more than a century. For the longest time, many assumed their origin was in South-West Asia. But in 1987, anthropologist Rebecca Cann and colleagues compared DNA of Africans, Asians, Caucasians, Australians, and New Guineans. Their findings were striking in two respects:
* the variability observed within each population was greatest by far in Africans, which implied the African population was oldest and thus ancestral to the Asians and Caucasians;
* there was very little variability between populations which indicated that our species originated quite recently.

The human within-species variability was only 1/25th as much as the average difference between human and chimpanzee DNA. The human and chimpanzee lineages diverged about 5 million years ago. 1/25th of 5 million is 200,000. Cann therefore concluded that Homo sapiens originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago. Much additional molecular data and hominid remains further support a recent African origin of Homo sapiens, now estimated to be around 160,000-150,000 years ago.

===Earliest Evidence===

The Dmanisi evidence suggests early Europeans developed in Asia and migrated to Europe creating modern Europeans with minor interaction with African Homo types. July 5 2002 issue of the journal Science and is the subject of the cover story of the August issue of National Geographic magazine.
New Asian finds are significant, they say, especially the 1.75 million-year-old small-brained early-human fossils found in Dmanisi, Georgia, and the 18,000-year-old &quot;hobbit&quot; fossils (Homo floresiensis) discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia.

Such finds suggest that Asia's earliest human ancestors may be older by hundreds of thousands of years than previously believed, the scientists say. 
Robin Dennell, of the University of Sheffield in England, and Wil Roebroeks, of Leiden University in the Netherlands, describe their ideas in the December 22, 2005 issue of Nature.
The fossil and archaeological finds characteristic of early modern humans are represented at various sites in East and South Africa, which date between 160,000 and 77,000 years ago.

====Herto (Middle Awash, Ethiopia)====

In June 2003, publication of hominid remains of a new subspecies: ''Homo sapiens idaltu''. Three skulls (two adults, one juvenile) are interpreted as the earliest near-modern humans: 160,000-154,000 BP. They exhibit some modern traits (very large cranium; high, round skull; flat face without browridge), but also retain archaic features (heavy browridge; widely spaced eyes). Their anatomy and antiquity link earlier archaic African forms to later fully modern ones, providing strong evidence that East Africa was the birthplace of ''Homo sapiens''.

====Omo-Kibish (Ethiopia)====

In 1967, Richard Leakey and his team uncovered a partial hominid skeleton (Omo I), which had the features of Homo sapiens. Another partial fragment of a skull (Omo II) revealed a cranial capacity over 1,400 cc. Dating of shells from the same level gave a date of 130,000 years.

====Ngaloba, Laetoli area (Tanzania)====

A nearly complete skull (LH 18) was found in Upper Ngaloba Beds. Its morphology is largely modern, yet it retains some archaic features such as prominent brow ridges and a receding forehead. Dated at about 120,000 years ago.

====Border Cave (South Africa)====

Remains of four individuals (a partial cranium, 2 lower jaws, and a tiny buried infant) were found in a layer dated to at least 90,000 years ago. Although fragmentary, these fossils appeared modern.

====Klasies River (South Africa)====

Site occupied from 120,000 to 60,000 years ago. Most human fossils come from a layer dated to around 90,000 years ago. They are fragmentary: cranial, mandibular, and postcranial pieces. They
appear modern, especially a fragmentary frontal bone that lacks a brow ridge. Chin and tooth size also have a modern aspect.

====Blombos Cave (South Africa)====

A layer dated to 77,000 BCE yielded 9 human teeth or dental fragments, representing five to seven individuals, of modern appearance.

===Anatomy===

African skulls have reduced browridges and small faces. They tend to be higher, more rounded than classic Neanderthal skulls, and some approach or equal modern skulls in basic vault shape. Where cranial capacity can be estimated, the African skulls range between 1,370 and 1,510 cc, comfortably within the range of both the Neanderthals and anatomically modern people.

Mandibles tend to have significantly shorter and flatter faces than did the Neanderthals.

Postcranial parts indicate people who were robust, particularly in their legs, but who were fully modern in form.

==Out-of-Africa 2: The debate==
Most anthropologists agree that a dramatic shift in hominid morphology occurred during the last glacial epoch. About 150,000 years ago the world was inhabited by a morphologically heterogeneous collection of hominids: Neanderthals in Europe; less robust archaic Homo sapiens in East Asia; and somewhat more modern humans in East Africa (Ethiopia) and also SW Asia. By 30,000 years ago, much of this diversity had disappeared. Anatomically modern humans occupied all of the Old World.

In order to understand how this transition occurred, we need to answer two questions:
# Did the genes that give rise to modern human morphology arise in one region, or in many different parts of the globe?
# Did the genes spread from one part of the world to another by gene flow, or through the movement and replacement of one group of people by another?

Unfortunately, genes don't fossilize, and we cannot study the genetic composition of ancient hominid populations directly. However, there is a considerable amount of evidence that we can bring to bear on these questions through the anatomical study of the fossil record and the molecular biology of living populations.
The shapes of teeth from a number of hominid species suggest that arrivals from Asia played a greater role in colonizing Europe than hominids direct from Africa, a new analysis of more than 5,000 ancient teeth suggests. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Aug 2007)

Two opposing hypotheses for the transition to modern humans have been promulgated over the last decades:
* the &quot;multi-regional model&quot; sees the process as a localized speciation event;
* the &quot;out-of-Africa model&quot; sees the process as the result of widespread phyletic transformation.

===The &quot;Multi-regional&quot; model===
This model proposes that ancestral Homo erectus populations throughout the world gradually and independently evolved first through archaic Homo sapiens, then to fully modern humans. In this case, the Neanderthals are seen as European versions of archaic sapiens.

Recent advocates of the model have emphasized the importance of gene flow among different geographic populations, making their move toward modernity not independent but tied together as a genetic network over large geographical regions and over long periods of time. Since these populations were separated by great distances and experienced different kinds of environmental conditions, there was considerable regional variation in morphology among them.

One consequence of this widespread phyletic transformation would be that modern geographic populations would have very deep genetic roots, having begun to separate from each other a very long time ago, perhaps as much as a million years.

This model essentially sees multiple origins of Homo sapiens, and no necessary migrations.

===The &quot;Out-of-Africa&quot;/&quot;Replacement&quot; model===
This second hypothesis considers a geographically discrete origin, followed by migration throughout the rest of the Old World. By contrast with the first hypothesis, here we have a single origin and extensive migration.

Modern geographic populations would have shallow genetic roots, having derived from a speciation event in relatively recent times. Hominid populations were genetically isolated from each other during the Middle Pleistocene. As a result, different populations of Homo erectus and archaic Homo sapiens evolved independently, perhaps forming several hominid species. Then, between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans arose someplace in Africa and spread out, replacing other archaic sapiens including Neanderthals. The replacement model does not specify how anatomically modern humans usurped local populations. However, the model posits that there was little or no gene flow between hominid groups.

===Hypothesis testing===
If the &quot;Multi-regional Model&quot; were correct, then it should be possible to see in modern populations echoes of anatomical features that stretch way back into prehistory: this is known as regional continuity. In addition, the appearance in the fossil record of advanced humans might be expected to occur more or less simultaneously throughout the Old World. By contrast, the &quot;Out-of-Africa Model&quot; predicts little regional continuity and the appearance of modern humans in one locality before they spread into others.

===Out-of-Africa 2: The evidence===
Until relatively recently, there was a strong sentiment among anthropologists in favor of extensive regional continuity. In addition, Western Europe tended to dominate the discussions. Evidence has expanded considerably in recent years, and now includes molecular biology data as well as fossils. Now there is a distinct shift in favor of some version of the &quot;Out-of-Africa Model&quot;.

Discussion based on detailed examination of fossil record and mitochondrial DNA needs to address criteria for identifying:
* regional continuity;
* earliest geographical evidence (center of origin);
* chronology of appearance of modern humans.

===Fossil record===
====Regional Continuity====
The fossil evidence most immediately relevant to the origin of modern humans is to be found throughout Europe, Asia, Australasia, and Africa, and goes back in time as far as 300,000 years ago.

Most fossils are crania of varying degrees of incompleteness. They look like a mosaic of Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, and are generally termed archaic sapiens. It is among such fossils that signs of regional continuity are sought, being traced through to modern populations.

For example, some scholars (Alan Thorne) argue for such regional anatomical continuities among Australasian populations and among Chinese populations. In the same way, some others believe a good case can be made for regional continuity in Central Europe and perhaps North Africa.

====Replacement====
By contrast, proponents of a replacement model argue that, for most of the fossil record, the anatomical characters being cited as indicating regional continuity are primitive, and therefore cannot be used uniquely to link specific geographic populations through time.

The equatorial anatomy of the first modern humans in Europe presumably is a clue to their origin: Africa. There are sites from the north, east and south of the African continent with specimens of anatomical modernity. One of the most accepted is Klasies River in South Africa. The recent discovery of remains of H. sapiens idaltu at Herto (Ethiopia) confirms this evidence. Does this mean that modern Homo sapiens arose as a speciation event in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia), populations migrating north, eventually to enter Eurasia? This is a clear possibility.

The earlier appearance of anatomically moderns humans in Africa than in Europe and in Asia too supports the &quot;Out-of-Africa Model&quot;.

===Molecular biology===
Just as molecular evidence had played a major role in understanding the beginnings of the hominid family, so too could it be applied to the later history, in principle.

However, because that later history inevitably covers a shorter period of time - no more than the past 1 million years - conventional genetic data would be less useful than they had been for pinpointing the time of divergence between hominids and apes, at least 5 million years ago. Genes in cell nuclei accumulate mutations rather slowly. Therefore trying to infer the recent history of populations based on such mutations is difficult, because of the relative paucity of information. DNA that accumulates mutations at a much higher rate would, however, provide adequate information for reading recent population history. That is precisely what mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) offers.

MtDNA is a relatively new technique to reconstruct family trees. Unlike the DNA in the cell nucleus, mtDNA is located elsewhere in the cell, in compartments that produce the energy needed to keep cells alive. Unlike an individual's nuclear genes, which are a combination of genes from both parents, the mitochondrial genome comes only from the mother. Because of this maternal mode of inheritance, there is no recombination of maternal and paternal genes, which sometimes blurs the history of the genome as read by geneticists. Potentially, therefore, mtDNA offers a powerful way of inferring population history.

MtDNA can yield two major conclusions relevant for our topic: the first addresses the depth of our genetic routes, the second the possible location of the origin of anatomically modern humans.

===Expectations===
====Multiregional model:====
* extensive genetic variation, implying an ancient origin, going back at least a million years (certainly around 1.8 million years ago);
* no population would have significantly more variation than any other. Any extra variation the African population might have had as the home of ''Homo erectus'' would have been swamped by the subsequent million years of further mutation.

====Replacement model:====
* limited variation in modern mtDNA, implying a recent origin;
* African population would display most variation.

====Results====
# If modern populations derive from a process of long regional continuity, then mtDNA should reflect the establishment of those local populations, after 1.8 million years ago, when populations of Homo erectus first left Africa and moved into the rest of the Old World. Yet the absence of ancient mtDNA in any modern living population gives a different picture. The amount of genetic variation throughout all modern human populations is surprisingly small, and implies therefore a recent origin for the common ancestor of us all.
# Although genetic variation among the world's population is small overall, it is greatest in African populations, implying they are the longest established.
# If modern humans really did evolve recently in Africa, and then move into the rest of the Old World where they mated with established archaic sapiens, the resulting population would contain a mixture of old and new mtDNA, with a bias toward the old because of the relative numbers of newcomers to archaic sapiens. Yet the evidence does not seem to support this view.

The argument that genetic variation among widely separated populations has been homogenized by gene flow (interbreeding) is not tenable any more, according to population geneticists.

===Intermediate Model===
Although these two hypotheses dominate the debate over the origins of modern humans, they represent extremes; and there is also room for several intermediate models.
* One hypothesis holds that there might have been a single geographic origin as predicted by replacement model, but followed by migrations in which newcomers interbred with locally established groups of archaic sapiens. Thus, some of genes of Neanderthals and archaic H. sapiens may still exist in modern populations;
* Another hypothesis suggests that there could have been more extensive gene flow between different geographic populations than is allowed for in the multi-regional model, producing closer genetic continuity between populations. Anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa, and then their genes diffused to the rest of the world by gene flow, not by migration of anatomically modern humans and replacement of local peoples.

In any case the result would be a much less clearcut signal in the fossil record.

==Case studies==
===Southwest Asia===
Neanderthal fossils have been found in Israel at several sites: Kebara, Tabun, and Amud. For many years there were no reliable absolute dates. Recently, these sites were securely dated. The Neanderthals occupied Tabun around 110,000 years ago. However, the Neanderthals at Kebara and Amud lived 55,000 to 60,000 years ago. By contrast, at Qafzeh Cave, located nearby, remains currently interpreted as of anatomically modern humans have been found in a layer dated to 90,000 years ago.

These new dates lead to the surprising conclusion that Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans overlapped - if not directly coexisted - in this part of the world for a very long time (at least 30,000 years). Yet the anatomical evidence of the Qafzeh hominid skeletons reveals features reminiscent of Neanderthals. Although their faces and bodies are large and heavily built by today's standards, they are nonetheless claimed to be within the range of living peoples. Yet, a recent statistical study comparing a number of measurements among Qafzeh, Upper Paleolithic and Neanderthal skulls found those from Qafzeh to fall in between the Upper Paleolithic and Neanderthal norms, though slightly closer to the Neanderthals.

===Portugal===
The Lagar Velho 1 remains, found in a rockshelter in Portugal dated to 24,500 years ago, correspond to the complete skeleton of a four-year-old child.

This skeleton has anatomical features characteristic of early modern Europeans:
*prominent chin and certain other details of the mandible;
*small front teeth;
*characteristic proportions and muscle markings on the thumb;
*narrowness of the front of pelvis;
*several aspects of shoulder and forearm bones.

Yet, intriguingly, a number of features also suggest Neanderthal affinities:
*the front of the mandible which slopes backward despite the chin;
*details of the incisor teeth;
*pectoral muscle markings;
*knee proportions and short, strong lower-leg bones.

Thus, the Lagar Velho child appears to exhibit a complex mosaic of Neanderthal and early modern human features. This combination can only have resulted from a mixed ancestry; something that had not been previously documented for Western Europe. The Lagar Velho child is interpreted as the result of interbreeding between indigenous Iberian Neanderthals and early modern humans dispersing throughout Iberia sometime after 30,000 years ago. Because the child lived several millennia after Neanderthals were thought to have disappeared, its anatomy probably reflects a true mixing of these populations during the period when they coexisted and not a rare chance mating between a Neanderthal and an early modern human.

==Population dispersal into Australia/Oceania==
Based on current data (and conventional view), the evidence for the earliest colonization of Australia would be as follows:
* archaeologists have generally agreed that modern humans arrived on Australia and its continental islands, New Guinea and Tasmania, about 35,000 to 40,000 years ago, a time range that is consistent with evidence of their appearance elsewhere in the Old World well outside Africa;
* all hominids known from Greater Australia are anatomically modern Homo sapiens;
* emerging picture begins to suggest purposeful voyaging by groups possessed of surprisingly sophisticated boat-building and navigation skills;
* the only major feature of early Greater Australia archaeology that does NOT fit comfortably with a consensus model of modern human population expansion in the mid-Upper Pleistocene is the lithic technology, which has a pronounced Middle, rather than Upper, Paleolithic cast.

Over the past decade, however, this consensus has been eroded by the discovery and dating of several sites:
* Malakunanja II and Nauwalabila I, located in Arnhem Land, would be 50,000 to 60,000 years old;
* Jinmium yielded dates of 116,000 to 176,000 years ago.

Yet these early dates reveal numerous problems related to stratigraphic considerations and dating methods. Therefore, many scholars are skeptical of their value.

If accurate, these dates require significant changes in current ideas, not just about the initial colonization of Australia, but about the entire chronology of human evolution in the early Upper Pleistocene. Either fully modern humans were present well outside Africa at a surprisingly early date or the behavioral capabilities long thought to be uniquely theirs were also associated, at least to some degree, with other hominids.

As a major challenge, the journey from Southeast Asia and Indonesia to Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea would have required sea voyages, even with sea levels at their lowest during glacial maxima. So far, there is no archaeological evidence from Australian sites of vessels that could have made such a journey. However, what were coastal sites during the Ice Age are mostly now submerged beneath the sea.

==Summary==
Overall the evidence suggested by mitochondrial DNA is the following:
* the amount of genetic variation in human mitochondrial DNA is small and implies a recent origin for modern humans;
* the African population displays the greatest amount of variation; this too is most reasonably interpreted as suggesting an African origin.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==Stone tool industry==
[[File:Nucleus_Egypte_MHNT_PRE_2004.0.99.jpg|thumb|right|Flint tool found in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt]]
Neanderthals and their contemporaries seem to have been associated everywhere with similar stone tool industries, called the Mousterian (after Le Moustier Cave in France). Therefore no fundamental behavioral difference is noticeable. The implication may be that the anatomical differences between Neanderthals and near-moderns have more to do with climatic adaptation and genetic flow than with differences in behavior.

Archaeological sites are dominated by flake tools. By contrast, Acheulean sites are dominated by large handaxes and choppers. Handaxes are almost absent from Middle Paleolithic sites. Oldowan hominids used mainly flake tools as well. However, unlike the small, irregular Oldowan flakes, the Middle Paleolithic hominids produced quite symmetric, regular flakes using sophisticated methods.

The main method is called the Levallois and it involves three steps in the core reduction:
# the flintknapper prepares a core having one precisely shaped convex surface;
# then, the knapper makes a striking platform at one end of the core;
# finally, the knapper hits the striking platform, knocking off a flake whose shape is determined by the original shape of the core.

Mousterian tools are more variable than Acheulean tools. Traditionally tools have been classified into a large number of distinct types based on their shape and inferred function. Among the most important ones are:
* points;
* side scrapers, flake tools bearing a retouched edge on one or both sides;
* denticulates, flake tools with a succession of irregular adjacent notches on one or both sides.

[[File:Pointes_tardenoisiennes_Beaugency.jpg|thumb|right|Flint points found in Loiret, France]]
Francois Bordes found that Middle Paleolithic sites did not reveal a random mix of tool types, but fell into one of four categories that he called Mousterian variants. Each variant had a different mix of tool types. Bordes concluded that these sites were the remains of four wandering groups of
Neanderthals, each preserving a distinct tool tradition over time and structured much like modern ethnic groups.

Recent studies give reason to doubt Bordes' interpretation. Many archaeologists believe that the variation among sites results from differences in the kinds of activity performed at each locality. For example, Lewis Binford argued that differences in tool types depend on the nature of the site and the nature of the work performed. Some sites may have been base camps where people lived, while others may have been camps at which people performed subsistence tasks. Different tools may have been used at different sites for woodworking, hide preparation, or butchering prey.

Recently, however, microscopic studies of wear patterns on Mousterian tools suggest that the majority of tools were used mainly for woodworking. As a result, there seems to be no association between a tool type (such as a point or a side-scraper) and the task for which it was used.

[[File:Mousterian_points_and_scrapers_Wellcome_M0015182.jpg|thumb|right|Mousterian points and scrapers]]
Microscopic analyses of the wear patterns on Mousterian tools also suggest that stone tools were hafted, probably to make spears.

Mousterian hominids usually made tools from rocks acquired locally. Raw materials used to make tools can typically be found within a few kilometers of the site considered.

==Subsistence Patterns==
Neanderthal sites contain bones of many animals alongside Mousterian stone tools. European sites are rich in bones of red deer, fallow deer, bison, aurochs, wild sheep, wild goat and horse, while eland, wildebeest, zebra are found often at African sites. Archaeologists find only few bones of very large animals such as hippopotamus, rhinoceros and elephant, even though they were plentiful in Africa and Europe.

This pattern has provoked as much debate at similar ambiguity as for earlier hominids, regarding the type of food procurement responsible for the presence of these bones: hunting or scavenging.

Several general models have be offered to explain the Mousterian faunal exploitation:

===Obligate Scavenger Model===
Some archaeologists (such as Lewis Binford) believe that Neanderthals and their contemporaries in Africa never hunted anything larger than small antelope, and even these prey were acquired opportunistically, not as a result of planned hunts. Any bones of larger animals were acquired by
scavenging. As evidence in support of this view, the body parts which dominate (skulls and foot bones) are commonly available to scavengers. Binford believes that hominids of this period did not have the cognitive skills necessary to plan and organize the cooperative hunts necessary to bring down large prey. Mousterian hominids were nearly as behaviorally primitive as early Homo.

===Flexible Hunter-Scavenger Model===
Other scientists argue that Neanderthals likely were not obligate scavengers, but that during times when plant foods were abundant they tended to scavenger rather than hunt. At other times, when plant foods were less abundant, Neanderthals hunted regularly. Their interpretation is of a flexible faunal exploitation strategy that shifted between hunting and scavenging.

===Less-Adept Hunter Model===
Other scientists believe that Neanderthals were primarily hunters who regularly killed large animals. But they were less effective hunters than are modern humans. They point out that animal remains at Mousterian sites are often made up of one or two species:
::For example, at Klasies River, vast majority of bones are from eland.
The prey animals are large creatures, and they are heavily overrepresented at these sites compared with their occurrence in the local ecosystem. It is hard to see how an opportunistic scavenger would acquire such a non-random sample of the local fauna. One important feature of this model is that animal prey hunted such as eland are not as dangerous prey as buffalo. Middle Paleolithic hominids were forced to focus on the less dangerous (but less abundant) eland, because they were unable to kill the fierce buffalo regularly.

===Fully Adept Hunter Model===
Finally some scientists argue that scavenging was not a major component of the Middle Paleolithic diet and there is little evidence of a less effective hunting strategy. Skeletal element abundance and cut mark patterning would be consistent with hunting.

Overall, there is currently no evidence that Middle Paleolithic hominids differed from Upper Paleolithic hominids in scavenging or hunting, the most fundamental aspect of faunal exploitation. The differences that separate Middle Paleolithic hominids from modern hominids may not reside in scavenging versus hunting or the types of animals that they pursued. Differences in the effectiveness of carcass use and processing, with their direct implications for caloric yield, may be more important.

Neanderthals lacked sophisticated meat and fat storage technology, as well as productive fat rendering technology. At a minimum, the lack of storage capabilities and a lower caloric yield per carcass have forced Neanderthals to use larger foraging ranges to increase the likelihood of successful encounters with prey.

==Cannibalism==
Marks on human bones from Middle Paleolithic can be the result of two phenomena: violence and cannibalism.

===Violence===
Violence can be recognized on bone assemblages by:
*marks of weapons;
*cutmarks on skull produced by scalping;
*removal of heads and hands as trophies;
*breakage of faces;
*much less &quot;body processing&quot; than in case of cannibalism.
Evidence for violence in the Middle Paleolithic is extremely rare.

===Body processing and cannibalism===
By contrast, evidence of body processing and cannibalism is becoming more widespread at different times and in different geographical areas.

===Chronology===
::Lower Paleolithic
:::Sterkfontein (South Africa): cannibalism
:::Bodo cranium (Ethiopia): cannibalism
:::Atapuerca (Spain): cannibalism

::Middle Paleolithic (Neanderthals)
:::Krapina (Croatia): body processing
:::Moula-Guercy (France): cannibalism
:::Marillac (France): cannibalism
:::Combe-Grenal (France): cannibalism

::Middle Paleolithic (Homo sapiens idaltu)
:::Herto (Ethiopia): body processing

::Upper Paleolithic (with Neanderthals)
:::Vindija (Croatia): cannibalism
:::Zafarraya (Spain): cannibalism

:::Neolithic
::::Fontbrégoua (France): cannibalism

===Criteria===
Criteria required for a &quot;minimal taphonomic signature&quot; of cannibalism:
* breakage of bones (to get at marrow and brain);
* cut marks suggesting butchery;
* so-called anvil abrasions left where a bone has rested on a stone anvil whilst it is broken with a hammer stone;
* burning (after breakage and cutting);
* virtual absence of vertebrae (crushed or boiled to get at marrow and grease);
* &quot;pot polishing&quot; on the ends of bones which have been cooked and stirred in a clay pot.
These criteria '''must''' be found on '''both''' hominid and ungulate remains.
Finally the types of bones usually broken are the crania and limb bones.

==Patterns==
Different behavioral patterns toward the dead among Middle Paleolithic Neanderthals:
*Cannibalism: Moula-Guercy
**Human individuals defleshed and disarticulated.
**Bones smashed for marrow and brain.
*Mortuary practices with body processing:Krapina, Herto
**Postmortem processing of corpses with stone tools, probably in preparation for burial of cleaned bones.
**No evidence of marrow processing.
*Mortuary practices without body processing: Southwest Asia (Amud, Kebara, Shanidar)

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the next draft, the death of the &quot;fixity of species&quot; idea needs to be clarified. Section 1.1 says that LeClerc and Lamark moved beyond it, but the next section gives Darwin the credit for it. (The first Darwin section was very readably put together, by the way.)

It's not really clear why the three Selection bits (Individual, Directional, and Stabilizing) are subsections under &quot;Advantages and Disadvantages&quot;.

''In Darwin's day, the idea that natural selection could change a chimpanzee into a human... was unthinkable.'' -- I think this should be revised to avoid mentioning the chimpanzee-human thing. Although you do state &quot;apelike creature&quot; in the next paragraph, there are enough people who will seize on any chance to claim (incorrectly) that scientists think we descended from chimpanzees that it's best just not to give them any opening in the first place.

''But only a few endorsed Darwin's view that major changes occur through the accumulation of small variations.'' -- Should the eye dilemma be mentioned here, or would it be unnecessary detail? ([http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html PBS Evolution of the Eye])

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Potential Momentum==

In classical physics we know that kinematics can often be described by a potential energy alone. Now we've seen that in relativity the energy is just the temporal component of the momentum 4-vector, so we should expect the same of the potential energy. To see how this works, we'll reason by analogy from the classical case. 

For a free, non-relativistic particle of mass ''m'', the total energy ''E'' equals the kinetic energy ''K'' and is related to the momentum &amp;Pi; of the particle by

:&lt;math&gt; E = K = \frac{| \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2}{2m} \qquad \mbox{(free, non-relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt;

In the non-relativistic case, the momentum is  &amp;Pi;= ''m'''v''''', where '''v''' is the particle velocity.

If the particle is not free, but is subject to forces associated with a potential energy ''U''(''x'',''y'',''z''), then the equation must be modified to account for the contribution of ''U'' to the total energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = K = \frac{| \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2}{2m} \qquad \mbox{(non-free, non-relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt; 

The force on the particle is related to the potential energy by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = - \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} , \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \right) . &lt;/math&gt; 	

For a free, relativistic particle, we have
:&lt;math&gt; E = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(free, relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

The obvious way to add forces to the relativistic case is by rewriting this equation with a potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E - U = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} |^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(incomplete!)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

However &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Pi = (\Pi, E/c)&lt;/math&gt; is a four-vector, so an equation with something subtracted from just one of the components of this four-vector is not relativistically invariant. In other words, this equation doesn't obey the principle of relativity, and therefore cannot be correct!

How can we fix this problem? One way is to define a new four-vector with ''U/c'' being its timelike part and some new vector '''Q''' being its spacelike part:
:&lt;math&gt; \underline{Q} \equiv ( \mathbf{ Q} , U/c) \qquad \mbox{(potential four-momentum)} . &lt;/math&gt; 	

We then subtract '''Q''' from the momentum '''&amp;Pi;'''. When we do this, equation (13.5) becomes
:&lt;math&gt; E - U = ( | \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{ Q}|^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 )^{1/2} \qquad \mbox{(non-free, relativistic)} . &lt;/math&gt;

The quantity '''Q''' is called the potential momentum and &lt;u&gt;''Q''&lt;/u&gt; is the potential four-momentum.

If |'''&amp;Pi;'''-'''Q'''| is much smaller than ''mc'', this becomes approximately

:&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2m}\left( \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{Q} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This expression for the energy has the same form as the Hamiltonian we looked at for classical [[General Mechanics/Velocity Dependent Forces|velocity dependent forces]], so we know it predicts a force perpendicular to the velocity, when the condition is met. It turns out to be perpendicular even when the condition is met.

In classical physics the potential momentum is an optional extra. In relativity it is a necessary part of any potential field.

Some additional terminology is useful. We define
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ p} \equiv \boldsymbol{\Pi} - \mathbf{ Q} \qquad \mbox{(kinetic momentum}) &lt;/math&gt;

as the kinetic momentum since in the classical case it reduces to ''m'''v'''''. In order to avoid confusion, we rename '''&amp;Pi;''' the total momentum. Thus, the total momentum equals the kinetic plus the potential momentum, in analogy with energy.

This '''Chicken Cabbage Salad''' is a very easy way to make a tasty cabbage salad. It works well as both a side salad or a main dish. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 head [[cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]]
* 1 bunch of [[cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]]
* 1 bunch of [[cookbook:green onion|green onion]]s
* 1/2 cup [[cookbook:Almond|slivered almonds]], toasted
* 1/2 cup [[cookbook:Sunflower Seeds|sunflower seeds]]
* 2 packages of [[cookbook:Ramen|ramen noodles]], Oriential flavor
* 2 cooked [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1/2 cup of [[cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable]] or canola oil
* 1/2 cup of [[cookbook:rice vinegar|rice vinegar]]
* 1 packet of Oriental flavoring (from one of the Ramen packages)
* [[cookbook:Salt|Salt]], [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]], and [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] to taste


== Procedure ==
# [[cookbook:Chop|Chop]] the cabbage, cilantro (leaves only), and green onion until it is at an even consistency among the three. Mix together.
# Add the almonds and sunflower seeds.
# Break up the ramen noodles and place in the salad.
# Mix oil, rice vinegar, and flavoring. This is now your dressing.
# Put dressing over salad and add salt and pepper to taste
# Leave salad to sit and absorb flavor for an hour for best taste.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Vegetarian Chicken Patties can be used to replace the chicken breasts
* Cooked and cooled ramen noodles can be used for those who don't like crunchy noodles in their salad.
* Try browning the noodles &amp; nuts in a little butter, let them cool, and sprinkle on salad. Yum.

== Law of Gravitation ==

Of Newton's accomplishments, the discovery of the universal law of gravitation ranks as one of his greatest. Imagine two masses, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, separated by a distance ''r''. The gravitational force has the magnitude 

:&lt;math&gt; F_g = G \frac{M_1 M_2}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the ''gravitational constant'':

:&lt;math&gt;G \approx 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \frac{m^3}{kg \cdot s^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The force is always attractive, and acts along the line joining the centre of the two masses.

== Vector Notation ==

Let's say that we have two masses, M and m, separated by a distance r, and a distance vector '''R'''. The relationship between '''R''' and r is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;|\vec{\mathbf{R}}| = r&lt;/math&gt;

We will also change our force into a force vector, acting in the direction of '''R''':

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_g = G \frac{M_1 M_2}{r^2} \cdot \frac{\vec{\mathbf{R}}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

And this gives us our final vector equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_g = G \frac{M_1 M_2 \vec{\mathbf{R}}}{r^3} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that since the ratio between '''R''' and r is normalized, the addition of these terms does not alter the equation, only the direction in which the force is acting.</text>

''Salting'' is a method of preserving food, that was more common before modern refrigeration.

Salting preserves food by drawing water out of the food, preventing bacteria growing and spoiling the food.

There are two methods of salting food:

'''Dry Curing'''

The food is surrounded in salt and left in a cool dry place. As water will be drawn out into the salt it may be necessary to pour the liquid the accumulates out.
 
'''Wet Curing'''

A brine is prepared by dissolving salt in water, the food is then placed in the brine and left in a cool dry place. It is possible to introduce new flavours to the food by adding spices to the brine, for example juniper berries or peppercorns.

Depending on how much salt is used the food could last for a few months to a few years, and the technique adds flavor as well, though some do not like the taste of salted foods. Salted food is very salty and may need to be reconstituted, to reintroduce water and remove some of the salt.

Some popular salted foods are [[Cookbook:Lox|Lox]] and the less salty (and thus less preserved)
counterpart Nova Lox.</text>

 [[Image:White_Alaskan_Salmon.jpg|250px|thumb|White Alaskan Salmon]]
'''Salmon''' is a very popular fish, being large and high in omega-3 fatty acids. Canned salmon is high in calcium because the bones have been softened and are eaten with the [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]]. Salmon is particularly popular in the American Jewish community. The eggs are sometimes eaten as a [[Cookbook:Caviar|caviar]] substitute. 

The line-caught variety is especially prized and expensive. Much like flamingos, wild salmon gain their pink or red color from the krill (small [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]]-like animals) that they eat. Color differences indicate food source differences. Farm-raised salmon are artificially colored by feeding them a dye that tends to remain in flesh. The dye has been shown to remain in humans, including the retina, which can be damaging to eyesight. Farm-raised salmon taste somewhat like [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], likely due to the feed being used. Farm-raised salmon can be recognized by the wider [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]-filled or goo-filled gaps between the flakes of meat.

When purchasing fish, freshness is important. The fish should not have a ''fishy'' smell, which actually comes from bacteria decomposing the fish. If purchasing whole fish, the eyes should be clear. Frozen-at-sea fish are often the freshest choice available.

[[Cookbook:Trout|Trout]] may be substituted for salmon.

Holland tea cakes are simple flat cookies. They are easy and quick to make. They are traditionally 
Christmas cookies but are good for any time. They last for a long time so if you make too many they can be saved.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 stick [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (preferably melted)
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (separated)
*2 cups (280g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1-2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] (more or less to taste)
* Colored sugar or nuts for topping

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). 
#Mix the butter and sugar until completely mixed. Add egg yolk and mix some more. Add flour and cinnamon and mix thoroughly preferably by hand (though this all can be done in a mixer if you insist).
#Pour batter into a cookie pan, spread over the whole pan use the palm of your hand to smooth the batter (this is the hardest part), and brush on leftover egg white. 
#Add whatever toppings you want spread evenly across the batter (see below).  
#Put cookie sheet in oven until cookies are golden brown (about 20 minutes). Remove, and let cool. Before they get too cool, cut them into small squares about 1 in by 1 in (2.5cm x 2.5cm).

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Egg substitutes can be used in place of the egg yolk, but you still need egg white for the topping.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Food Production==
The ways in which humans procure resources are not unlimited. Essentially, there are five major procurement patterns practiced in the world today:
*Food collection
**hunting and gathering
*Food production
**extensive agriculture
**intensive agriculture
**pastoralism
**industrialism

==Food Collection: Hunting and Gathering==
People who practice a hunting and gathering subsistence strategy simply rely on whatever food is available in their local habitat, for the most part collecting various plant foods, hunting wild game, and fishing (where the environment permits).

They collect but they do not produce any food. For example, crops are not cultivated and animals are not kept for meat or milk. Hunters and gathers do and did modify the landscape to increase the amount of available food. One of the main ways hunters and gatherers modified their environment was through the use of burning. Today, only about 30,000 people make their living in this fashion.

Cultures of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture agriculturalists], having larger [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint ecological footprints] have pushed most hunters and gatherers out of the areas where plant food and game is abundant into the more marginal of the earth: the Arctic, arid deserts, and dense tropical rain forests.

==Food Production: Terminology==

'''Food Production:''' General term which covers types of domestication involving both plants and
animals, each of which requires radically different practices.

'''Cultivation:''' Term refers to all types of plant culture, from slash-and-burn to growing
crop trees. Terminological distinctions within the term cultivation are based on types on gardens maintained and means with which they are cultivated. Example: distinction between horticulture and agriculture

:'''Horticulture:''' Refers to smaller-scale, garden-based cultivation, usually of a mixed variety of plant species, often with relatively simple tools.

:'''Agriculture:''' This practice requires tools of greater complexity or higher energy in their manufacture and use, such as animal traction, etc.

:'''Slash-and-burn:''' Strategy, normally horticultural, in which forest or bush land is cleared by chopping and burning the less useful wood species, planting in the ashes, harvesting for several years and then moving on to a new plot of land.

:'''&quot;Non-domestication&quot; vs. &quot;pre-domestication&quot; cultivation:''' Cultivation of crops in some cases does not induce domestication. Example of such methods common among hunter-gatherers: beating the plants or reaping them when they are ripe. Therefore called &quot;non-domestication cultivation.&quot; Other methods can induce the domestication of wild-type crops: uprooting or reaping grasses not ripe or nearly ripe using sickles. Therefore called &quot;pre-domestication cultivation&quot;

'''Animal Husbandry:''' Term refers to all types of animal rearing practices, ranging from chicken to cattle.

:'''Pastoralism:''' Term normally used to refer to subsistence-oriented livestock production in which some animals or animal products are sold or bartered for food or other commodities, but family reproduction relies largely on the herds. Animals featured in this way of life vary according to regions and include cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses.

{{High School Mathematics Extensions/Supplementary/TOC}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Introduction ==
Before we begin, consider the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1\times2}+\frac{1}{2\times3}+\frac{1}{3\times4}......+\frac{1}{99\times100}&lt;/math&gt;

How do we calculate this sum? At first glance it may seem difficult, but if you use variables instead of numbers each term in the sum above would take the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n\times(n + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

which you can rewrite as 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(n + 1) - n}{n\times(n + 1)} = \frac{(n+1)}{n\times(n + 1)}-\frac{n}{n\times(n + 1)} = \frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can rewrite the original problem as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{1}-\frac{1}{2})+(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3})+(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4})+......+(\frac{1}{99}-\frac{1}{100})&lt;/math&gt;

Regrouping:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1}+(-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2})+(-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3})+....+(-\frac{1}{99}+\frac{1}{99})-\frac{1}{100})&lt;/math&gt;

So all terms except the first and the last cancel out, yielding:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1\times2}+\frac{1}{2\times3}+\frac{1}{3\times4}......+\frac{1}{99\times100}=1-\frac{1}{100}=\frac{99}{100}&lt;/math&gt;

Believe it or not, we've just done partial fractions! 

Partial fractions is a method of breaking down complex fractions which involve products into sums of simpler fractions.

== General method ==
So, how do we do partial fractions? Look at the example below:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4z-5}{z^2-3z+2}&lt;/math&gt;

Factorizing the denominator:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4z-5}{(z-1)(z-2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we suppose we '''can''' break it down into two fractions with denominator ''(z - 1)'' and ''(z - 2)'' respectively, let their numerators be ''a'' and ''b:''&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4z-5}{(z-1)(z-2)} = \frac{a}{z-1}+\frac{b}{z-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by ''(z - 1)(z - 2)'':
:&lt;math&gt;4z-5 = a(z-2) + b(z-1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4z-5 = az-2a+bz-b&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4z-5 = (a+b)z-(2a+b)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore by matching coefficients of like power of z, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
a+b=4 &amp; (\text{A}) \\
2a+b=5 &amp; (\text{B})
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore:

:&lt;math&gt;
(\text{B})-(\text{A}) : a = 1 \to b = 3
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4z-5}{z^2-3z+2}=\frac{1}{z-1}+\frac{3}{z-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Generally speaking, this method only works with proper fractions. Numerators with greater exponents than their denominators need to be [[../Polynomial Division|divided]] first.

== Power factors ==
On the last section we have talked about factorizing the denominator, and have each factor as the denominator of each term. But what happens when there are repeating factors? Can we apply the same method? See the example below:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4x-1}{(x+2)^2(x-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Other than the method suggested above, we would like to use another approach to handle the problem. We first leave out some factor to make it into non-repeated form, do partial fraction on it, then multiply the factor back, then apply partial fraction on the 2 fractions.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+2} \times \frac{4x-1}{(x+2)(x-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Partial fraction on the latter part:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4x-1}{(x+2)(x-1)} = \frac{a}{x+2} + \frac{b}{x-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by ''(x + 2)(x - 1)'':
:&lt;math&gt;4x-1 = a(x-1) + b(x+2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4x-1 = a(x-1)+b(x+2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4x-1 \equiv (a+b)x + (2b-a)&lt;/math&gt;

By matching coefficients of like power of x, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
a+b = 4 &amp; (\text{A}) \\
2b-a = -1 &amp; (\text{B})
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute ''a = 4 - b'' into ''(B)'',
:&lt;math&gt;2b-(4-b) = -1&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''b = 1'' and ''a = 3''.

We carry on:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+2} \times \left ( \frac{3}{x+2} + \frac{1}{x-1} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{(x+2)^2} + \frac{1}{(x+2)(x-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we do partial fraction once more:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(x+2)(x-1)} = \frac{a}{x+2} + \frac{b}{x-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by ''(x + 2)(x - 1)'':
:&lt;math&gt;1 = a(x-1) + b(x+2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1 = (a+b)x + (2b-a)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0x + 1 = (a+b)x + (2b-a)&lt;/math&gt;

By matching coefficients of like power of x , we have:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
a+b = 0 &amp; (\text{A}) \\
2b-a = 1 &amp; (\text{B})
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute ''a = -b'' into ''(B)'', we have:
:&lt;math&gt;2b-(-b) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''b = 1/3'' and ''a = -1/3''.

So finally,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4x-1}{(x+2)^2(x-1)} = \frac{3}{(x+2)^2} - \frac{1}{3(x+2)} + \frac{1}{3(x-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

== Quadratic factors ==
We should always try to factor the denominator, for the sake of simplicity. There are some cases, though, in which factoring a polynomial leads to complex coefficients. Since these do anything but simplify our task, we shall leave the polynomial ''as it is''. That is, as irreducible quadratic factors:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{7x^2+22x+25}{x^3+3x^2+2x+6} = \frac{7x^2+22x+25}{(x+3)(x^2+2)}&lt;/math&gt;

When dealing with the quadratic factor, we should use the following partial fraction:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{bx + c}{x^2+2}&lt;/math&gt;

Leading to:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{7x^2+22x+25}{(x+3)(x^2+2)} = \frac{a}{x+3} + \frac{bx + c}{x^2+2}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by ''(x + 3)(x^2 + 2)'':
:&lt;math&gt;7x^2+22x+25 = a(x^2+2) + (bx + c)(x+3)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;7x^2+22x+25 = a(x^2+2) + (bx + c)(x+3)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;7x^2+22x+25 = (a+b)x^2+(3b+c)x+(2a+3c)&lt;/math&gt;

By matching coefficients of like power of x , we have:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
a+b = 7 &amp; (\text{A}) \\
3b+c = 22 &amp; (\text{B}) \\
2a+3c = 25 &amp; (\text{C})
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Solving:
:&lt;math&gt;(\text{C})-2(\text{A})-3(\text{B}) = (\text{C})-2(\text{A})-3(\text{B})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(2a+3c)-2(a+b)-3(3b+c) = 25 - 2(7) - 3(22)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-11b = -55&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore ''b = 5'', ''a = 2'' and ''c = 7''.

Finally:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{7x^2+22x+25}{(x+3)(x^2+2)} = \frac{2}{x+3} + \frac{5x + 7}{x^2+2}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

Electronics is the application of electromagnetic (and quantum) theory to construct devices that can perform useful tasks, from as simple as electrical heaters or light bulbs to as complex as the Large Hadron Collider.

{{SUBPAGENAME}};component of electronics'''

=Electronics=
==Introduction==
To discuss electronics we need the basic concepts from electricity: '''charge''', '''current''' which is flow of charge, and '''potential''' which is the potential energy difference between two places. Please make sure these concepts are familiar before continuing.

==Circuits==
The interest of electronics is circuits. A circuit consists of '''wires''' that connect '''components'''. Typical components are '''resistors''', '''voltage sources''. In order to maintain a constant electrical current a continued exhaustion of chemical or mechanical energy is required.

A voltaic cell is a common electromotive power source for a circuit. It consists primarily of two plates, a positive copper plate and a negative zinc plate. One must note that the plates are placed in dilute sulfuric acid. Whence a key is switched or the circuit is closed the zinc reacts with the sulfuric in which it is placed in. One may discern that the electromotive force which is then applied to the circuit is believed to be converted from chemical to electrical energy upon the surface of the zinc cell. Whence the E.M.F is converted from chemical to electrical energy the electromotive force travels through the sulfuric acid. However disadvantages occur whence utilizing a voltaic or galvanic cell. Whence the circuit is closed, simultaneously hydrogen bubbles accumulate upon the copper plate surface hence decreasing the total electromotive power source applied to the circuit in question. The resistance with which the electromotive source encounters as it flows form the zinc plate to the copper plate through the dilute sulfuric acid is distinguished as internal resistance. Hence the voltaic cell uses diluted rather than concentrated sulfuric acid so as to reduce the internal resistance present inside of the component which applies the electromotive force to the circuit.

A circuit can be '''open''', when there is a break so that no current can flow, or it can be '''closed''', so that current can flow. These definitions allow us to discuss electronics efficiently.

==Direct current and alternating current==

==Basic components==

==Ohm's law==
IF 'V' IS POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE  APPLIED AT TWO ENDS OF CONDUCTOR AND 'I' IS CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH THE CONDUCTOR THEN 'I' IS DIRECTLY PROPORTION TO ITS 'V'
'''V = I x R'''

==Kirchoff's laws==
Kirchoff's laws generally hold for [[Electronics/DC Voltage and Current|direct current (DC)]] circuits, but fail when dealing with changing electric current and voltage such as [[Electronics/AC Voltage and Current|alternating current (AC)]] or signal processing in combination with [[Electronics/Capacitors|capacitors]], [[Electronics/Inductors|inductors]], and [[Communication Systems/Antennas|antennas]].

=== Kirchoff's current law ===
The sum of all the currents entering and leaving any point in a circuit is equal to zero.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;
It is based on the assumption that current flows only in conductors, and that whenever current flows into one end of a conductor it immediately flows out the other end.

=== Kirchoff's voltage law ===
The sum of all the voltages around the circuit loop is equal to zero.
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;
It is based on the assumption that there is no fluctuating magnetic field linking the closed circuit loop.

==Power==
p=work done/time taken
p=I*V (current * Voltage)

==Resistors in series==
R&lt;math&gt;eq&lt;/math&gt;=R&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;+R&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;+R&lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;+--------

==Resistors in parallel==

1/R = 1/R1+1/R2+1/R3+......

==Superposition of sources==

==Capacitors==
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;C={Q\over V}&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;C_{\rm series}=\sum_n{1\over C_n}={1\over C_1}+{1\over C_2}+{1\over C_3}+\cdots+{1\over C_n}&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;C_{\rm parallel}=\sum_n C_n=C_1+C_2+C_3+\cdots+C_n&lt;/math&gt;}}

==Inductances==

==Frequency-dependent circuits==

==Semiconductors==



{{PSG/eq | &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{Q}{T}&lt;/math&gt; }}

Current is the rate of flow of charge.

&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; = Current [amperes - A]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; = Charge [coulombs - C]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = Time [seconds - s]&lt;br /&gt;

{{PSG/eq | &lt;math&gt;V = IR\ &lt;/math&gt;}}

[http://www.howstuffworks.com howstuffworks.com]

Voltage is equal to current multiplied by resistance

Power is equal to the product of voltage and current

Electronics is the flow of current through semiconductor devices like silicon and germanium.

Semiconductor devices are those which behave like conductors at higher temperature.

Transistor, diode, SCR are some electronic devices.

Why is there no boarder with table?

== Problem on the solution ==

On the questions about NAND, I've find the answer that's simplier,using only six NAND operators.

{[(x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)] NAND w} NAND (z NAND z)


Solution:
Let (x+y)w+z = a NAND b , where a and b can either be one of x,y,w,z or another NAND operator.

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z=(ab)'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z=a'+b'&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;a=[(x+y)w]'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=z'&lt;/math&gt; , both need further NAND operators. Let a = c NAND d , and let b = e NAND f.

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z={(cd)'}^{'}+{(ef)'}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)w+z=cd+ef&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore d=w, e=f=z,c=x+y.Let c = g NAND h.

&lt;math&gt;x+y=(gh)'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x+y=g'+h'&lt;/math&gt;

Now g=x' and h=y', we still need more NAND operators. Let g = i NAND j and let h = k NAND l.

&lt;math&gt;(ij)'=x'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=ij&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(kl)'=y'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;kl=y&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore i=j=x and k=l=y.

Now substitute all the variables back, you should get:

(x+y)w+z={[(x NAND x) NAND (y NAND y)] NAND w} NAND (z NAND z)

Thanks.

: Mahayana Dictum - &quot;Emptiness is form and form is emptiness&quot; can be expressed as a formula: 

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\infin=1=0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

: Esoteric Buddhist Schools include: Tendai, Shingon, Tantric and are the antithesis of the [[../Yinyana/]] and other open systems. Often based on supernatural teachings incorporating traditional beliefs (and superstitions), they nonetheless integrate some depth psychology and healing methods.

=== Introduction ===
Esoteric Buddhism is generally classified under the Great Vehicle (Mahayana) Buddhism. There are two parts to it: the [[Exoteric]] and the [[Esoteric]] Buddhism. In order for us to understand Esoteric Buddhism, we need to explore the origins as well the constituent philosophy and historical context of how the respective schools were established.

Exoteric Buddhism is based on [[w:en:Madhyamika|Madhyamika]] ('middle way') of Nagarjuna. 

Esoteric Buddhism requires the study of Exoteric Buddhism as the foundation. Esoteric Buddhism is taught to practitioners as an 'advanced' dharma.

=== Doctrine ===
The doctrine of the Esoteric (or Tantric) Buddhism is based on [[w:en:Vairocana|''Mahavairocana-sutra'']], and [[w:en:Kalachakra|''Kalacakraindriya-sutra'']]. The following may best explain the doctrine: 
* Taking the six elements as essence
* [[w:en:Five_Wisdom_Buddhas|Five Wisdom Buddhas]]
* Taking the four [[w:en:Mandala|mandalas]] as appearance
* Taking the three secrets as means
* Cause, base, final means
* Anger and fear

Please feel free to add your own questions and answers!

=Interview with &quot;The Fridge&quot;=

==Are you known as 'the Fridge' because you are a kewl programmer?==
When last time I had a temperature I wasn't so kewl. I think Fridge is the transcription of the German word &quot;Fritte&quot; (like potato chips) which is my nickname in Germany.

==Is Curl evolutionary or revolutionary?==
This binary question is not so easily answered. Curl is of course evolutionary because there have been  other programming languages before. It wouldn't be the MIT if they hadn't learnt from previous mistakes. On the other hand Curl comes with a revolutionary license policy. Don't ask for details the answer might take months.

==What is your favourite piece of Curl programming? Hint: try and include curlchat==
I would say the &quot;Hello World&quot; program, as it nicely shows how markup language is integrated in the object-oriented programming language. There are also some really good applications around, most of them are not available on the net but have a look a www.curlchat.info for example and you will know what I mean.

==Can Curl be used for programming mobile phones or PDA's?==
No, not yet. If the Asian market produces enough revenue there might be a possibility that Curl is ported to these devices.

==Why is your baby son a worshipped deity?==
I don't understand the question.

==How does Curl fit in with the Semantic Web?== 
Oh, a technical question. Curl is great in collection information and preparing them in a sensible way. Yes, Curl programs can give meaning to a arbitrary sets of data retrieved from different sources.

==What is your connection to alchemy and time travel?==
Yesterday, I was working with Curl version 4.2 that was released in 1992. But unfortunately, I was already so rich (look at all these gold nuggets on my desk) that I couldn't to see the ingenuity of the release.

==Why are you so keen on Curl?==
Because. Do you really want a personal answer?

The form &quot;Vós&quot; (plural &quot;you&quot;) is NOT outdated. it is used in the northern Portugal, among northern dialects speakers. Also it is NOT formal there.

==Capitalization==
It is probably a good idea to avoid capitalizing the pronouns, except when it is required (for example, at the start of a sentence).  [[User:Chonak|Chonak]] 17:58, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

== he/she ==

 Suggestion: 
In Portuguese the undetermined gender is masculine, without the use of ''ele/ela'' (''he/she''). This politically correct construction in English, and the lack of it in Portuguese, could be developed in this article. (Right now I don't have enough  references to deal with this.)[[Special:Contributions/66.18.232.233|66.18.232.233]] ([[User talk:66.18.232.233|discuss]]) 21:09, 11 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Of [[Ruby Programming|Ruby]] GUI bindings, the Tk binding is the oldest; it is widely available and still more or less the default toolkit for GUI programming with Ruby. Nevertheless, currently there exists no comprehensive manual for Ruby/Tk; the Ruby book recommends inferring Ruby/Tk usage from the Perl/Tk documentation.

The current Ruby &quot;PickAxe book&quot; has a chapter on [http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/ Ruby/Tk].

== Documentation ==

* There&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good tutorial www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_tk_guide.htm .

* There are some pleasantly looking tutorials at [http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html tkdocs.com] (it&amp;rsquo;s not really Tk&amp;rsquo;s official site).

* After having introducted yourself to the concepts of Tk you should also be able to read [http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/contents.htm TclTk&amp;rsquo;s official reference] (this is also available as man pages on Unix or a CHM file on Windows&lt;ref&gt;The ActiveState package for Windows, mentioned above, contains the documentation as a CHM file.&lt;/ref&gt;).

You may also be able to comfortably read PerlTk&amp;rsquo;s documentation as the Ruby bindings are said to be modeled after Perl&amp;rsquo;s.

== Look and Feel ==

The &amp;ldquo;look and feel&amp;rdquo; of your Tk application depends on the version of the Tk library your Ruby interpreter is linked against:

* '''Tk 8.4''' and below is notorious for its &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo; look. The widgets have the outdated Motif look and feel, and, on Unix-based systems&lt;ref&gt;&amp;ldquo;on X-Window systems&amp;rdquo;, to be exact.&lt;/ref&gt;, bitmap fonts are used.

* '''Tk 8.5''' and above look more modern. It is shipped with the Tile theming engine&lt;ref&gt;The Tile theming engine can be installed on older Tk 8.x libraries as well.&lt;/ref&gt;, and widgets now look native to the hosting platform&lt;ref&gt;Though you may have to &amp;ldquo;turn on&amp;rdquo; this feature (?).&lt;/ref&gt;. On Unix-based systems outline fonts are now used.

== Availability ==

If the Tk toolkit isn&amp;rsquo;t already installed on your system, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install it. You may use your system&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;package manager&amp;rdquo; for this.

If you built Ruby before having installed the Tk dev package, it&amp;rsquo;s likely that it was built without Tk built in. For 1.9 versions you might be able to get away with installing it [http://github.com/rdp/tk_as_gem as a gem] but your best bet is to install the tk dev package and reinstall Ruby so that it builds with the Tk bindings.

==== Windows ====

By default the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; one click installer has the Tk binaries, however you&amp;rsquo;ll still need to install the Tk toolkit from [http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/ ActiveState] .

If you&amp;rsquo;re using the new &amp;ldquo;rubyinstaller&amp;rdquo; then for 1.8.6 this [http://github.com/rdp/ruby_windows_tk might help] or for 1.9 this [http://github.com/rdp/tk_as_gem might help]

There&amp;rsquo;s a precompiled gem which should work out-of-the-box: [http://rubygems.org/gems/tk-win tk-win].&lt;br /&gt;
It includes sources and libraries directly from Hidetoshi NAGAI. It&amp;rsquo;s Ruby 1.9 only.

You could also try the [http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/204303#new ffi-tk] gem, or download [http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/210186#new this] for 1.9 mingw users.

The hope is that future versions of rubyinstaller will come with the binaries built in, then the above work-arounds won&amp;rsquo;t be necessary.

== Alternatives ==

A few more gui toolkits are compared [http://wiki.github.com/rdp/ruby_talk_faq/ruby-gui-toolkit-comparison here].

The Wikibooks Voter's Guide is a project designed to educate potential voters on how to vote, as well as the possible benefits and disadvantages of voting in particular ways.  Though this is the English Wikibooks project and all Voter's Guides contained herein should be in English, there should be intense cooperation and interlinking to ensure that voters can access a Voter's Guide for their country and in their native language.  To this end, the English project should have English language guides to elections in countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Jamaica, guides should also be made available in English for any country, even non-Anglophone lands like China, Japan and France.

*[[/Australia/]]
*[[/Canada/]]
*[[/New Zealand/]]
*[[/United Kingdom/]]
*[[/United States/]]

Each Voter's Guide should have several sections (using the US as an example):
*Brief stuff to be given out at polling stations:
**[[Voter's Guide/United States/Candidates/Presidential]]: Brief information, short enough to be given out at polling stations and read just before voting, on the platforms of the candidates for President of the United States
**[[Voter's Guide/United States/Candidates/Congressional]]: Brief information, short enough to be given out at polling stations and read just before voting, on the platforms of the candidates for Senator or Representative, divided by state (e.g. [[Voter's Guide/United States/Congressional candidates/Alaska]])
*In-depth info, too long to be portable or easily distributable
**[[Voter's Guide/United States/Elections/Congressional]]: More in depth information on the candidates and issues behind the election; information on how and why (and why not) strategic voting can be harmful or beneficial
**[[Voter's Guide/United States/Democratic Party]]: Information on the platform and history of the Democratic Party (this is an example of one Party Guide)
**[[Voter's Guide/United States/George W. Bush]]: Simple biographical information, followed by long list of positions taken, bills supported/opposed, promises made (with info on if kept) (this is an example of one Candidate Guide)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I had this idea the other day, and I'm excited about it.  I think this is a way that Wikibooks and the rest of Wikimedia's projects could gain some publicity and respect.  I could easily see that, by the 2008 US election, we could have well-developed guides to the issues, parties and candidates, vetted by people of all political stripes and found neutral, and available in a dozen or more languages... This will require a number of participants, however, of diverse backgrounds. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 00:54, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== NPOV implies Wikipedia article ==

When an issue is described with a NPOV, it should be in Wikipedia, leaving the contentious, left vs right, issues summarized here, with the relevant interwikilinks, of course. in fact, the Wikipedia article will also benefit from a summary of the contentious issues explained more here too.
[[User:Mark Hurd|Mark Hurd]] 10:04, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:Um, [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] is a policy across all of Wikimedia, it is not limited to Wikipedia.  That being said, each project applies it differently, and the Voter Guide will need to have a special application of the policy, as the Wikimedia Foundation could loose it's non-profit status in the US (where the foundation is located) if it violates certin campaign laws, such as endorsing a particular candidate for office. There was a short discussion of this earlier on the Foundation-l mailing list. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 12:26, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::I agree that neutrality is important here.  Also, the Voter's Guide should focus on which candidates and parties hold the various positions.  There should indeed by summaries of why people hold different opinions, but I agree that the nitty-gritty should be in Wikipedia.  I think the purpose of the Voter's Guide should be to point voters who already have at least a vague idea of where they stand on the issues to the candidates who best represent those positions.  For example, we can summarize the gun control arguments and explain what various pieces of legislation mean, with the primary purpose of explaining which politicians hold various views -- all the historical details and such should be at Wikipedia, and we should be liberally interlinking with those articles. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 17:54, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

==Wikipedia-related idea==

On Wikipedia, I nominated &quot;Voter education&quot; for collaboration of the week. But it needs two more votes by Oct. 17 to avoid removal.

==Just some notes on potential structures==
Feel free to comment - [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 04:43, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

(Since I haven't thought of a remotely usable name for the whole proposal, I'm just calling it The Guide for the moment)

The Guide's purpose should be to encourage an educated debate of controversial issues and to provide a neutral database of information to help guide newcomers to our subjects.  Note that by &quot;encouraging an educated debate&quot;, I don't mean actually holding debates, but rather giving a one-stop source for information on why beliefs are held.

===Departments===
:''Voter's Guide'': Collects information on specific elections, parties and candidates
::''Voter's Guide:George W. Bush'' with standardized subpages like maybe ''Voter's Guide:George W. Bush - Voting Record'' or ''Campaign Funding'' and the like.
::''Voter's Guide:Democratic Party'' with standardized subpages on whatever seems important
::''Voter's Guide:U.S. presidential election, 2008'' with subpages if needed
:::We don't limit the notability of elections for any local, provincial or state elections.  We should also allow for voter's guides for things like unions and other large organizations, but not for every podunk clubhouse, so there should be a line somewhere.
:''Issue Guide'': (or a better name) collection of relevant facts and arguments on a particular debate
::We should also have a guide to debates of fact.  Maybe ''Issue Guide:Number of civilian Iraqis killed during the US occupation of Iraq'', for example, where we could collect information on the different numbers that have been produced, explaining how they were derived.  Also [[Issue Guide:Change in homelessness during the Bush Administration]]
::Maybe a separate section for conspiracy theories
::We should have a section for brief explanations of logical fallacies of all kinds.  This would be useful to link to.
::Need to set a line for issues.  [[Issue Guide:How much does Pantera RAWK!?]] is out, but [[Issue Guide:Nu Metal]], if done in a neutral fashion, would be fine.  What about, however, critical reviews of movies and the like? Perhaps even expand into all manner of opinions and provide a meta-database of critical reviews of movies, albums and books.
::A standardized method of citing scholarly journals.  Say, on medical marijuana or the effects of secondhand smoke.
::We should treat all opinions equally, assuming they are not idiosyncratic.  I mean really ''equally'', irregardless of popularity -- should [[Voter's Guide:Barack Obama]] document that some may not want to vote for him because he is black?  With a link to [[Issue Guide:White Supremacy]], of course.  I think so, since it isn't our place to judge the reasonableness of opinions -- we provide documentation of reasons why people hold opinions.
::The namespace ''Issue Guide'' should be for overviews of a particular dispute.  The namespace ''Morality'' should be for examining moral claims that are inherently unprovable.  The namespace ''Factual Claim'' should be used for (theoretically) verifiable statements such as those involving history and statistics.  The namespace ''Premise'' should be used for other claims which rely on unverifiable statements but are not direct moral claims (such as funding priorities, justifications for specific bills and actions).

==Name suggestions==
Please, we need names

For the overarching project consisting of the Issue Guide, the Voter's Guide and all related paraphernalia.  This is the one that really should begin with ''Wiki'':
*Some words to consider: [[wiktionary:en:forum|en:forum]], [[wiktionary:en:concord|en:concord]], [[wiktionary:en:summit|en:summit]], [[wiktionary:en:dispute|en:dispute]], [[wiktionary:en:controversy|en:controversy]], [[wiktionary:en:issue|en:issue]], [[wiktionary:en:debate|en:debate]], [[wiktionary:en:parliament|en:parliament]], [[wiktionary:en:congress|en:congress]], [[wiktionary:en:feast|en:feast]], [[wiktionary:en:senate|en:senate]] (mediators in ancient Rome were called internuncius, medium, intercessor, philantropus, interpolator, conciliator, interlocutor, interpres, and finally mediator)
::'''Other words''':
*''k'e'' - Navajo, meaning ''solidarity and reciprocity'' or ''what I do has an impact on you and what you do has an impact on me''
*''hozhooji naat’aanii'' - Navajo, meaning ''peacemaking'' or ''people talking together to re-form relationships with each other and the universe'', combination of the words for ''rightness'' and ''to talk''
*''ki-ah-m'' - Cree, meaning ''law'' or ''for everything you do, good or bad, there are consequences'', similar to the Zulu ''ubuntu'' (which is also defined as ''an attitude of
togetherness in spirit and humanness''), and is also compared to Navajo ''k'e'' and Lakota ''ti ospaye''
*''Another example of peace-building mechanism comes from the Banyarwanda community in Rwanda. Gacaca, an intricate system of
customs and traditions that starts at community level, derives its
name from a grass called Urucaca that thrives well in homesteads.
The mechanism is founded on dialogue, reconciliation and
reparation. Whenever there is a feud between two or more parties,
elders gather in front of the homestead amidst Urucaca. Each party
is then asked to present their case. The role of the council of
elders is to facilitate the reconstruction of relationships.
Meanwhile the party in the wrong is required to pay a fine as a
way of punishment. Soon after, beer is shared by both parties and
the council of elders, followed by a feast.''
*''In Botswana, traditional courts form a critical part of the justice system, Judge Elijah Legwaila, President of Botswana's
Industrial Court, told participants in the inter-faith summit.
Traditional dispute resolution, principally aimed at preventing
the rupture of relationships, in addition to rectifying the wrong,
begins at the family level. In cases where disputes cannot be
dealt with at that level, they are referred to the ward Kgotla, a
localized court in the vicinity of the defendant's home.
Throughout the process, the defendant's kinsmen are actively
involved. If the matter cannot be resolved at the ward Kgotla,
then it goes to the main Kgotla, which is presided over by the
chief. Mokgwa le Molao, the legal system in this context,
literally means &quot;law and custom,&quot; and expresses the character of a
system of law that prescribes a moral content.''
*''In modern Rwanda, Gacaca is used as an institution to find out the truth about the 1994 genocide. The country's special genocide
courts have tried less than six percent of those detained for
suspected genocide offences. There are some 110,000 Rwandese in
the country's detention facilities, the vast majority of them
still awaiting trial. The Gacaca system currently works as a
tribunal, having been embraced by the community and the law. Late
last year, 260,000 adults of &quot;integrity, honesty and good conduct&quot;
were selected by local communities to serve as magistrates on the
more than 10,000 Gacaca tribunals.''
*''ho‘oponopono'' - Hawaiian, a mediation session among a family in which all discussion is directed towards a leader that attempts reconciliation (Note: the word ''wiki'' is originally Hawaiian)
*''mogaji'', the lineage head, and the ''baale'', an elderly head of the district, act as mediators among the Yoruba  They apparently use blackmail and the threat of excommunication to achieve a compromise
*''So Da Bee'' - title of a Yoruba television show in which disputes are solved
*The ancient Indian system of ''Panchayat'' involved a mediator (''pancha''), whose decisions were irreversible
*''In early Irish law, a brithem, who had trained in law but had not been appointed by the king as the official judge, could work as an arbitrator. The law established the arbitrator’s pay at one-twelfth of the sum at issue.''
*Old Testament - King Solomon
*''Jewish tradition, based on the Torah and Talmud, provided a judicial setting called Beth Din in which disputants argued their case before three rabbinical judges. The disputants first had to agree to be bound by the judges’ decision. Prior to appearing before the judges, the disputants were strongly urged to resolve their differences informally in bitzua(mediation) or p’sharah (arbitration)''
*''From the earliest days of Islam, Muhammad (570?–632) encouraged and practiced tahkim, or arbitration, to resolve a variety of disputes. Muhammad’s role as arbitrator is sanctioned by revelation. Once Islam became dominant in a community, local law was amended to include arbitration (Moussalli, 1997). ''
*''The Islamic tradition and culture focuses more on the group or community than on the individual. Originating in ancient Middle Eastern tribes and villages were the dispute resolution practices of Sulh(settlement) and Musalaha (reconciliation). The two together, often referred to simply as Sulh, have been used to control conflict and maintain harmony within and between tightly knit social groups. The ritual practices involve conversations, information sharing, and exchanging promises about the future. ''
*''The Acholi's Mato-Oput ritual involves the appearance of an individual or group of people involved in a conflict before a
council of elders (Lotido-Apoka)... Mato-Oput is
usually performed after a fight, disagreement or any rift that
would affect harmonious coexistence in the society. Where arms are
involved, a ceremony known as &quot;bending of spears&quot; is performed.
This involves the exchange of spears between the warring parties
and the bending of the tips of the same. From then on, all the
parties must vow not to harm one another, since they are united by
the ritual and therefore rendered brothers and sisters.''
*It'd be neat to have a name based on one of these traditional terms related to dispute resolution - Wikike, Wikubuntu, Wikipono, Wikisolomon, Wikipancha, Wikibrithem, Wikitakhem, Wikioput
*Other Ideas: Wikisummit, Wikiforum (I believe it's taken)
*Some words to replace ''Issue Guide'' as a namespace and a specific part of the project: Disputarium or Disputorium

:I rather like the idea of using some kind of traditional dispute resolution, since our goal after all is to facilitate communication among people who disagree with each other so that everyone can hopefully come to an amicable, informed and conscientious position.  Of these, Wikubuntu is nice.  From the Zulu word ''ubuntu'' which I have found defined as ''an attitude of togetherness in spirit and humanness'', ''humanity to others'', ''humanness'' and ''I am what I am because of who we all are''.  It is also apparently the name of a Linux distribution.  It ''serves as the spiritual foundation of African societies. It is a unifying vision or world view enshrined in the Zulu maxim ''umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu'', i.e. ''a person is a person through other persons'' (Shutte, 1993:46). At bottom, this traditional African aphorism articulates a basic respect and compassion for others. It can be interpreted as both a factual description and a rule of conduct or social ethic. It both describes human being as &quot;being-with-others&quot; and prescribes what &quot;being-with-others&quot; should be all about.''  Later, ''Ubuntu underscores the importance of agreement or consensus. African traditional culture, it seems, has an almost infinite capacity for the pursuit of consensus and reconciliation (Teffo, 1994a:4). Democracy the African way does not simply boil down to majority rule. Traditional African democracy operates in the form of (sometimes extremely lengthy) discussions (cf. Busia, 1967:28). Although there may be a hierarchy of importance among the speakers, every person gets an equal chance to speak up until some kind of an agreement, consensus or group cohesion is reached. This important aim is expressed by words like simunye (&quot;we are one&quot;, i.e. &quot;unity is strength&quot;) and slogans like &quot;an injury to one is an injury to all&quot; (Broodryk, 1997a:5, 7, 9).''  Also, ''Ubuntu inspires us to expose ourselves to others, to encounter the difference of their humanness so as to inform and enrich our own (cf. Sidane, 1994:8-9). Thus understood, ''umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu'' translates as: &quot;To be human is to affirm one's humanity by recognising the humanity of others in its infinite variety of content and form&quot; (Van der Merwe, 1996:1). This translation of Ubuntu attests to a respect for particularity, individuality and historicality, without which decolonization cannot be.'' and ''The Ubuntu respect for the particularities of the beliefs and practices of others (cf. also Wiredu, 1995), is especially emphasised by a striking, yet (to my mind) lesser-known translation of ''umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu'', viz.: &quot;A human being is a human being through (the otherness of) other human beings&quot; (Van der Merwe, 1996:1— italics mine). For post-apartheid South Africans of all colours, creeds and cultures, Ubuntu dictates that, if we were to be human, we need to recognise the genuine otherness of our fellow citizens.''  ''Ubuntu's respect for the particularity of the other, links up closely to its respect for individuality'' and ''Ubuntu defines the individual in terms of his/her relationship with others (Shutte, 1993:46ff). According to this definition, individuals only exist in  their relationships with others, and as these relationships change, so do the characters of the individuals. Thus understood, the word &quot;individual&quot; signifies a plurality of personalities corresponding to the multiplicity of relationships in which the individual in question stands. Being an individual by definition means &quot;being-with-others&quot;. &quot;With-others&quot;, as Macquarrie rightly observes, &quot;...is not added on to a pre-existent and self-sufficient being; rather, both this being (the self) and the others find themselves in a whole wherein they are already related&quot; (1972:104). '' (Much of the previous from [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Afri/AfriLouw.htm]).
::So... I kind of like Wikubuntu, though it is weird-looking and kind of difficult to pronounce.  Anyone know how ''ubuntu'' is pronounced in Zulu? [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 03:45, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Campaigns.wikia.com ==

On July 4th, Jimmy Wales launched [http://campaigns.wikia.com Campaigns Wikia] at Wikia.com, and it seems to dovetail with this Voter's Guide project.  I'd like to propose that much of the content here be moved to that site.  It might be useful to have a wikibook describing how to vote in general terms, but getting down to candidate names and specific initiatives and levies that might be on a ballot somewhere seems to be beyond the scope of the Wikipedia Foundation.  [[User:Chadlupkes|Chadlupkes]] 21:21, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

:While this may be considered a gentle suggestion that it is, this should not be considered as rationale for a VfD of this book.  Unfortunately, any effort that may have been put into this Wikibook may have in fact been zapped by this alternative Wiki.  Some of the voter's guides that have been generated here are of some significant value, and this is not necessarily outside of the scope of Wikibook.... provided it is NPOV and you can cite sources for the information that is being presented.  BTW, what exactly is &quot;outside the scope of the Wikipedia Foundation&quot;?  I didn't even know there was a Wikipedia Foundation.  The ''Wikimedia Foundation'' does try to set the scope of some projects, but I don't know of anything explicitly wrong here unless the WMF board itself is explicitly endorsing and providing financial or other support (like hosting an advocacy website) for a political candidate.  That is outside of the scope of this book and against Wikibooks policies as well like [[WB:WIW]].  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:11, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

::To be fair, Erik has used the term &quot;Wikipedia foundation&quot; frequently enough on foundation-l to create more then a little bit of confusion. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:12, 25 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''An Introduction to Canada'''
[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|350px|thumbnail|Click through for an animated map of changes to Canada's provincial boundaries.]]

Canada is a land of vast distances and rich natural resources.  Canada was founded in 1867 and retains ties to the United Kingdom through the Commonwealth agreement.  Canada has strong historic ties with both France and the United Kingdom and has traditionally supported and sided with these nations during international conflicts.  Recently however, Canada tends to side with the United States of America when international issues arise.  Such a relationship with the United States results from the strong economic ties between these two neighboring nations.

Major social and political issues within the nation include funding of the armed forces, taxation levels, healthcare and education funding and the relationship between the province of Quebec, known nationwide for its uneasy political relationship with the federal government.

== 2014 elections ==
The next election in the United States will be the biennial election for Senators (one third are up for election) and all Representatives. The next Presidential election will occur in 2016.

The last election in the United States was the [[Voter's Guide/United States/U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential elections]]. The race attracted attention world-wide.

Here are some guides to the issues likely to be of importance to voters in forthcoming elections.

===Operating System (OS) Programming===

A computer is a series of electrical pathways some of which can be changed by use of some of its own electrical pathways.

A computer instruction is a series of electrical signals that make use of a computer.

A computer program is a series of computer instructions.

An operating system (OS) is a computer program with the purposes of:

*allowing user input in its operation

*maintaining itself

*switching computer operation to other computer programs (tasks)

*maintaining other computer programs (tasks)

*controlling hardware

*allocating memory to software as needed

'''OS programming is''' ...
----

Many people are dissatisfied with currently-available operating systems, and research ways to improve them -- or introduce entirely new replacements.

Some [[Wikiversity:Computer Engineering|computer engineers]] develop entirely new computing hardware, and need to write a new OS for it (typically by adapting parts of some pre-existing OS).

&gt;&gt; There is no requirement to write E-mail addresses in format &quot;Name &lt;email&gt;&quot;, you can just write &quot;email&quot;.

Actually, there is, it's in the standard. Many SMTP servers will refuse to send your email if you do not put addresses in angle brackets. &quot;Name&quot; is optional, though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A running example from the 2004 American Presidential Race follows.  It should be clear that the choice of poll and who is leading is irrelevant to the presentation of the concepts.  According to an October 2nd Poll by [[Wikipedia:Newsweek|Newsweek]] ([http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/ link]), 47% of 1,013 registered [[Wikipedia:voters|voters]] would vote for [[Wikipedia:John Kerry|John Kerry]]/[[Wikipedia:John Edwards|John Edwards]] if the election were held today.  45% would vote for [[Wikipedia:George Bush|George Bush]]/[[Wikipedia:Dick Cheney|Dick Cheney]], and 2% would vote for [[Wikipedia:Ralph Nader|Ralph Nader]]/[[Wikipedia:Peter Camejo|Peter Camejo]].

*Open a new Blank Workbook in the program [[Wikipedia:Microsoft Excel|Microsoft Excel]].
*Enter Kerry's reported percentage ''p'' in cell A1 (0.47).
*Enter Bush's reported percentage ''q'' in cell B1 (0.45).
*Enter the number of respondents ''N'' in cell C1 (1013).  This can be found in most responsible reports on polls.
*In cell A2, copy and paste the next line of text in its entirety and press Enter.  This is the Microsoft Excel expression of the standard error of the difference as shown [[Wikipedia:Margin of error#Comparing percentages: the probability of leading|above]].

::=sqrt(A1*(1-A1)/C1+B1*(1-B1)/C1+2*A1*B1/C1)

*In cell A3, copy and paste the next line of text in its entirety and press Enter.  This is the Microsoft Excel expression of the probability that Kerry is leading based on the [[Wikipedia:normal distribution|normal distribution]] given the logic [[Wikipedia:Margin of error#Comparing percentages: the probability of leading|here]].  

::=normdist((A1-B1),0,A2,1)

*Don't forget that the percentages will be in decimal form.  The percentage will be 0.5, or 50% if A1 and B1 are the same, of course.

The above text might be enough to do the necessary calculation, it doesn't contribute to the understanding of the statistical test involved. Much too often people think statistics is a matter of calculation with complex formulas. 

So here is the problem:
Let p be the population fraction of the registered voters who vote for Kerry  and q likewise for Bush. In a poll n = 1013 respondents are asked to state their choice. A number of K respondents says to choose Kerry, a number B says to vote for Bush. K and B are random variables. The observed values for K and B are resp. k and b (numbers). So k/n is an estimate of p and b/n an estimate of q. The random variables K and B follow a trinomial distribution with parameters n, p, q and 1-p-q. Will Kerry be ahead of Bush? That is to say: wiil p &gt; q? To investigate this we perform a statistical test, with null hypothesis:
:&lt;math&gt;\, H_0: p = q&lt;/math&gt;
against the alternative
:&lt;math&gt;\, H_1: p &gt; q&lt;/math&gt;.

What is an appropriate test statistic T? We take:

:&lt;math&gt;\, T=K-B&lt;/math&gt;.

(In the above calculation &lt;math&gt;T=\frac Kn - \frac Bn = \frac{K-B}n&lt;/math&gt; is taken, which leads to the same calculation.)

We have to state the distribution of T under the null hypothesis. We may assume T is approximately normally distributed.

It is quite obvious that its expectation under H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\, E_0T = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Its variance under H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not as obvious. 

:&lt;math&gt;\, var_0(T) = var(K-B) = var(K) + var(B) - 2cov(K,B) = np(1-p) + nq(1-q) + 2npq &lt;/math&gt;.

We approximate the variance by using the sample fractions instead of the population fractions:

:&lt;math&gt;var_0(T) \approx 1013\times 0.47(1-0,46) + 1013\times 0.45(1-0.45) + 2\times 1013\times 0,47\times0.45 \approx 931
&lt;/math&gt;.
The standard deviation s will approximately be:

:&lt;math&gt;\, s = \sqrt{var_0(T)} \approx \sqrt{931} = 30.5 &lt;/math&gt;.

In the  sample we have found a value t = k - b = (0.47-0.45)1013 = 20.26 for T.
We will reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative for large values of T. So the question is: is 20.26 to be considered a large value for T? The criterion will be the so called p-value of this outcome:

:&lt;math&gt;\, p-value = P(T\ge t; H_0) = P(T\ge 20.26; H_0) = P(Z\ge \frac{20.26}{30.5}) = 1-\Phi(0.67) = 0.25&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a very large p-value, so there is no reason whatsoever to reject the null hypothesis.

{{split}}

At the time of this era, the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems runs the vast majority of the world's home computers. How did Windows rapidly become the dominant operating system for home use on the planet?

==History==
Microsoft Windows began as a GUI add-on to DOS. The early versions of Windows required DOS to be installed first. The first version that did not require DOS to be pre-installed was Windows 95. Early on, Windows split into two branches - the DOS-based branch and the NT based branch. Today, The DOS-based branch has been discontinued due to bugs (errors in software), Lack of hardware support, and instability. All versions of Windows since Windows NT 3.1 (these are Windows NT 3.1, NT 4.0, Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, and 8) are NT based.

===Predecessors===
Here are the predecessors to Microsoft Windows 95 in the order of release:

Windows 1.0

Windows 2.0

Windows 2.1 (Windows/286 and Windows/386)

Windows 3.0

Windows 3.1 (with a respective Windows for Workgroups release)

Windows 3.11 (also with a respective Windows for Workgroups release)

Windows 3.2 (a minor update to 3.1 for Simplified Chinese support)

====CP/M====
The CP/M Operating System, first written by Gary Kildall in PL/M, a language of his own invention, in 1975. It was written for the Intel 8080 CPU, which was the power behind such legendary machines as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI 8080, one of which was used in the movie 'War Games'. The system was very popular among those early computer users, and saw the introduction of many new devices, such as the 5 1/4&quot; floppy disk drive and the hard disk drive. In 1980, when IBM was building its first PC, they went to Gary Kindall, who didn't think the system would take off. It might interest you to know that one or two years later, the CP/M-86 OS was released independently of IBM, and cost about ten times what the then-new MS-DOS system did. Initially CP/M had many advanced features that MS-DOS did not have. However, because Gary did not want break off from his licensed based distribution of CP/M rather than accepting the OEM based distribution IBM wanted, Microsoft's MS-DOS was chosen to be the choice on the IBM PC. In addition to this, many of CP/M's features, such as multi-level directories and hard drive support, were not really thought of as needed.

====DOS====
DOS stands for Disk Operating System. A product called MSDOS was released by Microsoft in 1981 for the IBM Personal Computer. It offered file system access to FAT partitions and had tools for editing, programming, and management.
Later versions would support a semi-graphical navigator, and the ability to mount remote shares.
MSDOS had an long-lasting effect on the computer world, a very scaled down version of MSDOS was present in every Windows OS including the recent Windows vista (and the Windows NT Operating Systems, Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,and Windows XP).

====OS/2====
New Key Features:
Overlapped windows and icons 
Windows 2.0 came with the ability to let windows and icons are overlapped. Windows can be freely resized and moved in the screen. 
386 enhanced mode to take advantage of memory larger than 640K 
There are two versions of windows 2.0. The first version of windows 2.0 was called Windows/286 later after Microsoft release windows 2.0 with support of 386 enhance mode, which is called Windows/386. The 386 enhanced mode gave the system capability to run multiple MS-DOS applications simultaneously in extended memory.

===Inception===
Microsoft was not the first company to investigate the use of a Graphical User Interface, or GUI, to control a personal computer. That distinction belongs to the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). Xerox demonstrated seven key ideas whose strategic importance were immediately apparent to both Microsoft and Apple, and critical to the success of both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1. The use of a windowing system to give a user common presentation and operation of different applications,&lt;br&gt;
2. The concept and use of a mouse to navigate that system,&lt;br&gt;
3. A clear demonstration that multitasking (running several applications at the same time) could actually be useful to home and business users,&lt;br&gt;
4. The demonstration of a laser printer, which significantly increased the potential for desktop publishing,&lt;br&gt;
5. That a computer could potentially be used by an operator with little or no training,&lt;br&gt;
6. That such an operator, once familiarized with the system, would be strongly opposed to moving back to a more complicated environment,&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
7. That such a computer could be networked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The impact of that final idea took a long time to be fully realized- Windows certainly did not embrace it, or even support it, initially- but the whole package really was demonstrated that long ago.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Why Xerox wasn't able to capitalize on its own strokes of genius would be (and, indeed, is) another book, in and of itself.

===16-Bit Versions===
Most Personal Computers are using Intel X86 instruction sets. As long as they are using the same instruction sets, they can perform the same job. That is, 286, 386, 486, Pentium and many other types of processors are equally well. The only differences between them are the speed, and memory addressing capability. Although 086 and 286 are using the same X86 instruction set, however, because of having some troubles on addressing the high memory, therefore, many programs are not able the run on these older processors.
====Windows 3.0 - 3.1====
386 Enhanced mode implemented all the benefits of Standard mode, plus 32-bit addressing and paging for faster memory access, and virtual 8086 mode for safer execution of MS-DOS programs: each of them now ran in a virtual machine. In the previous modes, multiple MS-DOS programs could only be run in full-screen, and only the program currently active was executing; but in 386 enhanced mode, they could be run simultaneously in separate windows. This mode required a 386 processor and 1 MB of extended memory (in addition to the base 640KB) – beyond the specifications of most PCs sold in 1990.

====Windows for Workgroups====
A Winsock package was required to support TCP/IP networking in Windows 3.x. Usually third-party packages were used, but in August 1994, Microsoft released an add-on package (codenamed Wolverine) that provided TCP/IP support in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Wolverine was a 32-bit stack (accessible from 16-bit Windows application via WinSock thunks), which gave it superior performance to most of the third-party TCP/IP Windows stacks available. However, it was only compatible with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and lacked support for dial-up. The Wolverine stack was an early version of the TCP/IP stack that would later ship with Windows 95, and provided an early testbed for the 16-to-32-bit compatibility layer that was crucial to Windows 95's success.

===32-Bit Versions===
The increased address-space size in 32-bit Windows impacts 16-bit code in several ways: 
•Pointers are all 32 bits wide and are no longer near or far, and your code cannot make assumptions based on segmented memory.
•Window handles, handles to other objects (such as pens, brushes, and menus), and graphics coordinates have increased to 32 bits. Thus, you cannot use types such as WORD interchangeably with HWND as you could in 16-bit Windows.
•Message handlers must be rewritten because the different sizes can change the way information is packed in some message parameters.
•The larger size of graphics coordinates affects a number of function calls.
The key areas of 16-bit code affected by these changes are: 
•Window procedure declarations
•Near and far type declarations
•Data types
•Messages
•Calls to API functions
•WinMain function
For a thorough discussion of 32-bit adaptations in each of these areas, see Porting 16-Bit Code to 32-Bit Windows.

====Windows NT====
MS-DOS and all previous versions of Windows were single-user systems. NT, however, supports multiprogramming, so several users can work on the same machine at the same time. For example, a network server may have multiple users logged in simultaneously over a network, each accessing its own files in a protected way.

====Windows 95====
The first 32-bit Operating System in the Windows Family outside of Windows NT. But still, it is easier to crash than Windows NT (but harder to crash than Windows 3.1), and relative to Windows NT, not very stable. This project has been abandoned years ago.

====Windows 98====
In computing, the Windows Driver Model (WDM) — also known at one point as the Win32 Driver Model — is a framework for device drivers that was introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to replace VxD, which was used on older versions of Windows such as Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, as well as the Windows NT Driver Model.

====Windows 98 SE====
Windows 98 SE (Second Edition) included DVD support)

====Windows 2000====
This version of Microsoft Windows preceded Windows XP. Its core functionality is very similar, but it lacks some of the features later added to XP. Many continue to use 2000 instead of XP, because they believe the extra XP features are unnecessary and cause the computer to run slower. Windows 2000 is the final NT-based system without activation.

====Windows Me====
[[Image:98litedos.png|160px|thumb|right|DOS 8.00]]
Windows Millennium Edition was meant to bring an end to the 95/DOS line of OS's, although it still contains DOS 8.00. It sported new features in the multimedia area, such as Windows Movie Maker 1.0 and Windows Media Player 7. It also had other important new features such as System Restore. Most of the new features were continued into Windows XP making XP what it is. Windows Me is the final DOS-based system without activation.

====Windows XP====
Windows XP was originally released in year 2001. It included improved graphics, and a more user-friendly environment. Windows XP was built on the core of Windows 2000 but adds greater stability for most desktop users plus a fancier graphical user interface. Although the goal of perfect security continues to elude the OS, Service Pack 2 (SP2) improves matters over the original release and rolls up enhancements added between release and mid-2004.

====Windows 2003 Server/Advanced Server====
Windows Server 2003 (sometimes referred to as Win2K3) is a server operating system produced by Microsoft, introduced on 24 April 2003. An updated version, Windows Server 2003 R2, was released to manufacturing on 6 December 2005. Its successor, Windows Server 2008, was released on 4 February 2008. According to Microsoft, Windows Server 2003 is more scalable and delivers better performance than its predecessor, Windows 2000.

===64-Bit Versions===
There is currently support for the 64-bit Intel Itanium processor in Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and Datacenter editions, supporting up to 64 Itanium CPUs in the later. Windows Server 2003 SP1 adds x64 support. Note: Source update under this version will be suffixed by &quot;IA64&quot;, there is the difference from the usual Intel/AMD architecture of &quot;x64&quot; bit sources.

Note also that there are computers based on the 64-bit IBM Power chips that are used in the G5 Macintosh computers that are running the Windows NT kernel. These &quot;Macs running Windows&quot; are used for game development on the future generation Xbox that will use IBM Power CPUs.

(explain existing 64-bit CPUs- AMD, Intel, etc.)

====Windows Vista====
This version of Microsoft Windows, released on January 2007, is the latest major upgrade for the Windows operating system.

Until the product name was revealed in July 2005, Windows Vista was known as 'Codename Longhorn'.

It includes major changes graphically. Translucency and other visual effects are highly used. Also, applications are now switching over to the .NET framework. (Add something more about core like avalon, and GUI)

====Windows Server 2008 Systems====
With this introduction of Microsoft Windows Servers, released on October 2008, it contains the same code base as Vista (Windows6.0). Its significant change and added feature set is enabling the virtualization of Microsoft Windows Server Systems. The support from 32-bit Windows 2000, Windows 2003, 2003 R2 and Windows 2008 itself, plus the associated existing 64-bit version will expect to become the enabler of any enterprise system, large, medium or small to harness the use and simplicity of virtualized Windows systems (including some flavors of Linux) to meet everyday needs of computing.

===Design Goals===
A main design goal of Windows was hardware and software portability.

==Installation==
This chapter will explain how to install Windows. Since installation is fairly similar between versions- with important, and sometimes subtle, differences- we will example how to install Windows XP, Home Edition, and then review the differences for other versions. This chapter explains only the basics; once you're up and running, check out the Configuration chapter to personalize your system.

Make sure that whatever you are installing, that you have a copy of the files you need stored in a safe place, even if it's on a separate partition. You're generally better off wiping the partition with your old operating system so as to remove all the incompatible files, viruses, spyware and general clutter/temp files that all computers accrue over their lives. 

===Installing Windows XP, Home Edition===
Depends if you install from booting a CD or from running the setup program from another version of Windows. It's better to boot from the disk, this way you can alter your partitions before you install whereas otherwise you may find yourself being forced to install it over an old copy.

===Differences for Windows XP Professional===
Adds greater networking and enterprise features. If you have a network, this is the version you need..

===Differences for Windows MCE base-2004-2005===
Windows XP Media Center Edition is distinguished from other editions of Windows XP by an exclusive preinstalled application, Media Center, which provides a large-font (&quot;10-foot&quot;), remotely accessible interface for TV viewing on the computer as well as recording and playback, DVD playback, video playback, photo viewing, and music playback.

==Configuration==
The Windows configuration was always meant to be user-friendly to office support and home, although some Windows Operating Systems and editions were meant to mean one thing or another.
===Basic Configuration===
(how to set the machine name, time, etc.; NOT networking)

===Appearance and Environment===
For Windows Classic, you will normally follow this step to change the apperance, wallpaper, resolution, etc.:
In a desktop area (not on a window), right click. A menu will appear so you will click propertiys.

===Networking===
The workgroup is usually set up when the operating system is first installed. This choice can be edited from the network wizard later on. Once a computer has a network (basically before it's first boot) it can trade files with other computers on that network. 

(basic Workgroup and Domain configuration; NOT connection sharing, firewall stuff, etc.; that goes into Advanced Stuff)

===Printers===
(needs to be below networking because this should explain network printers; explain how to add a printer; how to change the default printer; how to change the printing defaults; when to choose PCL vs. PS when printer offers both; parallel vs. USB vs serial vs. network; explain FAX send can be a printing device, etc.)

===Accessibility===
Both Windows XP and Windows Vista include options for those with difficulty reading or using a computer(Color-blind etc). They are found under: Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Accessibility. 

(handicapped access; explain Magnifier, text-to-speech, voice recognition, etc., including a -brief- discussion of third-party options)

===Electronic Mail===

====Outlook Express====
By default, Microsoft Windows includes &lt;b&gt;Outlook Express&lt;/b&gt; to allow access to electronic mail.&lt;br&gt;

Note: for Windows Vista/7, there's Windows Mail instead of Outlook Express

====Mozilla Thunderbird====
A rather more secure e-mail program than Outlook Express and works almost exactly the same. &lt;br&gt;
Further details: http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/

==Using Windows==

Windows comes with a variety of software including Paint(A basic image editing program), Notepad(A simple text editor) and in later versions: Word, Internet Explorer, Outlook Express or Windows Mail and so on. A great variety of freeware, shareware and commercial packages are available.

===Basic Operation===
Most computers come pre-installed with an OS called Microsoft® Windows®. Most OS's and programs have the same features whether they use Windows or not, but all computers running Windows will have these features with these names. The thing we did in the last chapter with the box that comes up when you turn on your computer is called logging in. The screen you see after logging in is called the Desktop. Most things on a computer are named after things in real life, and they are usually used similarly too. Just like a real desktop the desktop on a computer is where you go to access all your data. However, a real desktop has a flat horizontal surface.

===Screenshots===
A [[w:screenshot|screenshot]] of the entire monitor, complete with [[w:taskbar|taskbar]], can be copied to the system [[w:Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] by pressing the &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Print screen|Print screen]]&lt;/tt&gt; key. Alternatively, pressing &lt;tt&gt;[Alt + Print screen&lt;/tt&gt; will copy just the [[w:active window|active window]] to the [[w:clipboard|clipboard]]. One can then paste the clipboard into a program such as [[w:MS Paint|MS Paint]] or [[w:Paint.NET|Paint.NET]] to save it as an image file (for posting online, for instance), or paste it directly into a document. If saving as an image file, it is best to use a format which uses lossless compression (e.g. [[w:PNG|PNG]]) or no compression (e.g. BMP). Use a format which supports 24-bit color if the screenshot contains many colors.

==Optimizing Performance==
Some people say that the various &quot;tweaks&quot; one can apply to the system never improve the performance significantly, certainly not enough to justify the hours and hours that some people spend experimentally tweaking.

The problem is that the effects of many tweaks are a bit iffy. There are some programs that work and some tweaks that, while they have an effect, are not something that you are likely to notice. Generally the Internet Speed tweaks and XPLite programs are worth using. Beyond that though, don't bother. If things like the appearance settings and NTFS Last Access Stamp tweaks noticeably improve your speed then you would be better off running either Win98SE or Linux, conversely they all have some effect and removing unneeded features does help.

Some people say that many &quot;tweaks&quot; are well worth doing.

There are lots of things you can do to improve performance. Defragment the disk, turn off services you don't need - Google for a list - restart Firefox regularly (if you use it) since it's a memory hog...

Ways to increase performance include: defragmenting the hard disk, disabling unneeded visual effects, upgrading the amount of RAM in the computer, and using various utilities and programs available for download or purchase.

If the intent is simply to improve the speed at which the system runs, regardless of all other considerations, then the ultimate speed improvement is achieved by uninstalling Windows XP, and installing Windows 98SE or Windows ME instead, since those versions of Windows are only half the size of Windows XP, so they subjectively run twice as fast as XP on any given CPU.

===General Tips===
Several programs work for almost all Windows versions. 

[http://www.x-setup.net/ X-setup] Excellent commercial tweaking program for Win9x/ME and WinXP/Vista/7, comes well recommended. &lt;br&gt;
[http://www.majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=4194 DH TuneXP] Free WinXP tweaker program, has useful tweaks.&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.speedguide.net/downloads.php SG TCP/IP Optimizer] Use this for fast internet tweaking.
[http://www.cfos.de/index2_e.htm cFos Homepage (English)] Get the packet shaping software from here.&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.litepc.com XpLite] Very useful in removing parts of Windows 2000 and XP systems. &lt;br&gt; 
[http://nuhi.msfn.org/ Nlite] Fulfils the same function as XpLite but instead works on a Windows XP CD image, which is then transformed into a bootable CD. This program is freeware and more versatile than XpLite.&lt;br&gt;

===Processor Scheduling===
When using Windows 2000 and XP there is an option to retry your operating system allocates processing power to programs. this is governed by registry entry called Win32PrioritySeparation and the values for this are allocated as follows...

Start with zero and add numbers as follows

The ratio of foreground to background priority

''3:1, add 2.&lt;br&gt;''
''2:1, add 1.&lt;br&gt;''
''1:1, add 0.&lt;br&gt;'' 

Length of the quanta

''Variable lengths: add 4.&lt;br&gt;''
''Fixed lengths: add 8.&lt;br&gt;'' 

Te intervals between switching quanta.

''Shorter: add 32.&lt;br&gt;''
''Longer: add 16.&lt;br&gt;'' 

By default it is set to &quot;2&quot; which is equal to &quot;38&quot;, setting it to background processes sets it to &quot;24&quot;. Note that this value is in decimal. Personally I use a value of &quot;36&quot; for the best all-around benefit. This value allows all programs to work seamlessly even at 100% processor usage; mind you this is on a P4 so your mileage may vary.

===Internet Speed===
Generally optimizing an Internet connection involves tweaking the MTU (maximum transmission unit)and the receive window. The MTU controls how much data is in every download packet, larger settings improve efficiency by reducing overhead and require fewer acknowledgement packets. The receive window sets how much data is to be received before needing to send an acknowledgement packet, this setting does not need to be a multiple of the MTU and should be as large as reasonably possible.

It would also be worth the time to set up a packet scheduler. Generally doing heavy uploading and downloading at the same time would slow down your connection, with a a packet scheduler this is less of an issue. Additionally, some packet schedulers like cFosSpeed allow for prioritizing specific programs like games over more bandwidth intensive but less interactive applications like FTP clients.

===Trimming the OS===
Litepc creates software to trim operating systems. Removing unused parts of the OS is beneficial in several ways. It reduces the amount of disk space that the OS takes up, removes possible security issues and results in less of a RAM hit. XPLite allows for currently installed operating system to be altered while NLite (as previously mentioned) does the same to a CD image. XPLite leaves corrupted registry entries and is less versatile than Nlite.

===Side Note===
On a final note it is important to know what any changes actually do, besides &quot;provides speed boost&quot; and how they affect your computer. I have had many incidents where the accruation of &quot;tweaks&quot; served to slow the computer down. Don't rely on being able to undo them with the program.

===Windows CE===
Consumer edition of windows. Used with consumer electronics. Most notably used with the revolutionary Sega Dreamcast video game console.
Windows CE is also used on many Pocket PCs and Smart Phones. The newest ist Windows CE 6.0, released in 2007.

===Windows 9x===

===Windows XP / 2000 / Server 2003===
Beforehand it should be noted that 2000 is often acknowledged to provide better performance with real world use (Several programs running at the same time). It lacks some of the features of XP including the themes but is essentially the same and uses the same drivers.

There are some tweaks that do not require specialized software.

Control Panel&gt;System
Advanced&gt;Performance Settings&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Disabling features will reduce the overhead on any action and some users can notice significant performance benefits from deselecting everything. Font smoothing, especially if using ClearType, will depend heavily on the graphics card, disabling it may have a significant effect.

====Paging File====
There are plenty of recommendations on this, the one that makes the most sense is to set the minimum to cover normal system use like 256 or 512 MB which will not require it to change in size while in general use but to set the maximum much higher to cover contingencies. The default will work fine in most cases, note that setting the minimum higher will result in paging file fragmentation, which is very hard to fix and if succeeded, will give a speed hit. An average user might be able to download and use [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Utilities/PageDefrag.mspx PageDefrag] (from [http://technet.microsoft.com Microsoft TechNet] website under [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx Sysinternals]) to defragment paging file on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Server 2003.

====Cluster Size====
This represents the cluster size on a partition, generally bigger means less fragmentation as files expand and slightly higher disk speed as less data is spent on overhead, conversely it wastes space as each file takes up a minimum of one cluster. The default seems to do fine. Altering the cluster size on the partition with the Master Boot Record may cause problems. Also, the default cluster size (4KB on NTFS / Windows XP) allows the computer to transfer data without using extra buffering.

====Services.msc / Msconfig====
Run&gt;services.msc

Really there is no reason why anyone should bother with this section. Unless disabling security flaws removing services causes no end of interesting errors and will free up around 7-12MB.

One benefit to using services.msc to msconfig is that services can be set to manual. However most services will not properly start up, I recommend to use Run&gt;msconfig after identifying what services are necessary to disable them, they can also be restored to Windows default by clicking select all.

Services that are critical or that are needed and may not start otherwise should be set to Automatic while the oher Automatic services should be set to Manual. This will theoretically cause them to only start when needed (again, it should be noted that this is almost never true). Note that some services are set to disabled by default on Windows Server 2003, these are Windows Xp features that are generally not needed by a server, if they are required they must first be enabled at services.msc.

===Xsetup===

==== UDMA/66 ====
Hardware&gt;Hard Disk
This must be enabled on Windows 2000 as it is disabled by default. If your system is capable of UDMA/66, enable it, if the system is not capable then rebooting will untick the box.

==== Prefetching ====
System&gt;File system&gt;Windows Prefetching&lt;br&gt;
Windows prefetcher will monitor an application's startup sequence and Windows boot. After three application startups or three Windows boot ups, it creates a .PF file in the Windows Prefetch folder for the application or the associated boot item. This file is referenced anytime the application is launched but only when it is launched and NOT before. Windows uses the information in the applications's .PF file to optimally load the necessary files associated with the application loading into memory. Such as DLL A before B etc... Windows also uses this file when the defragmenter is run to layout all necessary files that the application uses to startup in sequence on the hard drive to further improve application load time. The same things happen during boot up but only in relation to files used for the boot process. Applications that are not loaded on startup are NOT precached or preloaded into Memory during boot. They are not precached at any time. This is NOT a cache and the .PF files should NOT be deleted or &quot;cleaned&quot;. Manually deleting .PF Files does nothing but force Windows to recreate the .PF file if it is missing the next time the associated application is launched. This is a waste of time. Simply leave the .PF files and the Prefetch folder alone. Windows will automatically clean it as necessary in relation to uninstalled applications. Prefetching is NOT Caching, it is a new feature of Windows that improves application load and boot time performance automatically.

==== File System ====
System&gt;File system&gt;Windows NT/2K/XP Options&gt;Windows File System Options&lt;br&gt;
These are generally useless features, note that disabling the last access time stamp can cause windows cleanup to have interesting ideas on what is useless data. Disabling the creation of short file names may cause issues in some programs as well as pretty much all programs written for dos. Conversely you are unlikely to use those programs and it will help when dealing with folders that have many files that start the same.

==== RAM ====
System&gt;Memory&lt;br&gt;
Unloading dll files instantly can cause system instability, conversely extra ram is always a good thing. Instability will only occur in very rare circumstances however if you start the same programs over and over this could be beneficial. This depends on how much ram you have though leaving it as it is may be the best choice.

Disabling paging will force the computer to keep more of the system in RAM. This will also prevent the computer from entering sleep mode. Windows will NEVER page the core kernel &amp; drivers (that would cause a crash) , however it is willing to page a part of it's systems. This setting causes more of the system to not be paged, probably won't help your game speed but if you run RAM heavy programs it will prove beneficial. Theory being that the programs will page but not the Windows core which should do less of a performance hit.

==== Cacheman ====
Just one setting, may improve performance, may do nothing. 

Settings&gt;Cache&lt;br&gt;
Set the bottom box to &quot;Balance&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It would be a good idea to stop Cacheman starting with Windows which you can do from the Options bar; it's worth noting here that &quot;RAM Recovery&quot; is generally agreed to be completely worthless, don't use it.&lt;br&gt;

===Windows CE===

====Ancient times====
Microsoft was trying to enter the PDA market years before the release of the first Windows-powered handhelds. First development initiatives happened as early as 1990. When Apple's Newton MessagePad emerged, Microsoft decided to begin development of the new OS.

The WinPad project would be a revolution in the user interface design. With the touch screen and handwriting recognition support, the project promised brand-new user experience. However, the mobile devices' hardware was not ready for such an operating system at that moment. The main fault of the developers was possibly the attempt to use portions of the existing kernel modules' code. The project was closed in 1994.

At the same time, Microsoft worked on the Pulsar project. The concept of a multi-purpose wire- and keyboardless device featuring unique architecture was too pathbreaking, and Microsoft discarded this idea as well.

(to be continued...)

(...and PocketPC... and Handheld PC... and so on... make some sense of this mess for the reader! this of all things is clear as MUD even to developers!)

And on 9th march 2006, MS has unveiled their UMPC..

===Windows XP Embedded===
Microsoft® Windows® XP Embedded is a componentized version of the Microsoft® Windows® XP Professional operating system that brings the rich feature set of Windows XP Professional to embedded devices. However, there are some differences between Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Embedded. The major difference is that Windows XP Embedded is engineered specifically to support embedded devices and their manufacturers. This document describes Windows XP Embedded solutions for common embedded scenarios, and describes Windows XP Professional features that Windows XP Embedded does not include.

==Microsoft's Development Cycle==
SDL Practice #1: 

Core Security Training

Software security training is a prerequisite for implementing the SDL, and individuals in technical roles (developers, testers, and program managers) who are directly involved with the development of software programs must attend at least one unique security training class each year. 

Why should I follow this practice?  
Understanding software security problems is a foundational part of building better software. By allowing individuals involved with the development of software programs to stay informed about security basics and latest trends in security and privacy, you’ll increase their commitment to writing more secure software. For more information, read the Essential Software Security Training for the Microsoft SDL whitepaper. 

When should I employ this practice?  
Basic software security training should cover foundational concepts such as: 

■Secure design, including: attack surface reduction, defense in depth, principle of least privilege, secure defaults

■Threat modeling, including: overview of threat modeling, design implications of a threat model, coding constraints based on a threat model

■Secure coding, including: buffer overruns (for applications using C and C++), integer arithmetic errors (for applications using C and C++), cross-site scripting (for managed code and web applications), SQL injection (for managed code and web applications), and weak cryptography

■Security testing, including: differences between security testing and functional testing, risk assessment, security testing methods

Privacy, including: types of privacy-sensitive data, privacy design best practices, risk assessment, privacy development best practices, and privacy testing best practices

==The Windows Version Lifecycle==
When a version is released, it is soon discovered that there are thousands of bugs (errors) and miscellaneous problems, especially security issues. This leads to a large stream of patches being released which sometimes get condensed into a service pack. As the program ages and newer systems are released the support will be discontinued so as to force users to upgrade.

More info here: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/lifecycle/default.mspx

(explain how a Windows version is serviced- Service Packs, Windows Update, etc- and finally obsoleted; explain how support options change and eventually evaporate)

==The Future==

===Windows Vienna===
See Wikipedia article [[w:Windows 7|Windows 7]].

==Appendix: Key combinations==

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

==Ingredients==
*6 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled and [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*3 cups water
*2 cubes [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|chicken bouillon]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste
*3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] [[Cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]]
*1 tbsp dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1/4 tsp dried [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]

==Procedure==
#Cook onion in butter until tender
#Bring the diced potatoes, carrots, water and chicken bouillon in another stock pot to a boil. Simmer about 10 minutes or until tender. Add ground black pepper.
#Add the flour to the cooked onions to make a paste. Stir in the milk. Cook over low heat stirring constantly until warmed through. Add the potato and carrot mixture. Stir in the parsley and thyme and heat through. Serve hot.

==Variations==
#Use vegetable [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] instead of chicken bouillon for a vegetarian soup.
#Add leeks if available.
#Omit all ingredients except potatoes, water, salt and pepper for a simple and surprisingly pleasing potato soup.  High quality, flavorful potatoes are required for this variation, which itself presents an ideal base for an inventive cook to expand upon.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The two most important aspects of any algorithm (except for perhaps correctness) is speed and memory consumption. How do you measure these? The most obvious way perhaps is to determine a function on the size of the input to determine speed. For instance, an algorithm can be found use 

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^2 + 3n + 14&lt;/math&gt;

units of time (in this discussion the main focus will be on speed, but it's the same for memory consumtion). Is this a good approach to determine speed of an algorithm. Yes and no. When to different algorithm is very similar in time consumption a clear-cut function might help to understand what algorithm is faster under what conditions. But in the majority of the cases this it is just to combersome to figure out an exact speed, especially in higher level languages. Conditions also vary wildly from system to system so there are never one definite function. So what do you use? What is really interesting here is not what the function is excactly but really how it grows. What does this then mean? Consider the two functions

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^3-12n^2+20n+110&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(n) = n^3+n^2+5n+5&lt;/math&gt;

They look quite different, but how do they behave? Let's look at a few plots of the function (f(n) is in red, g(n) in blue).

&lt;table border = 0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot1.png|frame|From 0 to 5|From 0 to 5]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot2.png|frame|From 0 to 15|From 0 to 15]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot3.png|frame|From 0 to 100|From 0 to 100]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Algorithms-Asymptotic-ExamplePlot4.png|frame|From 0 to 1000|From 0 to 1000]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In the first, very limited plot the curves appear somewhat different. In the second they start going in sort of the same way, in the third there is only a very small difference, and at last they are virtually identical. Infact they approach n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the dominant term. When n gets large, the other terms become minescule in comparison to n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

As you can see, if you want to improve an algorithms non-dominant terms, it doesn't change much. What really matters is the dominant term. This is why we adopt a new notation for this. We say that:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^3-12n^2+20n+110 = O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt;

We ignore the low-order terms. We can say that:

:&lt;math&gt;O(\log {x}) \le O(\sqrt{n}) \le O(n) \le O(n \log {n}) \le O(n^2) \le O(n^3) \le O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us a way to easily compare algorithms with eachother. Bubblesort sorts in &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Mergesort sorts in &lt;math&gt;O(n \log {n})&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore mergesort is faster than bubblesort.

'''Cheese''' is a dairy foodstuff made from the curdled [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] of various animals, most frequently cows, but often goats, sheep, and water buffalo.

Some cheeses are made with the addition of herbs and spices. In some locations as a response to the loss of diversity in mass-produced cheeses, a cottage industry has grown up around home cheesemaking.

'''Aged care''' emerged as an issue in the 2004 election in Australia when Opposition Leader Mark Latham announced and costed a policy for aged care, which was for the Government to take care of people over 75.

This has become an issue because the baby-boomers (the generation born from 1942 to 1967) will be in the senior age group, some of them in the next four years.

The policy for aged care included both public and private hospital care, as well as care for the elderly at home.

The person responsible for such a policy is the Minister for Health and the Minister for Aged Care.

'''Education''' was early an important issue in the 2004 Australian legislative election, when in January 2004, John Howard said, in effect, that there were no values in the public schools.

This invited backlash from schools and families, particularly those who go to Government schools.

Teachers of all education levels had strikes all through 2004.

The issue of how much funding to give non-Government schools heated up significantly during the election campaign. Mark Latham announced in the television debate that he would cut or freeze funding from non-Government schools like Kings' in Sydney that are in the SES 1 bracket of Government Funding to schools.

Higher education was important in the campaign too. The Liberals announced that they would fund students who took up a trade, and that they would build new technical schools of excellence. Labor said, however, that they would reduce the 25% HECS on university students, and create 12,000 TAFE and university places.

'''Truth in Government''' has been an ongoing issue ever since on August 29, John Howard announced that the 2004 election would be based on trust.

The Australian electorate tends to be very cynical about its politicians and the things they do, especially when it comes to keeping promises.

Forty-three former diplomats sent a petition to the Prime Minister about the war in Iraq. They felt that the Prime Minister was getting bad advice and making decisions which affected the issue of Truth in Government.

'''National security''' is an issue in the 2004 election on several fronts:  Australia's own borders, South-East Asia and the Middle East.

National security decisions are often, but not always, connected to the national interest.

The person who is responsible for taking National Security decisions is the Foreign Minister, with advice from the Prime Minister, public servants and diplomats who know the regions concerned well.

Hello,

thank you for adding a back link to one of our pages. Only we do have navigation templates ([[Template:Ada/Navigation 1]], [[Template:Ada/Navigation 2]], etc.) which realy should be used. See [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing]] for details.

== World History ==

Thanks, Alsocal!  I'd love your help, though I would like your concurrence that the AP World History Standard is superior to the California Standard (the standard used by the American state of California as the base curriculum for World History classes at the secondary level).  As you may gather from my talk page, a few months back I joined and &quot;saved&quot; it, as you say.  However, someone eventually returned and demanded that the California standard be reinstated (they never contacted me directly, only [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]], our ''de facto'' supervisor and head honcho).  On his/her behalf, Karl asked me to reinstate the California Standard or develop seperate projects based on the two, which I objected to.  Apparently this person claimed that they had a group of &quot;experts&quot; who wanted to help, but only under the California standard.  At this time, I became busy with issues in my life and left for a period.  Upon my return in late January 2005, I discovered that since my last contact with Karl, only a single minor edit had been made to the textbook in my elapsed period, so I guess this person was just making it up, as I suspected.  However, if you are this person I'd love to work with you!  Contact me at your leisure, --[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 02:06, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

There is a seperate textbook at [[COSTP World History Project]] based on the California standard, but it was created by Karl and has not had a single sentence of content since its creation almost two months ago.  As to the overlap- I don't really think so.  Anyway the difference is more philosophical than practical- honestly I don't think the California standard is anywhere near specific enough and almost 50% of the non-Western stuff is not even outlined,so I think it's silly not to put all our effort into the AP one- and I don't mean to focus on AP format, I just thought that many people who might eventually use the book would be AP teachers and maybe if they wanted to use it with their students that they would want an overview of the AP Exam.  Anyway, does this mean you would like to contribute?  I'd love to point out a place to start or you can just dive right in (that's what I would do-but it's up to you of course).  Hope you join me!--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:40, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Great!  I've got one thing to ask you- do you want to be added to the [[World History/The &quot;Staff&quot;]] page?  I don't want you to be a proofreader or something boring, because frankly I know I've put a bunch of typos in, I read them a lot, I just think we should get articles in.  So what do you want to do?  History's fun, but I must ask that you don't just reword from Wikipedia, if you have a book (or reliable website) about a topic you like, go right ahead!  I personnally would like you to work on medieval European history, because I abhor it (It'd probably be the last thing I'd write).  Anything you'd like to do is fine!--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:14, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

===Using [[US History|History of the United States]]===

I've started the Interwar Years chapter. As some of the content on the abovementioned book is relevant, is it OK to copy it in or at least summarise it? (in particular the wall st crash, New Deal etc.) We've studied this extensiely at school so I know a bit about this area anyway. Thanks [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 12:28, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

== Recipe navigation template ==

Hi, when you're adding navigation to a recipe, please use the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template. This will add the main Cookbook link, a link to the recipe index, and include the recipe in the &quot;Recipes&quot; category (a primitive attempt at getting a recipe index).

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian Cuisine]]



'''Tiramisù''' means &quot;pull me up&quot; in Italian and aptly describes this dessert traditionally made from [[Cookbook:Lady Finger Cookies (Savoiardi)|savoiardi]] or [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers|ladyfingers]], espresso coffee, mascarpone cheese, egg whites, sugar, and often marsala wine. The biscuits are sprinkled with strong coffee and the marsala, and then embedded in a thick rich custard. 


== Ingredients for 6-8 people ==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]
* 100 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup)]] of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or 5 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Fructose|fruit sugar]] (alter to your own preference)
* 500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (2 1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cups)]] of [[Cookbook:Mascarpone Cheese|mascarpone cheese]]
* 4 small coffee cups of [[Cookbook:Espresso|espresso]] [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee]]
* [[w:Marsala wine|marsala wine]] (or brandy or [[w:Cognac (drink)|cognac]])or Amaretto di sarono.
* 400 g of [[Cookbook:Lady Finger Cookies (Savoiardi)|savoiardi or lady fingers]] (sponge cake fingers)
* dark [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] powder
usualy a starch based biscuit is used; for the base, or sugar cookies;  may be used.

== Preparation ==

# Make espresso coffee, sweeten, and add the marsala wine (or cognac) to it. Let it cool a bit.
# Separate the egg yolks and the whites of two eggs in two bowls.
# Beat sugar into the egg yolks.
# Beat the mascarpone into the sweetened yolks.
# Add two more egg whites to the other two and whisk until they form stiff peaks.
# Fold gently egg whites into mascarpone mixture.
# Quickly dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture.
# Layer soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone in a large bowl or pan (start with fingers, finish with mascarpone).
# Sprinkle dark chocolate powder on top.
# Refrigerate for one hour.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* [[Cookbook:Lady Finger Cookies (Savoiardi)|Savoiardi]] are the traditional biscuits used with this recipe, rather than [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers|ladyfingers]]. [[Cookbook:Sponge Cake|Sponge cake]] can also be used.
* Cream can be used as an alternative to thicken the tiramisu. Whisk 3/4 pint to 1 pint of double cream until stiff peaks form, then add the sugar and continue from step 2.
* Full-fat spread cheese can be used as an alternative to mascarpone; add some cream to taste.
* There is also an [[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Tira Misu|Atkins friendly recipe]].

== Warnings ==

*In this recipe the term &quot;ladyfingers&quot; refers to a kind of biscuit or cake, NOT to [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]], which would be an ''interesting'' variation.
*Whether thickening with egg whites or cream, ensure it is stiff before adding to the other ingredients; if it is not stiff, the tiramisu will not set properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For about six months, I lived out of a 1990 Nissan Sentra 2 door sedan

To create enough space in the rear area (passenger seats and trunk) that I could lie down with my legs outstretched, I remove the rear seat and back rest,  as well as a particleboard wall separating the passenger area and the trunk.  From a foam shop in Palo Alto, I bought a 5 x 8 sheet of 3 in. polyurethane foam, which I cut to (roughly) fit the trunk and seat area.  

I had the rear side windows, and rear window tinted as dark as possible (95% light blocked).  A casual observer could not see in, if you didn't have a light on, and they weren't close to the vehicle.  

To hide my sleeping self from prying eyes, I bought a blue window curtain from Walmart.  I took the curtain to a seamstress.  She doubled it up, thereby making it opaque, as well as shortening it enough so that it hung just below the seats.   I hung the curtain from a spring tensioned shower rod placed just behind the back seats.  The curtain and rod could be removed quickly if I didn't want to make it appear that I was living in the car.

{{spice}}

'''Oregano''' is a herb that is found in both [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican cuisine]]. The leaves are used either fresh or dried, but the taste is stronger in the dried herb. The Mediterranean variety is mild in flavor, whereas its Mexican counterpart has a more earthly taste.  It can be used with anything that has [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] and in [[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|salads]], and is frequently used in [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] toppings and guacamole.

Oregano is very similar to [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], another herb from the same family, and is sometimes called ''wild marjoram'' or ''pot marjoram''. Oregano is stronger in flavor than marjoram, and marjoram is sweeter. 

Oregano is often used in combination with [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]].

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mad dr. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mad dr~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''&quot;The golden rule applies to cooking: Cook for others the way you'd like others to cook for you.&quot;'''''

I used to work in a restaurant with a chef who was a scar-faced, chip-toothed ex-soldier from Marseilles.  He cooked the most amazing food for the staff out of whatever needed using up.  His take on this was that you should always cook food &quot;with love, as if you were cooking for your mother&quot;.

&quot;Rum &amp; Rophy&quot; - I'm not sure exactly what this is about, but if it's what I think, the phrase an &quot;ethical grey area&quot; is a fairly major understatement here.  [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 15:03, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

'''Rophy'''

n : street name for [[Flunitrazepam]] [syn: R-2, Mexican valium, rope, roofy, roach, forget me drug, circle].

It is a date rape drug, part of the same &quot;ethical grey area&quot; as adding arsenic, strychnine, razor blades or shards of glass to a guest's meal.

I think it's hard to be &quot;combative&quot; when talking about date rape drugs.  It's like saying the holocaust was a sickening spectacle that only morally depraved people would take pleasure in is too &quot;combative.&quot;  Sometimes hard and fast moral lines need to be drawn, and that's what is being done here.
:Now, I know we aren't wikipedia, but let me cite part of their NPOV article &quot;Let the facts speak for themselves&quot;. &quot;Remember that readers will probably not take kindly to moralising. If you do not allow the facts to speak for themselves you may alienate readers and turn them against your position.&quot; Of Saddam Hussein &quot;You won't even need to say he was evil. That is why the article on Hitler does not start with &quot;Hitler was a bad man&quot;&quot; [[User:24.205.34.217|24.205.34.217]] 16:45, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== cerebrum ==
[[User:Fasten]], while I agree with you re: not using sentient beings in cooking, I don't think your phrasing is all that useful; it's combative for no reason. The rest of this page needs work too, though. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:41, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Indeed - all mammals have a cerebrum. I'm removing the reference, as it implies anything other than vegetarianism is wrong...

== For your consideration ==

Just wondering if the name of this entry is perhaps a bit too broad.  Perhaps a slightly more specific title, such as &quot;Ethical Considerations&quot;? [[User:MatthewMiddleton|MatthewMiddleton]] 17:52, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

I think the section on not adding things like alcohol to the cooking &quot;without consent&quot; needs tempering with a little common sense.  First of all, most alcohol in dishes evaporates by the time it's served.  Secondly, if you're serving the meal with open house on the wine cellar (as I usually do!), it seems a bit pointless.  There's a world of difference between a tot of sherry in a trifle and pot in the brownies - and if you object to alcohol on religious grounds, you're unlikely to get a dinner invitation from me! 10:29, 19 August 2007 (UTC)
-----
:Alcohol does NOT evaporate as quickly or completely as many people cavalierly presume. Not even close:
http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/AlcoholCooking.htm And frankly, if your bigotry is so strong you would not invite over to dinner someone because heavens forfend, you might have to make a dish with alcohol in it, the guest is better off not being part of your circle of friends to begin with. You are in essence acting the same as if you said you wouldn't have an observant Jew over because you'd have to avoid serving a salad with bacon mixed in.

== NPOV issue ==

I hope that I have succeeded in making this less POV, by describing what concerns guilty rich Westerners might have in neutral, descriptive way. I may however have gone to the other extreme.  I tried hard to be fair, but I'm quite cynical about many, if not most of these, coming from a place with many self-righteous hipster and yuppies.  Rather than adding disclaimers to each, I have attempted to echo the warning about doing your research in the lede. --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 20:46, 30 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

FAQ - frequently asked questions.

:'''Q''': This manual sucks! And I want one in my language! What can I do?
:'''A''': It's a wiki! You can edit any page and improve the manual yourself. You can even start and maintain a new translation (contact the programmer through [http://gentle.magnusmanske.de this page]).
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''Q''': Why does GENtle try to connect to the internet all the time?
:'''A''': An internet connection is mandatory for BLAST- and ReBase-searches, as well as for the online tools.
:'''A''': At the beginning of each GENtle session, a check for possible updates takes place, which also requires an internet connection. This can be turned off in the ''Tools/Options'' menu.
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''Q''': Why can't I perform a BLAST search for the amino acids coded by the selected DNA sequence?
:'''Q''': Why can't I extract amino acids from the selected DNA sequence?
:'''A''': A reading frame must be selected.
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''Q''': There's a problem with multiple users using GENtle on my Windows machine.
:'''A''': You might have to allow write access to &quot;local.db&quot; in the GENtle directory for all users involved.
:'''A''': You can turn off the &quot;registry settings bug&quot; via ''Tools/Options/Register protocols and extensions on startup''
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''Q''': New updates download, but don't install.
:'''A''': You need write access to the GENtle program directory. Alternatively, ask your friendly administrator to download the latest version of GENtle [http://gentle.magnusmanske.de here] and install it for you. Remind him that he'll have to do this every few weeks, which might convince him to give you write access...
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''Q''': I found a bug! And I want new functions as well! Can my favourite protease/marker/restriction enzyme be in the default installation? Where can I donate huge amounts of money for a poor programmer?
:'''A''': Add a [[GENtle/Bug reports|bug report]] or a [[GENtle/Feature requests|feature request]] right here in the wiki, or contact the author of GENtle through the [http://gentle.magnusmanske.de GENtle site].

----
New proteases to add!

How?
# Open any DNA or amino acid sequence
# Double-click the sequence
# Go to &quot;Proteases&quot;
# Click on &quot;New protease&quot;
# Enter name and sequence (one of the following)
;PreScission:L,E,V,L,F,Q|G,P
See [[GENtle/Sequence editor#Proteases|here]] for a more detailed description.</text>

[[image:GENtle_virtual_gel.png|thumb|Virtual gel.]]
A '''virtual''' agarose (DNA) '''gel''' can be generated or expanded via the [[GENtle/Restriction Assistant|Restriction Assistant]]. A new virtual gel will be created if none exists; otherwise, the existing one will be expanded.

Within the gel viewer, gel concentration can be varied. Also, labeling can be turned on/off. Gels can be printed, or saved/copied as an image.

The name of a lane can be changed by double-clicking on the lane.

You can chose one of several DNA markers. If your favorite marker is not there, you can file a [[GENtle/Feature requests|feature request]] or [[GENtle/DNA markers|add your own directly]].</text>

[[image:GENtle_restriction_assistant.png|thumb|The Restriction Assistant.]]
The Restriction Assistant can be invoked via menu ''Tools/Enzyme Assistant'', or through a click with the middle mouse button on a restriction site in the [[../DNA map/]]. For the latter, the selected enzyme is automatically selected in the list of &quot;Available enzymes&quot; (left). This list depends on the selections &quot;Group&quot; and &quot;Subselection&quot;. It can be sorted by enzyme name or number of cuts by clicking on the respective column title. For a selected enzyme, the resulting fragments are shown in the lower left list.

The list on the right shows the contents of the &quot;restriction cocktail&quot;, the enzymes already selected for cutting. The resulting fragments for these enzymes together are shown in the lower right list. The enzyme selected in the left list can be put in the cocktail via ''Add to cocktail''; all enzymes from the left list can be added at once via ''Add all''. An enzyme can be removed from the cocktail by selecting it in the right list, then via ''Remove enzyme''.

''Do not create fragments below ___ base pairs'', when selected, limits the fragments generated to a minimum size. ''Done'' exits the restriction assistant while preserving the changes mage to the cocktail, whereas ''Cancel'' will void all changes made.

''Start restriction'' (the scissors symbol) will initiate the simulated restriction. The result of this can be influenced by several further settings:
* ''Create fragments'' will generate the actual DNA sequences with their blunt/sticky ends that will result from a digestion with the cocktail. This option is pre-selected.
* ''Add to gel'' will add the fragments to a [[../Virtual Gel|virtual gel]], together in one lane.
* ''One lane each'' will alter the above so that each enzyme gets its own lane.
* ''Partial restriction'' will add all possible fragments to a virtual gel lane, simulating a partial (incomplete) restriction. The option ''One lane each'' is not available when ''Partial restriction'' is checked.

The restriction cocktail will be preserved so you can cut another DNA with that very enzyme combination, which is useful for an upcoming [[../Ligation/]].</text>

In this chapter, the narrator, David, talks to his dad about financial planning. His dad mentions how his barber helped him start planning his finances five years prior, and suggests that David go to talk to him about it.

David's dad had worked very hard his whole life, been frugal and done everything he knew how to do. However, without a well-formulated plan, he had little to show for it. Then, after talking with his barber, he was able to start setting himself up for a comfortable retirement.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The apostle John, brother of James and son of Zebedee, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples/apostles, is traditionally viewed as the author of the Gospel of John. According to church tradition he was the only one of the Twelve to live to an old age and die a natural death. This would mean either that he refers to himself in the Gospel, or that the final author/editor/compiler refers to him, as the &quot;disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;. This disciple is described as being present at Jesus' crucifixion, however, which is difficult to fit together with the information from the Synoptic Gospels, which suggest that all of the Twelve fled when Jesus was arrested, and only Peter is said to have followed at some distance (see further Mark 14:50, 54, 66-72). However, it is clear from John's Gospel, that John himself was meticulous in his description of the events surrounding the Crucifixion, including Jesus placing his mother Mary in the care of John.

There is at any rate significant debate about whether the Gospel of John was actually written by John the apostle. From internal evidence, one might conclude that Lazarus was the author, since he is the only named individual specifically referred to as the one whom Jesus loves (John 11:3). However, this reference to Lazarus is only a secondary reference to one of many people who Jesus loved and cannot easily support authorship of a Gospel.

Although authorship is still debated, historical testimonies strongly support John, the son of Zebedee, as the author of this Gospel as well as the other Johannine works (Epistles of John, Revelation). External evidence is found in the writings of the church fathers -- Ignatius, Polycarp, Tatian, Theophilus -- who testify that John wrote these works. Eusebius also testifies to the fact that John wrote his Gospel last of all, between 80 - 95 AD. This is further substantiated by Irenaeus who wrote that John eventually moved to Ephesus and lived to be an old man, living during the reign of Trajan (98 - 117 AD).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prologue, John 1:1-18 

Verses 1-18 are a prologue to the book of John. It is sometimes suggested that this section, with the exception of verses 6-8 and 15, which talk about John the Baptist, may have existed prior to its appearance in the Gospel as a hymn used in the early church. These verses serve as an introduction to the author's understanding of Jesus, and parallel the creation account of Genesis at several key points. John never says that Jesus is the Word of God &quot;become flesh&quot;, but he says the Word was in the beginning. So we must determine who is the Word. The Jewish Encyclopedia says the Word, logos (Memra) is an angel, an elohim, the Word that was present and active in every aspect of the Creation since the beginning of the world. 

This introduction also, aside from paralleling the creation account in Genesis, is divided into three parts. They include the role that the Word played in creation (the angel architect), and how it appeared throughout history as &quot;the angel of the Lord&quot;, and as a third part, the role the angel played by indwelling Jesus and its benefits. Out of all three parts, the third is the most different, most separated by authorship and the way the account is given. It seems to be of a more personal nature than the rest. 

This passage is often one that is confusing for those who are reading the Bible for the first time. The language is different than the language most people use in daily conversation. Therefore this passage requires the reader to really work to understand the message. The complexities of the passage definitely make the passage one that you cannot just gloss over. Therefore, it not wise to build too much theology on this obscure opening.

It is important to note, however, that the translation of &quot;logos&quot; to &quot;word&quot; in the first several verses is only one of several possibilities as to the contextual meaning of the word and is still a point of discussion among scholars. Other translations include reason and wisdom, plan, message, and even Torah. However, if any of the equally good words are used in place of the current translation, the introduction takes on a different connotation. If one believes that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one in the same but in different states, (much like water)it seems superfluous to say that the &quot;word,&quot; meaning Jesus, was with God in the beginning. So we can see that John is not trying to establish a doctrine of the Trinity. The text makes no allusion to a trinity, and it definitely does not say Jesus was with God. It says the word (Memara/angel) was with God, -the angel of Wisdom. 

Throughout the Gospel, John uses symbols and metaphors to represent Jesus in an abstract and somewhat mysterious way. He says the Memra/angel was in the beginning, but he does not say Jesus was. Nor does he say the word was made flesh. The Greek clearly says the logos made all thing. The logos made flesh and then tented among us in the body/temple of Jesus. Jesus is never called &quot;God the son&quot; but beginning in verse 14, from which point on the language of &quot;Son of God&quot; is used. 
 
''' The Word ''' The Word was with Eloah and ''was'' an elohim &quot; a God&quot; in the beginning. All angels are elohim. Some humans are also called elohim. Jesus reminded the Jews that they had been called to be the Father's elohim to the nations. &quot;Ye are Gods all of you and sons of the most high&quot;. God worked through his elohim/angel of Wisdom/Word in the Creation of the world. This Word was a conduit of life and the light of humanity. This light shines in the darkness, which represents a world which does not recognize God. The attributes of the Word in this passage parallel not only the way Jewish authors such as Philo of Alexandria wrote about the Word he called it the &quot;archangel&quot;, but also the Jewish tradition regarding Wisdom's role in creation and in other aspects of God's interaction with the world. 

''' Light ''' John uses light and darkness as symbols of good versus evil. The light of God fights against the darkness of sin. Jesus is the conduit of the angel who is a coduit of the light. It is called &quot;the angel of God's presence. It is not God, but God only deals with humans through mediators. No one has ever seen God nor heard his voice.

 The entire world was caped in darkness, and the Father sent his angel/elohim/logos/memra  into this world to bring true light (verse 9).

  What has come into being in him was life and the life was the light of all people.  The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. (Versus 4-5).  The author is relating the beginning of life to a life that cannot be stifled by darkness or death.

John the Baptist appears briefly as a messenger who gave testimony to the light, sent by God to prepare the way for Jesus (verses 6-8). John the Baptist was not to be confused with the light itself, rather as one sent to help others believe in the light that was the Word. It was always made especially clear that he was the prophet who's &quot;sole mission is to bear witness or testimony to the Father who sends the light to indwell Jesus. That was the reason he was born here on earth, to bear witness to the Light giver.

In verses 10-11 John writes that although (the Word) came into a world made through him, his own people did not recognize or receive him. In contrast, John assures that the people who do receive and believe will become sons of God. &quot;his own people&quot; refers to Jews in as they were, at that time, God's chosen people. 

The one who is the Word (the Angel of Wisdom) tented in the tent (body) of Jesus and lived among us. The prologue does not teach the incarnation when properly translated &quot;sarx egeneto&quot; Flesh it made, not &quot;it was made flesh&quot;.

 John and his companions saw  Jesus' glory (the indwelling angel of God's presence -the shokeyn (mistranslated as shekinah) (verse 14). In the same verse John affirms that Jesus was God's one and only uniquely birthed human son (God is the father of myriads of spirits who are his elohim sons and daughters), and describes him as full of love and truth (the completed Torah). In different passages of the book, these two characteristics are emphasized. This is also the first time in the prologue that Jesus is referred to as God's son. At this point, John begins to use language that reflects the true human relationship: Father-Son. John the Baptist is mentioned a second time affirming Jesus' importance, and saying that Jesus was before him in rank although he was born after him. 

The Word/angel tabernacled in Jesus for a reason (so that we could become children of God) and He made his dwelling with us. The consequence for us is that we have the fullness of grace and He has given us the grace of the New completed Torah to replace the grace of the old Torah.
In verses 16-18 the author states that a greater gift came through Jesus than through Moses, as Moses gave the law (defective Torah) but Jesus brought love and truth (the completed and perfect Torah). Although no one has seen God (so that eliminates Jesus as being God), Jesus (the uniquely birthed human Son), who has intimate communion with God, has brought John, and the Christians in his audience, to know God. In John 17:20 John says he wrote his Gospel so that people could know the father, the only true God, and his messiah, Jesus.

The Prologue although wrapped in ancient poetry and often sounding like a riddle, does exactly that. It shows us God the Father sending his angel of wisdom to dwell in the body of Jesus his uniquely begotten and birthed human son: the first man to experience the spirit birth so that the complete Wisdom (torah) of God could be made available to humans and many could become his beloved children.

== Verses 19-34, John the Baptist gives testimony about Jesus ==

In this section, John the Baptist is confronted &quot;priests and Levites&quot; sent by the ''Jews of Jerusalem'' concerning his identity. The Levites and priests were greedy men who made a lucrative business in the maintenance and function of the Jewish temple. Though the story concerns many Jews (John the Baptist and Jesus were both Jewish) John's reference to the &quot;Jews of Jerusalem&quot; is done deliberately. The author uses the word ''Ioudaioi'', meaning ''Judeans'' as a literary device to describe the heads of Jewish institutions that opposed Jesus and his teachings. The priests and Levites ask if John the Baptist is the Messiah that was expected to come. They also inquire if he is Elijah or The Prophet. The question of John being the Prophet refers back to Deuteronomy 18:15, where Moses describes how God will provide another prophet, like Moses, who is a part of their people. John the Baptist answers that he is one sent &quot;as a voice that shouts in the desert: Make wide the path for the Lord,&quot; quoting Isaiah 40:3. In denying the title of Messiah, Prophet, or Elijah, John the Baptist is honoring the Lord. The titles of Messiah and Prophet are obviously reserved for Jesus. John the Baptist does not claim to be Elijah because he is not a reincarnation of Elijah, but the same spirit that rested on Elijah is in John. John only claims to be a ''prophetic voice'' that bears witness to the coming of the Lord. He goes on to explain that although he baptizes with water, he as a person is nothing compared to Jesus. (There is no record in scripture that Baptism was used by the Jews as a traditional cleansing rite although it was used by other marginal Jewish sects such as the Essenes)

John's answers to the religious leaders' questions proved to be difficult for them to use effectively. The leaders appear to be trying to trick John into saying he is the Messiah or one of the major prophets from the Old Testament so that they can refute what John is saying and ruin his credibility. John's answers to their questions, however, make it impossible for them to trap him in a statement that would discredit his message with the people. 

When John the Baptist sees Jesus, he declares &quot;Look, this is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world!&quot;and explains that Jesus is the one that he has been preaching about. John saw Jesus as the one who would make the true atonement for sin. The only problem is that in the atonement ritual it was a goat. Jesus was anti goats. He compared those going into the fire of hell to goats. He also taught that God did not want sacrifices. So John got it wrong. As we'll see John got other things wrong.

At the river the next day, John the Baptist explains how he saw the Holy Spirit descend on Jesus like a dove, and the God had told him that Jesus would baptize with that same Holy Spirit. So the water baptism of John would cease and be replaced by the Spirit Baptism.

 John the Baptist also claims to be a witness to the fact that Jesus was the Son of God. John the Baptist is very clear about who Jesus is: although he describes Jesus as a man who comes after him, which is usually a sign of discipleship, the Baptist  mentions that Jesus ranks ahead of him. 

It is important to note that John the Baptist does not actually baptize Jesus in John's Gospel; yet he gives an account of seeing &quot;the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him&quot; (John 1:32). This was the born again being baptized by the spirit moment for Jesus. He was the first man to be spirit-born.

This was when the Elohim/angel of wisdom indwelled the temple/body of Jesus. Now he could truly say as he did &quot;The Father is in me.&quot; 

Now since God only interacts with people through a mediator, how could the father be in him? He was in him via &quot;the angel of his presence.&quot; The angel of wisdom was the conduit through which God dealt with Jesus and Jesus was the human conduit to humans -the chosen vessel -the messiah.

 It is also important to note that although John is quoted in ways that suggests his belief that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah and his devotion to him, he appears to have not become a disciple of Jesus, but rather continued his own independent ministry. In Matthew and Luke, John is even reported to have sent his own disciples to Jesus to confirm or deny his messianic ambitions (Matt 11:4, Luke 7:22). That's why the least member of the Kingdom is greater than John.

Verse 32, &quot;Then John gave his testimony: 'I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him'&quot; has three interpretations, one of which was eventually rejected from Orthodox Christian doctrine. This view takes 1:32 to refer to the same event as 1:14, thus indicating that for this author the baptism is the moment of the Incarnation. In this interpretation, the terms &quot;Word&quot; and &quot;Spirit&quot; are thought to refer to the same thing, as they clearly did in the Judaism of this period, and also seem to have even into the early Patristic period within Christianity. 

The classic orthodox viewpoint is that the incarnation takes place at the moment of Jesus' miraculous conception. It is worth noting that John, who alone emphasizes the incarnation, includes no story about Jesus' conception, while those Gospels that contain stories about Jesus' miraculous conception do not depict him as the Word incarnate. Indeed, the Gospel of Luke, which contains an account of the virginal conception, has a Christology that seems to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from John, viewing Jesus as a man empowered by God's Spirit, whom &quot;God has made both Lord and Christ&quot;.

If the Spirit remaining on Jesus and the Word becoming flesh refer to the same event, this might explain the reference in 1 John to the Christ having come &quot;not by water only, but by water and blood&quot;, as well as the fact that, when read chronologically, John's testimony to the light in the Prologue occurs both before and after the incarnation. This interpretation can be found in later Jewish Christian writings such as the Pseudo-Clementine literature [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-08/anf08-28.htm#P1233_299015], and is supported by contemporary scholars such as Charles Talbert and Francis Watson.

The third view is that Jesus was thought by the Father into Mary's womb as a human sperm and he was fully human and never existed prior to his conception. But in The Father's plan this human was chosen before the world began to be the messiah. So he was born as the messiah and at the Jordan River the Spirit that entered him was the angel of God's presence, the angel of Wisdom who was with God at the beginning as his architect. He was called the logos. Jesus said I heal you by the logos and he said they rejected him because they had never found room in their hearts for the logos. The angel of Wisdom -the angel of the Father's presence stayed with Jesus until his final moments on the cross, then it departed and Jesus cried &quot;Why have you forsaken me?&quot; 

The significance of this story is to show how John was imperfect, he misunderstood that Jesus was not to be an atoment, he tried to stop the baptism, and he never followed Jesus. He continued on baptizing with water even though he knew the spirit baptism was the true and only baptism that matters. In the end he was in prison doubting Jesus.

On the positive side, John was the legal heir to the high priesthood and this encounter is a transfer of power. John was the last prophet of the old Testament and he says with all the prophets, &quot;Jesus is the Messiah, he must increase and I must decrease.&quot;

On a practical level Jesus says we must all be born again. God's angel must indwell each believer.

== Verses 35-51 Jesus calls his first disciples ==

John the Baptist had followers, and in verses 35-42 describe how two of these men, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, leave John the Baptist's side to follow Jesus. Andrew encountered Jesus first, and in one of the first recorded examples of Christian evangelism, runs to tell his brother that they had found the Messiah. When Jesus saw Peter, he gave him his semi-ironic but prophetic nickname, The Rock (v 42). Jesus then invites them to his home to spend the afternoon.

The next day, Jesus went to another area and called more people to follow him, Phillip and Nathaniel. Although Nathaniel at first responds with disbelief, &quot;Nazareth, can anything good come from there?&quot;, when Jesus reveals a bit about him he quickly comes to faith and declares that Jesus is the Messiah (the Son of God and the King of Israel.)

Finishing the section, Jesus declares that they will one day see heaven open and angels going up and down over the Son of Man. This is a reference to Jacob's dream of Genesis 28:10-17, where angels climbed up and down a ladder to heaven. &quot;Son of Man&quot; is a term with multiple meanings in the Jewish tradition. In many places throughout the Hebrew Scriptures it is simply used to refer a human being. For example, Ezekiel is referred to as &quot;son of man&quot; by God in many of his visions (Ezekiel 2:1, Ezekiel 7:2, etc.). When used by Jesus in the Gospels, though, Son of Man&quot; is probably a reference to Daniel 7:13 which was understood at the time to speak of the Messiah. This picture of the &quot;son of man&quot; receiving authority and an everlasting kingdom links this title with John's expression of Jesus as the Word. Thus, by calling himself the Son of Man, Jesus was understood by John's original audience to be declaring himself to be the Messiah awaited by the Jews.

''John'' 1:19-51 develops one of the major themes. The theme is testimony and it is written in four scenes. The first is John's negative testimony about himself; the second is his positive testimony about Jesus; the third is the revelation of Jesus to Peter and Andrew; and the fourth is the revelation of Jesus to Nathanael and Philip. The revelation of Jesus’ glory takes place in two phases. John, the Baptist recognizes that the Spirit's descent upon Jesus at his baptism is what allows him to recognize Jesus (1:32-33), but the incident itself is not recounted. The emphasis is on the Baptist's testimony arising from this incident (1:34). It is when the Baptist identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God in the hearing of some of his disciples that they become his first followers (1:35-37). John, the Baptist is a witness to Jesus and a model of true discipleship. 

The second phase is the gathering of disciples around Jesus, beginning with two of the Baptist's own disciples. This section offers many insights into the nature of discipleship. It is also astonishing for the number of titles given to Jesus right from the beginning, including Son of God (1:34, 49). These titles are part of the preparation for the glory, though the characters in the narrative do not yet understand their true significance. The section closes with Jesus' promise that they will &quot;see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&quot; (1:51), which prepares us for the revelation of God's glory that follows. 

This chapter of John begins with the rhetoric of the word being with God from the beginning, and then there is the story of John the Baptist denying he is the Christ. These two stories alone set the tone for the book of John by asserting the eternal existence of God and by determining the identity of Jesus. It is also important that Jesus begins to choose his disciples in this chapter since these are the devoted men that will follow Jesus through his crucifixion and resurrection. 


Another point of note found in the first chapter of the Fourth Gospel is John's first reference to an &quot;Israelite&quot; found in verse 47 in which Jesus makes reference to Nathanael as, &quot;an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.&quot; This reference is most significant because of the reputation that John's Gospel would later receive for its portrayal of &quot;the Jews.&quot; Most have viewed John's Gospel as being rather disparaging towards Judaism, and it is true that there is certainly a good degree of tension present in John's description of the relationship between the Early Christians and the Jewish community. However, that being said, as we can see from the introductory portion of his Gospel, his view on this matter was not as completely clear as has sometimes been suggested. While it is understandable that tension would exist between two rivaling religious groups in the same geographical area, it is unfair to generalize about John's feelings as they are certainly more complex than would be allowed by such a broad stroke.

I've put it on the book I listed on here since it seems to be the convention in use, but I'd like to know why it's done.

:[[Image:100%.png]], [[Image:50%.png]], and [[Image:25%.png]] are '''completion labels'''. They indicate how far a book has progressed and/or how completed it is. See the [[Main Page]] (on the right) or [[Template:Stages2]] for details. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 02:45, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Combining books on armour ===


 * Making Period Mail
 * Making Period Leather Armor
 * Making Basic Armor
are closely related.
Should we combine them all together into a
&quot;Society for Creative Anachronism&quot; book ?
Or an even more general book that would include
 * Conworlding
? (what would you call it ?)

:: IMO, the top three should probably be merged, but conworlding is a far broader, only tangentially related topic. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:02, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''Stereoisomers''' are isomers which have the same pattern of bonding but with atoms arranged differently in space. Stereoisomers are also known as '''geometric isomers''' but confusingly this latter term is often used to refer only to 'cis/trans isomers'.

There are two types of stereoisomer:

:;Enantiomers : two isomers which are mirror images of each other; also known as '''optical isomers''' due to the fact that two enantiomers will rotate plane-polarized light in equal, but opposite directions. '''Chirality''' is (yet) another term for enantiomerism.

:;Diastereomers : stereoisomers which are not enantiomers.

Stereoisomerism can be caused by:

:;Stereocenters : if a carbon atom has four different groups attached to it, it will exhibit enantiomerism. Other causes of enantiomerism include helical structures.

:;Non-rotation of bonds : the C=C bond cannot rotate and is the most common cause of diastereomerism. Other causes are cyclic compounds and steric hindrance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{LinguisticsTOC}}

==Overview==

Languages can be classified based on different kinds of criteria. The most common are based on phonological, morphological, or syntactical criteria. 

An important concept in linguistic typology is a ''linguistic universal''. Universals make statements that are true of all languages, and may either be ''absolute'' (''no language uses the raspberry sound phonemically'') or ''implicational'' (''languages with trial grammatical number also have dual grammatical number''). However as most of what are called 'universals' have at least a small number of exceptions, it is often more meaningful to talk about ''tendencies'' (e.g. ''SOV languages are very likely to be postpositional''). Note that one reason it is worthwhile to preserve dying languages is because many of what we now think are universals may turn out to only be tendencies, thus making us more aware of what can and can't occur in human language.

== Phonological typology ==

Certain phones occur often, while others are much less frequent, and some are more likely to be contrastive, while others usually group together with other phones as a single phoneme.

An example of a common phoneme is /t/. The overwhelming majority of languages possess it, though Hawaiian is an exception.

== Morphological typology ==

There are roughly four kinds of morphologies that languages use: Analytic, Inflectional, Agglutinative, and Polysynthetic. Morphological classifications are made based on how the morphology of the language works, that is, how are words formed, combined, and inflected (if they are). 

Analytic languages are not inflected, that is, nouns and adjectives are not declined and verbs are not conjugated. Instead, the order of the words determines grammatical relationships. English is an analytical language, though not perfectly so, because there are some agreement markers, tenses, etc in English. For example *'''he do''' is incorrect, because '''to do''' must be inflected to mark third person singular subject: '''he does'''. Chinese can also be said to be an analytic language, though words are so little inflected in Chinese, that some would classify it as a minimal grammar language. This is incorrect, since what languages lack in inflection (or ''morphology'') they must make up in word order, or ''syntax''; in a technical sense, both morphology and syntax are considered to form parts of ''grammar''. Both English and Chinese rely on syntax, word order, to show grammatical relationships, e.g. the subject must be in a certain position relative to the verb (in English, it must precede it).

Inflectional languages are different from analytic languages, because they do inflect (as the name suggests) quite a lot. A good example is Latin, in which most words are marked up and down for all kinds of tenses, moods, cases, agreements, and more. When the words in the sentence are inflected to show agreement with all their subjects, objects, and other arguments, then word order becomes very fluid. Whereas analytical languages rely on strict word order, inflectional languages have flexible word order. 

Agglutinative languages are those in which words can be combined easily. For example, instead of saying '''the shoe of the horse''', agglutinative languages say '''horseshoe'''. Agglutinative languages include German and Turkish. In these languages, new words are formed by combining old ones, so that words can become very long, but also contain a lot of information. This kind of morphology is called productive, because new words are formed in a predictable manner. Agglutinative languages can have both lots of agreements and inflections, or have rigid word order, such as German. 

The last kind of morphological category, polysynthetic languages, is the least understood by linguists, because none of the major written languages in the world today, such as English, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, etc, are polysynthetic. Some Native American languages in North America, such as Navajo, and some Polynesian languages are polysynthetic. Words, especially verbs, in these languages also tend to become very long, because every argument in a sentence is inflected on the verb, but also on other words with an argument structure, such as prepositions. These languages are very difficult to learn, not only because they are not properly understood, but also because one verb has literally hundreds of inflections. For example, the average Navajo verb has about 15 categories of prefixes, and a couple of affixes. These categories in turn, have between six and 200 members. In addition, the affixes can move around and change in agreement with other prefixes.

In reality, no natural language belongs exclusively to one category. Japanese, for example, has analytic pronouns (it uses postpositions to modify the role of nouns in a sentence), but inflectional/agglutinative in its verbs (''taberu'' means ''to eat''; ''tabenai'' means ''to not eat'').

== Syntactic typology ==

Syntactic typology distinguishes languages based on their preferred word order. The most commonly considered phrases considered are the subject, object, and verb. This gives six different possible orderings: SOV, SVO, VSO, OSV, OVS, VOS. The most common orders are SOV and SVO, constituting about 40% of languages each, with VSO constituting about 15%. The remaining five percent of languages have the object before the subject.

English and Mandarin Chinese are both commonly-spoken languages with SVO order. In Mandarin, for example, the simple sentence

(1a) '''Wǒ kàn shū'''

(1b) '''I read book'''

shows the same order as English, with the subject sentence-initial and the direct object following the verb.

By contrast, the about equally-common SOV order is found in languages such as Hindi/Urdu, Japanese, and Korean, among others. In the Japanese sentence

(2a) '''Watashi-ga hon-o yomimasu'''

(2b) '''I.subj book.obj read.polite'''

the verb appears in final position.

Some linguists have theorized that these orders are generalizations of a more general parameter on headedness. (The ''head'' of a phrase is the word which determines its type (e.g. in '''in the house''' the head is the word '''in''', which creates a prepositional phrase.) The theory is that the verb serves as the head of a verb phrase containing it and the object, and the subject combines with this phrase to create a sentence. By this logic languages with right-headedness are SOV, and those which are left-headed are SVO.

However, VSO languages, such as Classical Arabic, Welsh, and Tagalog, cause problems for this theory. Consider the Welsh sentence:

(3a) '''Siaradodd Lloyd y Gymraeg'''

(3b) '''speak.past Lloyd DEF Welsh'''

It is not immediately clear how the verb could combine with the object to form a phrase without also combining with the subject. While more could be said about this, it should be clear that word order typology is important for understanding how sentences are parsed.</text>

The ligation dialog is a means for virtually ligating two (or more) DNA fragments. It can be invoked via ''Tools/Ligation'' or &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-L&lt;/tt&gt;.

The left list shows all potential DNA sequences to be ligated. Some of these are automatically selected, but selection can be manually changed. The right list shows the possible products of a ligation of the selected sequences. Some circular products will be shown in two forms (A-B and B-A), which only differ visually.

The selected products will be generated as new sequences on clicking the ''Ligate'' button.</text>

* saved via ''File/Save Project'' or &lt;tt&gt;F12&lt;/tt&gt;
* closed via ''File/Close Project''
Depending on the [[../Options|options]], the last used project is automatically opened when GENtle starts.

Projects consists of a list of sequences, '''not''' the sequences themselves. If a sequence is renamed, moved or deleted, GENtle will dispay a warning next time a project containing that sequence is opened.

For efficient use of sequencing primers, one can create a project that contains all available sequencing primers, and then refer to that project in the [[../Sequencing Primers/]] dialog.</text>

[[File:GENtle_image_viewer.png|thumb|Image viewer.]]
The Image Viewer module can be invoked via ''Tools/Image viewer''. It can display images, such as gel photos, print them, or save them in another image format.

The viewer can read and write common formats, such as JPG, TIF, BMP, GIF, etc. In addition, it can read the IMG format used by the BioRad Molecular Analyst software.

The directory can be selected via the upper left button. The files in that directory are shown below. A single click on a file displays the image.

The context menu of the image contains entries to save or print the image, or copy it to the clipboard. For saving, PNG, TIF, BMP, and JPG are available formats, with PNG being the default, as it has the best lossless compression.

Labels of IMG images are shown on screen, print, and saved images by default. This can be changed through the &quot;Show labels&quot; checkbox beneath the file list.

An image can be inverted (black &lt;=&gt; white) through the &quot;Invert&quot; checkbox.</text>

[[../Sequence map|Sequence]] and [[../DNA map/]]s can be printed via the respective context menus or the ''File'' menu.

For [[../DNA/]] sequences, a report can be printed via ''File/Print report''. It contains the DNA map and a list of the features annotated in the sequence. This can be useful for a detailed overview of the sequence where the sequence itself is not required.</text>

[[image:GENtle_dna.png|thumb|The DNA modul.]]
Within the DNA module, DNA sequences can be viewed, edited and annotated. It is the central module of GENtle. Two major components of the DNA module are the [[../DNA map/]] and the [[../Sequence map/]]; see there for details.

== Open and display DNA ==
A DNA sequence can be opened in one of the following ways:
* Open from a database (see [[../Databases/]])
* Import from file (see [[../Import/]])
* Manual input (see [[../Enter sequence/]])
* Create from another DNA module

== Toolbar ==
Several functions and display options can be invoked in the tool bar:
* [[../Enter sequence/]]
* [[../Databases|Open sequence]]
* Save sequence
* Undo
* Cut
* Copy
* Paste
* Toggle linear/circular
* Show/hide open reading frames
* Show/hide features
* Show/hide restriction sites
* Expand (=show only) map
* Toggle edit mode
* Zoom

== Detail tree ==
The detail tree, left of the DNA map, shows all parts of the current sequence, including features and restriction enzymes, in a structured fashion. Features and restriction enzymes can be toggled in visibility by a double click, or further manipulated through the context menu.

== Special menus ==
{| border=1 cellpadding=2
|View/Show 3'-&gt;5'||Show the complementary DNA strand in the sequence map
|-
|Edit/Edit ORFs||Change the settings for open reading frame display
|-
|Edit/Show possible sequencing primers||Opens the [[../Sequencing Primers/]] dialog, which can add possible sequencing primers as features
|-
|Edit/Remove sequencing primers||Removes all sequencing primers generated by the above function from the sequence
|-
|Edit/[[../Automatic annotation|Auto-annotate sequence]]||Finds features from common vectors and other databases in the current sequence
|-
|File/Print map||Prints the [[../DNA map/]]
|-
|File/Print sequence||Prints the [[../Sequence map/]]
|-
|File/Print report||Prints a brief overview. See [[../Printing/]]

== Recommendation for better Example code ==

The last example code is as follows:
 for($i = 0, $count = count($menu); $i &lt; $count; $i++)
 {
  echo($i + 1 . &quot;. &quot; . $menu[$i] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
 }

Instead I would go for:

 for($i = 0; $i &lt; count($menu); $i++)
 {
  echo($i + 1 . &quot;. &quot; . $menu[$i] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
 }

Althought you were trying to show the case that you can write a code inside a For Loop, we need to make sure the people coming and reading this book get the professional view and then when they start writing PHP, they will start with a more professional way.

[[image:GENtle_sequence_map.png|thumb|The sequence map.]]
The sequence map is used by most GENtle modules. It shows sequences of DNA or amino acids, as well as primers, features, restriction sites and more. The basic behaviour, however, is always similar.

== Clicks ==
A double click usuaqlly opens the [[../Sequence editor|editor]] for the sequence.

== Context menu ==
The available functions in the context menu vary with the module the sequence map is used in, its state, and selection.
{| border=1 cellpadding=2
|Edit sequence||Turn on edit mode
|-
|Transform sequence||Invert and/or complement the sequence ([[../DNA/]] module only)
|-
|Limit enzymes||Limit enzymes so that only enzymes below a certain number of cuts in the sequence is shown ([[../DNA/]] module only)
|-
|PCR||Compare [[../DNA map#Background|DNA map]]
|-
|Selection||Compare [[../DNA map#Background|DNA map]]
|-
|Copy as image||Copies the sequence map as a bitmap to the clipboard ('''Caveat :''' Such a bitmap can take up a huge amount of memory, depending on the length of the sequence)
|-
|Save as image||Saves the sequence map in one of several image formats
|-
|Print sequence||Prints the sequence
|}

== Keys ==
The whole sequence can be marked by &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-A&lt;/tt&gt;. The [[../Find/]] dialog can be invoked by &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-F&lt;/tt&gt;. Both functions can also be called upon through a menu.

In the DNA and PCR modules, the amino acid reading frame can be toggled by keys like this:
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-1&lt;/tt&gt; = reading frame 1
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-2&lt;/tt&gt; = reading frame 2
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-3&lt;/tt&gt; = reading frame 3
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-4&lt;/tt&gt; = reading frame 1, complementary strand
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-5&lt;/tt&gt; = reading frame 2, complementary strand
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-6&lt;/tt&gt; = reading frame 3, complementary strand
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-7&lt;/tt&gt; = all reading frames, one-letter code
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-8&lt;/tt&gt; = known reading frames only (from the features)
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-0&lt;/tt&gt; = hide amino acids
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-W&lt;/tt&gt; = three-letter code (not when displaying all reading frames)
* &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-Q&lt;/tt&gt; = one-letter code

== Edit mode ==
Display and edit mode can be toggled by &lt;tt&gt;F2&lt;/tt&gt; or the toolbar. During editing, the sequence display is maximized, and the DNA map is hidden, improving ease of edit. Depending on the current module, only some keys are allowed (in the DNA module, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;T&quot;) by default; any other key will trigger a request to allow all keys for that sequence, for that session. The cursor can be moved similar to that in a text editor. Insert and overwrite mode can be toggled, except for some modules like PCR or Sequencing, where overwrite mode is mandatory. In these modules, backspace and delete are diasbeled as well.

When editing a primer in PCR mode, the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; key copies the base at the current position from the 3'&amp;rarr;5' or 5'&amp;rarr;3' sequence, respectively.

== Horizontal mode ==
In some modules, the sequence display can be toggled to horizontal. This can enhance visibility. Printing, however, is always done in standard (&quot;vertical&quot;) mode.</text>

IMO the first solution provided is bad practice as it skips proper validation of user input.
Besides&lt;br&gt;
- it my cause nonsensical database queries, which isn't fatal, but unwanted&lt;br&gt;
- it is overly complicated

Using magic quotes is bad practice too, see: http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.variables.php&lt;br&gt;
--Marek 25.01.2005

There needs to be an additional section on PHP 5's mysqli library and using positional parameters.
Example (where $db is a connnection):
&lt;pre&gt;
$name = &quot;Joe&quot;;
$age = 5;
$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO customers (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;);
$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;si&quot;, $name, $age);
$stmt-&gt;mysqli_stmt_execute();
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above will properly escape $name and $age, and will also perform better in some cases when inserting multiple rows when the same prepared statement can be reused.

Please note that the SQL syntax for DELETE statement is wrong in the given example:
  SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE username = '\';DELETE * FROM `forum` WHERE title != \''
The correct form is as shown below:
  SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE username = '\';DELETE FROM `forum` WHERE title != \''
Also when we try to execute the above statement from within a mySQL client it will be executed successfully.

:Thanks - I'll update the article. The MySQL client has always allowed query stacking, but I've tried to do it in PHP and it failed. The SQL parser in one of my PHP apps actually kills the connection if it detects a stacked query. --[[User:Dandaman32|Dandaman32]] 14:31, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
==Obvious fix for problems (Although impossible to carry out)==

Stop using acceptable ascii codes for code execution...  Yes, I'm talking about wrecking programming languages as we know them, but nobody said they were perfect.  Seriously though, the real problem: these functions accept standard ascci and execute standard ascii. I know... not helpful but still an interesting thought--[[User:Kyle van der Meer|Kyle van der Meer]] ([[User talk:Kyle van der Meer|talk]]) 13:46, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

FYI, mysql_query can only execute a single statement, so the DELETE example is bogus. 
regards, adam

== removal of the second query injection claim ==

as adam pointed out, mysql_query in php (and i'm guessing the underlying C, but i'm not sure) doesn't allow execution of a second query. i wasn't logged in, but the edit to remove all the stuff about appending a DELETE statement was me. sorry that it's not a thorough edit and i didn't replace it with any discussion of the real scope of sql injection in mysql_query, but i considered the problem serious enough to cut it out in a quick edit. this page has a pretty high pagerank and shows up prominently in some searches for sql injection vulnerabilities in php.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''MD5''' is a popular Hash Function used by many people around the world.
Developed by '''Professor Ronald L. Rivest of MIT'''

It has two purposes:

#Verify the integrity of a file after a specified period of time
#Generate Hash values for a certain piece of data ( Ex: file) and store them, for later cross  checking if the file has been modified or not (this is in essence the 1st point stated above)

For example, on a system that has a file called &quot;SAMPLE.TXT&quot; the MD5 hash would look like this:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!filename ||           hash value
|-
|C:\SAMPLE.TXT ||      BC8FEFECA210FC0C0F3EBC1614A37889
|}

MD5 takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128- bit &quot;'''fingerprint'''&quot; or &quot;'''message digest'''&quot; of the input. It is conjectured that it is  computationally infeasible to produce any message having a given prespecified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm was intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be &quot;compressed&quot; in a  secure manner before being signed with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. However, practical attacks on the collision resistance of MD5 exist&lt;ref name=&quot;MD5 considered harmful today&quot;&gt;[http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/]Alexander Sotirov, Marc Stevens,
Jacob Appelbaum, Arjen Lenstra, David Molnar, Dag Arne Osvik, Benne de Weger: MD5 considered harmful today - Creating a rogue CA certificate
[http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/]&lt;/ref&gt;, and it should therefore not be used with digital signatures or any other application requiring collision resistance.

Exact technical information is described in [[RFC:1321]] ([http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html as HTML]).

----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Whenever two atoms form a bond, the nucleus of each atom attracts the other's electrons. '''Electronegativity''' is a measure of the strength of this attraction.

===Periodic trends===
Several traits of atoms are said to have &quot;periodic trends&quot;, meaning that different atoms in a period have identifiable relationships to one another based on their position.  Is that confusing?  Think of the periodic table as a group picture, maybe of a very large basketball team.  Each period is a row of players in the picture, and the &quot;photographer&quot; has decided to arrange the &quot;players&quot; by their characteristics.  Of course, no conscious effort was made to arrange the periodic table by  any characteristic other than number of protons, but some properties are consistent in its layout regardless.

Atomic size is one characteristic that shows a periodic trend.  In case of atomic radius the &quot;photographer&quot; (Mendeleev and others since) decided to arrange &quot;players&quot; (atoms) by size with the very shortest and smallest players at the top right.  As you go left to right along a row (a period) the atoms get sequentially smaller and smaller.  Fluorine is smaller than carbon, and carbon is smaller than magnesium.  This is due to the number of protons in the nucleus increasing, while the increasing number of electrons are unable to shield one another from the attractive force of the positive charge from the nucleus.

'''REMEMBER''': ''largest'' &gt; Li &gt; Be &gt; B &gt; C &gt; N &gt; O &gt; F &gt; Ne &gt; ''smallest''


Another characteristic with a periodic trend is ionization energy.  This is the amount of energy necessary to remove one electron from an atom.  Since all the atoms favor an electron configuration of a noble gas, the atoms at the extreme left of the table will give up their first electron most readily.  (In almost all cases, a metal will readily give up its first electron.)  The halogens, which need only one more electron to fill their outer shells, require a great deal of energy to give up an electron because they would be much more stable if they gained one electron instead.  Ionization energy is the opposite of atomic radius, therefore, because it increases from left to right across a period.

'''REMEMBER''': ''least energy to ionize'' &lt; Li &lt; Be &lt; B &lt; C &lt; N &lt; O &lt; F &lt; Ne &lt; ''most energy to ionize''


Electronegativity is perhaps the most important periodic trend, and it is not related to ionization energy directly -- but its trend is the same, increasing from left to right.  Also, the elements in a group (like the halogen group) gain stability as they grow in atomic number, so the smallest member of an electronegative group is often the most electronegative.  In general, it can be said that among periods (rows) or groups (columns) of the periodic table, the closer an element is to fluorine, the more electronegative it will be.  For Group VIIA (the aforementioned halogens) of the periodic table, you memorize the following relationships:

'''REMEMBER''': ''most electronegative'' &gt; F &gt; Cl &gt; Br &gt; I &gt; ''least electronegative''

And '''REMEMBER''': ''least electronegative'' &lt; Li &lt; Be &lt; B &lt; C &lt; N &lt; O &lt; F &lt; ''most electronegative''


(Notice that the noble gas Neon is not on the electronegativity chart.  In its non-ionized form, a noble gas is usually treated as if it has no electronegativity at all.)

===Electronegativities of atoms common in organic chemistry===
* C - 222.55
* H - 2411.20
* N - 3234.04
* O - 890.00
* P - 2466.19
* S - 2.e2458
* Cl - 3325.16
* Br - 22353.96
* F - 3563.98

Higher numbers represent a stronger attraction of electrons.

When atoms of similar electronegativity bond, a nonpolar [[Wikipedia:covalent|covalent]] bond is the result.

H-C
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

When atoms of slightly different electronegativities bond, a polar covalent bond results.

&amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; O-H &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

&amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; N-H &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

&amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; represent partial charges
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

When atoms of very different electronegativities bond, an ionic bond results.

&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom or molecule to attract electrons in the context of a chemical bond. The type of bond formed is largely determined by the difference in electronegativity between the atoms involved. Atoms with similar electronegativities will share an electron with each other and form a covalent bond. However, if the difference is too great, the electron will be permanently transferred to one atom and an ionic bond will form. Furthermore, in a covalent bond if one atom pulls slightly harder than the other, a polar covalent bond will form.

The reverse of electronegativity, the ability of an atom to lose electrons, is known as electropositivity.

Two scales of electronegativity are in common use: the Pauling scale (proposed in 1932) and the Mulliken scale (proposed in 1934). Another proposal is the Allred-Rochow scale.

== Pauling scale ==

The Pauling scale was devised in 1932 by Linus Pauling. On this scale, the most electronegative chemical element (fluorine) is given an electronegativity value of 3.98 (textbooks often state this value to be 4.0); the least electronegative element (francium) has a value of 0.7, and the remaining elements have values in between. On the Pauling scale, hydrogen is arbitrarily assigned a value of 2.1 or 2.2.

'δEN' is the difference in electronegativity between two atoms or elements. Bonds between atoms with a large electronegativity difference (greater than or equal to 1.7) are usually considered to be ionic, while values between 1.7 and 0.4 are considered polar covalent. Values below 0.4 are considered non-polar covalent bonds, and electronegativity differences of 0 indicate a completely non-polar covalent bond.

== Mulliken scale ==

The Mulliken scale was proposed by Robert S. Mulliken in 1934. On the Mulliken scale, numbers are obtained by averaging ionization potential and electron affinity. Consequently, the Mulliken electronegativities are expressed directly in energy units, usually electron volts.

== Electronegativity trends ==

Each element has a characteristic electronegativity ranging from 0 to 4 on the Pauling scale. The most strongly electronegative element, fluorine, has an electronegativity of 3.98 while weakly electronegative elements, such as lithium, have values close to 1. The least electronegative element is francium at 0.7. In general, the degree of electronegativity decreases down each group and increases across the periods, as shown below. Across a period, non-metals tend to gain electrons and metals tend to lose them due to the atom striving to achieve a stable octet. Down a group, the nuclear charge has less effect on the outermost shells. Therefore, the most electronegative atoms can be found in the upper, right hand side of the periodic table, and the least electronegative elements can be found at the bottom left. Consequently, in general, atomic radius decreases across the periodic table, but ionization energy increases.

'''What does the setpci utility do?'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;setpci is a utility for querying and configuring PCI devices.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''What would be the command to write a word in register N of a PCI device?'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;setpci -s 12:3.4 N.W=1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.

=== Configure Modem and Sound cards ===

=== Setup SCSI Devices ===

=== Setup different PC expansion cards ===

=== Configure Communication Devices ===

=== Configure USB devices ===

== Linux Installation &amp; Package Management ==

=== Design hard disk layout ===
'''To display periodically the virtual memory usage:'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;vmstat -n 1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Install a boot manager ===

=== Make and install programs from source ===
'''What steps should you follow to compile and install a program from source?'''&lt;br/&gt;
./configure&lt;br/&gt;
make&lt;br/&gt;
make install

=== Manage shared libraries ===

=== Use Debian package management ===
 To see what will be installed on your computer, use the command:
  dpkg -c package_name.deb
 If the package is already installed, you can see also what files were installed:
  dpkg -L package_name

dpkg-reconfigure &lt;package name&gt;

=== Use Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) ===
 To see what will be installed on your computer, use the command:
  rpm -qpl package_name.rpm

== GNU &amp; Unix Commands ==

=== Working on the command line ===
'' Get information on the useradd and userdel commands.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''man useradd'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''man userdel'''&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you have $PAGER set to less; Use SPACE to advance by one page, B to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'' Create two new accounts user1 and user2 and set the passwords to those accounts with the passwd command. As root lock the accounts and check if you can still log in.''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'' What is the command to concatenate files?''&lt;br /&gt;
'''cat  ''file1'' ''file2'' '''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'' Declare and Initialize the following environment variables NAME and LASTNAME. Use echo to print them out.''&lt;br /&gt;
'''set NAME=&quot;Joe&quot;'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''set LASTNAME=&quot;Bloggs&quot;'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''echo &quot;$NAME $LASTNAME&quot;'''&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''Start a new bash (type '''bash''') and check that you can still see those declared variables.''&lt;br /&gt;No&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'' Use '''exec''' to start a new bash session. Can you still see those declared variables?''&lt;br /&gt;Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'' Use '''date''' to display the month.''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'' Add a new user named notroot with root's rights and lock the root account.GNU and UNIX Commands''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a trick question.
The only account with root privileges is the one with a UID of zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could alter /etc/passwd so that “root” is called something else, which would have the a similar effect;  the account “root” would no longer exist.
With the possible exception of translation to a foreign language, I can’t see the point in doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You could set the SUID bit on all files on the file system for that authentic “Redmond style&quot; security but again, why would you want to?&lt;/P&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;

=== Process text streams using filters ===
   1. Use wildcard characters and list all filenames that contain any character followed by 'in' in the /etc directory.
        ls /etc/in*

   2. Use wildcard characters and list all filenames that start with any character between 'a' and 'e' that have at least two more characters and do not end with a number.
        ls [a-e]??[!0-9]
   3. Use wildcard characters and list all filenames of exactly 4 characters and all filenames starting with an uppercase letter. Do not descend into any directory found.
        ls -d [A-Z]???
   4. Use wildcard characters and list all files that contain 'sh' in /bin.
   5. Display your environment variable HOME preceded by the string &quot;$HOME value is:&quot;
   6. Display the contents of $SHELL with two asterisk characters before and after it.
   7. How would you display the following string of characters as is with echo using double quote and \.
          * @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) ' &quot; \
   8. Compose echo commands to display the following two strings:
          * That's what he said!
          * 'Never Again!' he replied.
   9. Display the number of words in all files that begin with the letter 'h' in the /etc directory.
  10. How would you send a 2M (megabyte) file with two 1.44 M floppy. How would you put back together the split file?
  11. What is the command to translate the : delimiter in /etc/password by #?
          cat /etc/password | tr &quot;:&quot; &quot;#&quot;

=== Perform basic file management ===
   1. Compose an interactive command to remove all .tmp files in your home directory. Respond y to every prompt.

rm -i ~/*.tmp

   2. List all the files in the user's home directories ending with .pdf that are bigger than 50 blocks and have not been accessed for a month.

find /home  -name &quot;*.pdf&quot; -atime +30 -size +50 -print

   3. Create a file file.h that will contain all the filenames ending with .h found in the /usr directory.

find /usr -name &quot;*.h&quot; &gt; file.h

   4. Do a touch on all the c files found in /usr/src/packages directory.
   5. What are the default permissions when you create a new file and a new directory?
      new file --&gt; 644
      new directory --&gt; 755

   6. How would you create a new file or directory that contains a space in the filename? (Example: 'new dir')
      touch new\ file.txt
      mkdir new\ dir
       
   7. What is the command to remove all the files of types char and block in your home directory?

   8. How would you find the location of the program find?
   9. Delete all files in /tmp which are not owned by root and have not been accessed for a week.

=== Use streams, pipes, and redirects ===
'''1. Create a file list.bin that will contain all the file names from the /bin directory.'''
&lt;pre&gt;
ls /bin &gt; list.bin
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''2. Write a command that will append the list of files from /usr/local/bin to the file named list.bin and discard any error output.'''
&lt;pre&gt;
ls /usr/local/bin &gt;&gt; list.bin 2&gt;/dev/null
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''3. Split your list.bin file into files that are 50 lines long and remove list.bin.'''
&lt;pre&gt;
split -l 50 list.bin
rm -f list.bin
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''4. From the split files recreate list.bin (but with inversed order).'''
&lt;pre&gt;
cat xab xaa &gt; list.bin
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''7. Write a command that will create a file list.sbin with the contents of /sbin and at the same time display it to standard output.'''
&lt;pre&gt;
ls /sbin | tee sbin.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''8. Create a file that within the filename you include the creation time.'''
&lt;pre&gt;
ls -l /sbin &gt; `date +%d_%m_%y.txt`
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''9. Create a file that will contain all the filenames in reverse order with extension .conf from the /etc directory.
ls *.conf'''
&lt;pre&gt;
ls /etc/*\.conf &gt; first.txt
tac first.conf &gt; end_list.txt
rm -f first.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Create, monitor, and kill processes ===
1. How can you control CPU usage for PID 3196
&lt;pre&gt;
top -p 3196
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Modify process execution priorities ===

=== Search text files using regular expressions ===

=== Perform basic file editing operations using vi ===

All of the vi commands below must of course be entered in command mode.

# &lt;tt&gt;vi foo&lt;/tt&gt;
# Most frequently one would use &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, but there are other ways of getting into command mode.
# &lt;tt&gt;ZZ&lt;/tt&gt;
# &lt;tt&gt;vi foo&lt;/tt&gt;
# &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt; opens a new line beneath the cursor position and drops you into command mode.  &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; puts you directly into command mode without making the new line, so &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt; is more efficient.
# &lt;tt&gt;press esc to get out of command mode&lt;tt/&gt;
# &lt;tt&gt;:q!&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Butter tarts (Tart au Sucre)''' are an extremely common dessert in Canada.  Many versions are made, some are gooey while some are not, and different nuts, fruits, and other fillings can be used.  Similar tarts can be found in the culinary traditions of [[Cookbook:Scottish cuisine|Scotland]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]].

== Ingredients ==

=== Dough ===

* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 1 large teaspoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 3/4 cup boiling water
* 3 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Pastry Flour|pastry flour]] or 3 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Filling ===

* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]] or [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 1/2 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]

== Procedure ==

=== Dough ===

# Mix up the shortening, butter, and water until creamy. 
# While it's still creamy and not yet cold, sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
# Mix gently until a dough forms. Try not to knead it while forming it into a large ball. 
# Separate the dough into two equal portions and chill 20 to 40 minutes.
# Separate the dough into two dozen equal balls.
# Roll each ball flat, ready to be placed.

=== Tarts ===

# Preheat oven to 350°F (175C).
# Beat the eggs well. 
# Add sugar, syrup, and melted butter and beat again. 
# Add the currants, walnuts, vinegar, salt, and vanilla extract and mix vigorously.
# Put a small amount of corn meal into tart tins, or count out 24 cupcake papers. 
# Place flat circles of uncooked pie crust into the pans, or place the circles into cupcake papers and insert them into the pans. 
# Fill the shells 2/3 full.
# Bake until the pastry is light brown, about 20 minutes.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Makes 4 dozen tarts.
* For runnier tarts, cook for 15 to 17 minutes.
* Replace the currants with [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], or omit entirely
* Replace the walnuts with [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]], or omit entirely
* Drizzle 4 oz (120 g) melted [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] over the cooked tarts
* This recipe (both the tarts and the pie crust) is a century-old recipe from rural North Western Ontario.

* If you are wanting a runnier tart (think old school Tim Horton's Butter Tarts) adjust 1 cup of corn syrup and 1 cup of brown sugar. 
* If the top of the tart hasn't frothed while baking and formed a cream coloured crunchy top it means there was too much time between when you beat the mixture and when it started baking. If you have to do multiple batched in the oven with the same mixture be sure to keep it cool and keep stirring it to make sure the second batch has the traditional crispy top.

You could also view the agere as having no stem, and there would be no point in listing it in a dictionary because there is no stem to list.

Is this correct

-[[User:159.28.161.52|159.28.161.52]] 03:41, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC) [[user:smkatz]]

== Case endings ==

I'm starting to use this book to learn Latin.  So my comments can be considered as end user views.
  
There is a note on case endings in the first topic &quot;What is Latin?&quot;.  I don't know anything about case endings, and am not sure if it is a common knowledge.  Is it appropriate to mention this in an introductary topic? --[[User:Sivaraj|Sivaraj]] 06:31, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Word Parts ==

What &quot;is&quot; a stem? I didn't understand the definition that is in the textbook. That's all.

I would remove all but the &quot;root&quot; and &quot;stem&quot; subsection from this section. For one thing, I have no idea what the subsection &quot;derivatives&quot; is trying to teach; the example makes no sense. I left it in for now on the off-chance it's just me, but it should probably go. (Plus, that's not usually what &quot;derivatives&quot; means to Latin students used to the context of, say, Latin &quot;caput&quot; leading to English &quot;capital.&quot;) As far as primitives are concerned, I've never used the term outside of linguistics class. Can we stick to basic Latin here? (Also, the subsection on suffixes can and should be merged with &quot;stem.&quot;) --[[User:Hieronymous85|Hieronymous85]] 15:08, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

In the Root discussion, I found the phrase &quot;which is in common to words of similar meaning&quot; confusing.  Perhaps the author meant either &quot;is in common with...&quot; or &quot;is common to&quot;.  But &quot;in common to&quot; is not a commonly used phrase in English.

== Nouns ==

This is not a standard definition at all. Where did whoever wrote this section find the definition? Pronouns and adjectives are not necessarily types of noun; they are separate parts of speech altogether.

&quot;Substantive&quot; should refer to nouns and adjectives used as nouns. 

&quot;Flexion&quot;? That appears to be a linguistics term used only in German. 

&quot;Accidents&quot; is overly technical.

Parenthetical explanations after gender, number and case are borderline wrong. Perhaps number can be ''discerned'' from the ending, but is not ''determined'' by it. Gender is not determined by the ending for either nouns, adjectives or pronouns, nor does a noun's ending necessarily reflect its gender (cf. quercus [f.], dominus [m.], tempus [n.]). Gender sometimes changes for nouns, in the case of so-called &quot;common&quot; nouns, such as ''canis''. Further, not all pronouns occur agree with their antecedents in case -- relative pronouns come to mind. At best, this section is misleading and confusing.

Can somebody justify all this, or should I just rewrite?
--[[User:Hieronymous85|Hieronymous85]] 15:32, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== conflection vs. inflection ==

'''The Stem'''

...When one adds an ending suffix to a word's stem, they are '''conflecting''' 

'''Suffixes'''

Latin uses suffixes known as 'endings' on stems to turn stems into words ... This is known as '''inflection'''. 


Seems like the same idea being expressed by two words, or what?

--[[User:Gzur|Gzur]] 23:42, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

== adverbs ==


nothing on those =p

&quot;used to qualify verbs or adjectives&quot; should read &quot;used to qualify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs&quot;.

== Basic Vocabulary ==

under word parts-&gt;the root, 'ago' is given to mean, I drive

but under primitives, the root ag is defined as to act

and later on, under verbs, 'ago' is defined as I do

could somebody please clarify all of the above?

:I've tried to clear it up a bit; I don't think much of this information is useful to a beginning Latinist anyway. --[[User:Hieronymous85|Hieronymous85]] 15:00, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

== Summary formatting? ==

With the current table, one might get the impression that there's a correlation between the items on each row.  A less inventive layout might be better. [[User:69.255.49.246|69.255.49.246]] 06:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

Agree.  Furthermore, the table indicates that pronouns are &quot;nouns used in place of substantives and adjectives&quot;.  I don't claim to know all aspects of grammar, but I'm I never learned, nor can imagine myself, a case where a pronoun is used in place of an adjective.  And even if this is somehow so, it is not mentioned above in the pronoun definition.

== Some bits ==

# It's not enough clear the difference between sentences and clauses; and &quot;sentence&quot; hasn't definition while &quot;clause&quot; has one.
# Suffixes are introduced before the &quot;ending&quot; concept. See &quot;The Stem&quot;.
# In the example for Derivatives is said «the stem ''flamm-'' from the word ''flamma'' has the root &quot;flag.&quot;» where &quot;flag.&quot; isn't written in italics and have a confusing dot too (the text uses italics without dots for roots; see ''ag'' in &quot;The Root&quot;).

The Democratic Party is, briefly, the party most associated with increasing social welfare through health care, unemployment benefits and other programs, of a more interventionist and protectionist economic policy compared to the Republican Party, and of a generally liberal stance on social issues.

==Brief history==
''More information: [[wikipedia:en:United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party of the United States]]''

The Democratic Party has its roots in the party of [[wikipedia:en:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]], but took shape after the [[wikipedia:en:U.S. presidential election, 1824|1824 election]], in which [[wikipedia:en:Andrew Jackson|Andrew Jackson]] won a plurality of the [[wikipedia:en:popular vote|popular vote]] but lost the election.  He formed a coalition of political allies to defeat [[wikipedia:en:John Quincy Adams|John Quincy Adams]], succeeding.  This group went on to become the modern Democratic Party.

In the run-up to the [[wikipedia:en:American Civil War|Civil War]] in the 1860s, the Democratic Party became increasingly fractured along a North-South split.  The most important dividing issue was [[wikipedia:en:slavery|slavery]], which the southern Democratic party supported, and the northerners did not.  The divided party produced two rival candidates for the [[wikipedia:en:U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860]] election, and did not run another successful presidential campaign until [[wikipedia:en:Grover Cleveland|Grover Cleveland]], well after the Civil War was over.  Cleveland was followed by the famed [[wikipedia:en:William Jennings Bryant|William Jennings Bryant]], who nevertheless lost to [[wikipedia:en:William McKinley|William McKinley]].  The next great Democratic leader was [[wikipedia:en:Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]], who led the country through [[Wikipedia:en:World War I|World War I]].  Republicans remained in control through the 1920s, but the subsequent [[wikipedia:en:Great Depression|Great Depression]] secured greater support for government intervention.  The result was the election of [[wikipedia:en:Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who went on to champion the [[wikipedia:en:New Deal|New Deal]] as he was re-elected an unprecedented three more times.  Roosevelt also directed the nation through [[wikipedia:en:World War II|World War II]], but died before the end of the war.

By the 1960s, a fundamental shift in American politics was beginning.  The [[wikipedia:en:Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights Movement]] became a potent political force that divided people along racial and geographic lines.  African Americans had previously supported the Republican Party in large numbers, but shifted after [[wikipedia:en:Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] showed strong support for civil rights.  Following Johnson, there have been two Democratic presidents: [[Wikipedia:en:Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter]] and [[wikipedia:en:Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]].

==Positions==
*[[Voter's Guide:United States - Affirmative Action|Affirmative Action]] - Support
*[[Issue Guide/Same-Sex Marriage/United States|Gay Marriage]] - varies among Democrats, many support gay marriage and more support civil unions
*[[Issue Guide/Invasion of Iraq|War in Iraq]] - supports staying in Iraq to establish a stable, democratic government; many Democrats were opposed to the war and most are critical of the handling of the war and its aftermath. Two nonbinding resolutions were voted on in the Senate in June 2006. One set a date on leaving Iraq; the other urged President Bush to start withdrawaling troops. Both resolutions failed.
*[[Voter's Guide:United States - Taxes|Taxes]] - generally supports raising taxes on the rich, and sometimes across-the-board, believes strongly in the [[wikipedia:en:progressive income tax|progressive income tax]]
*[[Voter's Guide:United States - Health Care|Health Care]] - supports health care funded by taxes for those who can not afford health insurance; some support a nationalized health care plan
*[[Voter's Guide:United States - Environmentalism|Environmentalism]] - supports more restrictions to protect the environment compared to the Republican Party

[[image:GENtle_alignments.png|thumb|Alignment.]]
The alignment module displays alignments of DNA and amino acid sequences. It can be invoked through ''Tools/Alignment'' or &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-G&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Settings dialog ==
The settings dialog will be invoked upon starting the module, or through the &quot;settings&quot; button in the toolbar. The sequences to align, their order, and the alignment algorithm and its parameters can be chosen here. The following algorithms are available:
{| border=1 cellpadding=2
|Clustal-W
|This (default) algorithm generates alignments of high quality, but is rather slow for simple alignments, and sometimes stumbles over local alignments.
|-
|Smith-Waterman
|An internal, fast, but simple algorithm for local alignments, that is, aligning one or multiple short sequences againast a long one. The long sequence has to be the first. It works great for checking [[../Sequencing|sequencing data]] against the expected sequence.
|-
|Needlemann-Wunsch
|An internal, fast, but simple algorithm for global alignments, that is, aligning sequences of roughly the same length (e.g., different alleles of a gene). As with Smith-Waterman, all alignments are made against the first sequence.
|}
'''Caveat :''' Clicking ''OK'' in this dialog will recalculate the alignment; the previous alignment and all manual changes made to it will be lost.

== Toolbar ==
Several functions and display options can be invoked in the tool bar:
* Enter sequence
* Open sequence
* Save sequence
* Print sequence
* Settings
* Horizontal mode
* Middle mouse button function

== View menu ==
Some display options can be combined with each other:
* Bold (shows characters in bold)
* Mono (black-and-white mode)
* Conserved (shows characters that match the one in the first line as dots)
* Identity (toggles the &quot;identity&quot; line)
Some of them exclude one another:
* Normal (shows colored text on white background)
* Inverted (shows white text on colored background)
Some other display options are planned, but not implemented as of now.

== Sequence display ==
The [[../Sequence map|sequence map]] can be altered through the context menu. These changes will only alter the display, &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; recalculate the alignment.
* Lines can be moved up or down
* Features for each line can be shown or hidden. By default, features for the first line are shown, features of the other lines are hidden.
* Gaps can be inserted or deleted, in this line, or all except this line. One of these four possible functions is additionally assigned to the middle mouse button; this setting can be changed in the toolbar.
* A double click on a character (&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; on a gap) opens the &quot;source&quot; window for that sequence (if available), marks and shows the position that was clicked in the alignment. This can be helpful for checking a sequencing.
* Sequences can be marked across multiple lines, then formatted via the ''Appearance'' context menu.

Sequences can &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; be edited within the alignment module. For that, you will have to edit the original sequence, then re-run the alignment.

== Notes ==
* Legend for the ClustalW consensus line:
:'''*''' = identical or conserved residues in all sequences in the alignment
:''':''' = indicates conserved substitutions
:'''.''' = indicates semi-conserved substitutions</text>
