==Historical background==
{{wikipedia|History of Japan}}
Written Japanese history began in the 700s AD, but the history of modern government in Japan has two distinct watersheds: the '''Meiji Restoration''' of 1868 and the occupation following '''World War II''', from 1945 to 1952. To understand Japanese government it is necessary to summarize the history of the country during this long period, focusing upon the two great watershed events.

===Pre-Meiji Japan===

For all of its recorded history, Japan has been headed, in one form or another, by an emperor or ''tenno'' (天皇), in an Imperial line that has allegedly remained unbroken from prehistory (660 BC, by Japanese mythology) to the present day. While the emperor ruled absolutely in early Japanese history, the power of the Imperial household declined around the 8th century AD, with the rise of powerful warrior houses and the dismantling of the Emperor's army.

From that era until 1868, Japan followed a feudal model of government, in which powerful warlords called ''daimyo'' (大名) ruled fiefs called ''kuni'' (国). Although the daimyo had practical power over the country, the Emperor was considered a living god in Japanese religion, and therefore had ''de jure'' status as the ruler of the nation from his palace in Kyoto, despite having little practical power.

Starting around the 1100s, the soldiers called ''samurai'' (侍) began to dominate society, emerging as a noble class at the top of the social hierarchy. In 1185, the Minamoto samurai family fought their way to dominate other clans and established the first military government or ''bakufu'' (幕府) of Japan in present-day Kamakura. The leader of the bakufu was called the ''shogun'' (将軍), and bakufu is often referred to in English as &quot;shogunate.&quot;

After a civil war in the late 1500s, a second bakufu led by the Tokugawa family was established in present-day Tokyo. Under the '''Tokugawa shogunate''', Japan retained its feudal structure but adopted a more centralized form of government than it had previously known. One of the key actions of the Tokugawa government was to banish all foreigners from Japan and close the country to all foreign trade in the early 1600s, save for a tiny Dutch trading post in Nagasaki. This period of isolation ended in 1854, when U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry successfully forced Japan to reopen its doors to trade. Once the technological disparity between the West and Japan became apparent to Japanese leaders, many sought to end the shogunate and modernize the country.

===Meiji and Taisho-era government===

In the Meiji Restoration, a group of samurai forced the shogun to resign, took the boy Emperor Meiji from his palace in Kyoto to the shogun's castle in Tokyo, installed the Emperor as the new head of the Japanese government, and defeated the armies still loyal to the shogun, effecting a total revolution in Japan. 

While Meiji himself was nominally the ruler of Japan, his advisors had practical control over the country. They promised to give Japan representative government, social equality, and industrial and technological advances from the West. The Emperor nationalized the fiefs of Japan between 1868 and 1871, consolidating them into '''prefectures'''; the daimyo were given noble rank and a share of their fief's output in exchange for relinquishing control.

Through several interim governments, one of the Emperor's advisors, '''Hirobumi Ito''', was tasked with examining various governments in the West and adopting a new government model for Japan. He drafted a constitution modeled after the German government, which was adopted in 1889. Although Japan now officially had a bicameral parliament and a court system, de facto control over the government was still firmly in the hands of the Emperor's advisors. This centralization of control continued during Japan's period of rapid industrial and military growth, lasting until the end of World War II.

===World War II and the Occupation===
{{wikipedia|Occupied Japan}}
One of the principal figures in postwar Japanese legal history is U.S. General '''Douglas MacArthur'''. After Japan's total defeat in 1945, MacArthur moved to Tokyo, took charge of the Allied occupation of Japan and began imposing a wide range of legal and political reforms. Overall, these reforms were aimed at pacifying and democratizing Japan.

The current constitution was drafted by MacArthur's staff, adopted by the Japanese leadership, and took effect in 1947. This constitution established Japan's current form of government and enshrined a number of political rights that had not previously been recognized, such as freedom of speech. MacArthur also ordered the nobility disbanded, broke up financial conglomerates called ''zaibatsu'' (財閥) that had previously dominated the economy, and pushed for a number of legal reforms, such as new corporate laws.

Since the end of the occupation in 1952, the overall model of the Japanese government has remained relatively unchanged, although many specific components of the system have been altered over the years to meet economic, political and social demands.

==The Emperor==
[[Image:Imperial_Palace_Tokyo_Panorama.jpg|thumb|250px|Imperial Palace, Chiyoda, Tokyo]]
The Emperor is Japan's head of state, but under the 1947 constitution, has very little practical role in the Japanese government. He is responsible for convening the National Diet, for appointing the Prime Minister and Chief Justice, and for other ceremonial tasks. To reinforce the Emperor's subservience to the people, he is governed by the '''Imperial Household Law''' of 1947 [http://web.archive.org/20010407104404/www.geocities.com/jtaliaferro.geo/1947law.html], a law passed and adopted by the Diet.

The Imperial Household Law is chiefly important in that it establishes rules for succession. Under Articles 1 and 2 of the Law, all Emperors must be male and a female is ineligible to inherit the throne. Historically, there have been several female Emperors, and currently, there are no male heirs capable of inheriting the throne more than two or three decades into the future. This has led to ongoing debate in Japan over whether to revise the law to permit females to inherit the throne.

===Rights of the Emperor===

Because of the Emperor's special constitutional status, his civil rights are limited in comparison to ordinary citizens. He does not have the right to bring suit in court (Supreme Court, Nov 20 1989), nor does he have the right to vote or travel freely.

==The National Diet==
[[Image:Kokkaigijido.jpg|thumb|250px|National Diet Building, Nagata-cho, Tokyo]]
The National Diet or ''Kokkai'' (国会) is the legislature of Japan. It functions similarly to a parliament in the Westminster model, as it is bicameral, and the lower house majority forms the government. However, it also resembles the American congressional model in that the upper house is elected, and both houses must generally consent to pass legislation.

The lower house is the '''House of Representatives''' or Shugiin (衆議院).

The upper house is the '''House of Councillors''' or Sangiin (参議院).

==The Cabinet==

The Cabinet (内閣 ''naikaku'') is the executive arm of the national government. It is comprised of Ministers of State (国務大臣 ''kokumu daijin'') headed by a Prime Minister (formally 内閣総理大臣 ''naikaku sori daijin''; informally 首相 ''shusho''). The Prime Minister is nominated by resolution of the Diet and appointed by command of the Emperor; the Prime Minister then elects the Ministers of State to form the Cabinet. The Prime Minister may remove and appoint Cabinet members at any time. (Constitution, Articles 6, 66, 67 and 68)

The Prime Minister must be a member of the Diet, and at least a majority of the Ministers of State must also be members of the Diet (Articles 67-68). All members of the cabinet must also be civilians (文民 ''bunmin'') (Article 66[2]), which is generally interpreted to exclude former members of the Imperial military and both former and current members of the Self-Defense Forces.

===Legislative process===

The Japanese lawmaking process is generally as follows:

* '''Proposals''' for new laws are sent to the Cabinet by ministries, agencies, Diet members, organizations, etc.
* For complicated matters, the Cabinet will often appoint a '''special committee'''.
* Either the Cabinet or its special committee refers the matter to '''affected ministries''' for input.
* The committee and ministry reports are reviewed by the '''Cabinet Legislation Bureau''', which drafts a bill.
* The bill goes to the government's (i.e. the ruling party/coalition's) '''political committee''', which finalizes it.
* The '''Prime Minister''' places the bill on the Diet floor for debate (Cabinet Law, Article 5).
* Both houses of the '''Diet''' vote to approve the bill.
* The Prime Minister and relevant Minister(s) of State countersign the bill (Constitution, Article 74).
* The '''Emperor''' seals the bill, and it becomes law.

==Elections==

===Article 15===

The most fundamental provisions governing all Japanese elections are found in Article 15 of the Constitution.

:'''Article 15:''' The people have the inalienable right to choose their public officials and to dismiss them.&lt;br /&gt;2) All public officials are servants of the whole community and not of any group thereof.&lt;br /&gt;3) Universal adult suffrage is guaranteed with regard to the election of public officials.&lt;br /&gt;4) In all elections, secrecy of the ballot shall not be violated. A voter shall not be answerable, publicly or privately, for the choice he has made.

Article 15 has been clarified by judicial precedent as follows:

* Labor unions may not penalize members for disregarding political endorsements. (Grand Bench, Dec 4 1968)
* The government has a responsibility to enable all citizens to vote, even if they are physically located outside of Japan. (Grand Bench, Sep 14 2005)
* Proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting are equally permissible to satisfy the right to choose public officials. (Grand Bench, Nov 10 1999)

===The Diet===

The houses of the Diet generally hold elections at separate times.

Members of the House of Councillors (upper house) serve for six years; there is an election every three years in which one-half of the members are subject to re-election.

Members of the House of Representatives have a maximum term of four years, which may be ended at any time by a dissolution of the House. The Cabinet is generally accepted to have the legal authority to dissolve the House at any time, although there are several competing schools of constitutional thought regarding this question.

* '''Article 69 theory''' holds that dissolution of the House may only take place when the House has voted for no confidence in the Cabinet under Article 69 of the Constitution. This is the only express constitutional grant of Cabinet authority to dissolve the House and is the narrowest reading possible of the document.
* '''Article 65 theory''' holds that dissolution of the House is part of the general grant of executive power found in Article 65 of the Constitution. as it does not fall under legislative or judicial power.
* '''Systemic theory''' holds that dissolution of the House is an inherent feature of the parliamentary system as it is generally employed throughout the world.
* '''Article 7 theory''' stems from the enumerated ability of the Emperor to dissolve the House (Article 7[3]). The Emperor must generally act with the advice and consent of the Cabinet in affairs of state (Article 3), and therefore the Cabinet is viewed to have the ability to force the Emperor's hand in dissolving the House.

==The bureaucracy==

===Entities===

From a legal personhood perspective, there are three types of government entity (''gyosei shutai'') in Japan:

* The nation (''kuni'')
* Local autonomous entities (''chiho kokyo dantai'') - prefectures, cities, towns, villages and other territorial entities
* Independent administrative corporations (''dokuritsu gyosei hojin'')

The nation and the various local entities are further subdivided into administrative organs (''gyosei cho''). At the national level, these take the form of ministries, agencies and committees. The upper-level organs of the national bureaucracy are:

* '''National Personnel Authority''' or Jinji in(人事院)
* '''Cabinet Office''' or Naikaku fu(内閣府)
** '''Imperial Household Agency''' or Kunai cho(宮内庁)
** '''Fair Trade Commission''' or Kosei torihiki iinkai(公正取引委員会)
** '''National Public Safety Commission''' or Kokka kouan iinkai(国家公安委員会)
*** '''National Police Agency''' or Keisatsu cho(警察庁)
** '''Financial Services Agency''' or Kinyu cho(金融庁)
* '''Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications''' or Soumu sho(総務省)
** '''Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission''' or Kogaito chosei iinkai(公害等調整委員会)
** '''Fire and Disaster Management Agency''' or Syobo cho(消防庁)
* '''Ministry of Justice''' or Houmu sho(法務省)
**'''Public Prosecutors Office'''s or Kensatsu cho(検察庁)
** '''Public Security Intelligence Agency''' or Kouan chosa cho(公安調査庁)
* '''Ministry of Foreign Affairs''' or Gaimu sho(外務省)
* '''Ministry of Finance''' or Zaimu sho(財務省)
** '''National Tax Agency''' or Kokuzei cho(国税庁)
* '''Ministry of Education, Sports, Science and Technology''' or Mombu kagaku sho(文部科学省)
** '''Agency for Cultural Affairs''' or Bunka cho(文化庁)
* '''Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare''' or Kosei rodo sho(厚生労働省)
** '''Central Labour Relations Commission''' or chuo rodo iinkai(中央労働委員会)
** '''Social Insurance Agency''' or Shakai hoken cho(社会保険庁)
* '''Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries''' or Norin suisan sho(農林水産省)
** '''Forestry Agency''' or Suisan cho(水産庁)
** '''Fisheries Agency''' or Rinya cho(林野庁)
* '''Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry''' or Keizai sangyo sho(経済産業省)
** '''Agency for National Resources and Energy''' or Shigen enerugi cho(資源エネルギー庁)
** '''Patent Office''' or Tokkyo cho(特許庁)
** '''Small and Medium Enterprise Agency''' or Chushokigyo cho(中小企業庁)
* '''Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport''' or Kokudo kotsu sho(国土交通省)
** '''Labour Relations Commission for Seafarers''' or Senin rodo iinkai(船員労働委員会)
** '''Meteorological Agency''' or Kisho cho(気象庁)
** '''Coast Guard''' or Kaijo hoan cho(海上保安庁)
** '''Marine Accident Inquiry Agency''' or Kainan sinpan cho(海難審判庁)
* '''Ministry of the Environment''' or Kankyou sho(環境省)
* '''Ministry of Defense''' or Bouei sho(防衛省)
** '''Joint Staff Office''' or Togo bakuryo kanbu(統合幕僚監部)
** '''Defense Facilities Administration Agency''' or Bouei shisetsu cho(防衛施設庁)

====National defense====
{{wikipedia|Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution}}
Japan's national defense activities are legally restricted by Article 9 of the Constitution, which reads:

:'''Article 9.''' Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.
:2. To accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.

As a result, the military forces of Japan are officially known as &quot;Self-Defense Forces,&quot; and equipment is generally named in a manner which connotes a purely defensive rather than offensive purpose.

===Regulation===

Bureaucratic regulation (''gyosei rippo'') comes in several types:

* Binding regulations
** Executive orders (''shikko meirei'')
** Mandate orders (''inin meirei'')
* Non-binding regulations
** Directives (''kunrei'')
** Circulars (''tsutatsu'')
** Standards of review (''shinsa kijun'')
** Administrative guidance (''gyosei shido'')

====Administrative guidance====
{{wikipedia|Administrative guidance}}
Administrative guidance is one of the most pervasive forms of government regulation. It generally consists of requests for voluntary cooperation from private actors where no law exists to compel such cooperation. It may take an assistive form (such as guidance concerning more productive farming techniques), or may take a restrictive form (such as guidance concerning pricing or environmental standards).

Article 32 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets forth three general principles governing the practice:

# Administrative guidance must not exceed the administrative scope of the agency or office issuing such guidance.
# Administrative guidance must be premised upon requiring the voluntary cooperation of the counterparty.
# Failure to follow administrative guidance must not be the basis for any detrimental treatment. In particular, if administrative guidance concerns the amendment or withdrawal of a government petition, and the counterparty refuses to follow such guidance, the government is required to halt guidance (Article 33).

The contents and responsible parties for any administrative guidance must also be made clear, and must be provided in writing upon demand.

Administrative guidance is not a binding administrative act and therefore is not invalidated by virtue of being illegal. However, damages incurred because of illegal administrative guidance may be the basis for a claim against the state under the State Compensation Act.

===Enforcement mechanisms===

====Administrative subrogation====
Administrative subrogation (行政代執行 gyōsei daishikkō) is the ability of an administrative agency (or third-party delegate) to perform an administrative duty on behalf of a non-performing obligor. It is the standard procedure for enforcing administrative duties, and is generally governed by the Administrative Subrogation Act.

Administrative subrogation has several prerequisites, listed in Article 2 of the Act.
* The duty in question must be directly ordered by law, or by an administrative agency acting under the law.
* The duty must be one which could be discharged by a party other than the obligor.
* The obligor must fail to perform the duty on their own.
* There must be difficulty in securing performance through other means.
* Waiver of performance must violate the public good.

The procedure of administrative subrogation is as follows:
# The administrative agency must provide a written warning to the obligor in advance, noting an appropriate deadline for performance and that subrogation will be ordered if that deadline is not met (Article 3.1).
# If the deadline is not met, the agency issues a subrogation warrant (代執行令書) which lists the deadline for subrogation, the name of the responsible party for the procedure and the estimated costs for the procedure. The warrant is then sent to the obligor (Article 3.2). This step may be bypassed if there is an urgent need to complete the procedure (Article 3.3).
# The responsible party may then go on-site. They must carry identification of their status and show it upon demand (Article 4).
# Costs of performance are borne by the obligor (Article 2) but must be clearly specified, along with a deadline for payment, in a written notice for the obligor (Article 5). If the obligor fails to pay, the agency may collect through two other means:
#* Collection through the national tax collection system (Article 6.1)
#* Lien against the obligor's property, which will rank junior to any national or regional tax liens (Article 6.2).

====Other methods====

Timely enforcement (即時強制 ''sokuji kyōsei'') is used in situations where administrative law has been breached and immediate action is needed to correct the situation. An example would be a police officer taking a dangerously intoxicated person to the police station for sobering-up, or a fire brigade destroying buildings in order to contain a rapidly-spreading blaze.

Administrative penalties (行政罰 ''gyōsei batsu'') may take the form of criminal penalties or small fines.

===Review mechanisms===

====Information disclosure====

The Act Regarding Disclosure of Information Held By Administrative Organs (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律), commonly known as the Information Disclosure Act (情報公開法 ''Jōhō kōkai hō''), provides a system for demanding the disclosure of public documents.

====Administrative appeals====

The Administrative Appeal Act (行政不服審査法 ''Gyōsei fufuku shinsa-hō'') provides for three types of appeal against administrative decisions:
# Objection (異議申立て ''igi mōshitate''): filed against cabinet ministries and local government heads who have no direct overseeing entity
# Demand for review (審査請求 ''shinsa seikyū''): filed against overseeing entities with regard to the acts (or failures to act) of entities under their supervision
# Demand for second review (再審査請求 ''sai-shinsa seikyū''): appeal of a demand for review

An objection or demand for review must be filed within 60 days of receiving notice of the act in question, and within one year of the act itself (the one-year limit may be extended upon showing of cause). There is no time limit on filing appeal of an inaction. All substantive portions of these procedures are conducted in writing, although parties may be called to give oral testimony as part of the process.

An appeal petition does not ordinarily stop the government from continuing the act in question. In a demand for review, the overseeing entity may voluntarily order the deciding entity to suspend execution of its decision pending resolution of the appeal. This injunction may be issued unilaterally or at the request of the petitioner. An injunction must be granted by an overseeing entity if necessary to avoid grave harm to the petitioner as a result of the decision; however, if the injunction would cause major effects on the public welfare, the injunction may be withheld.

The response to an objection is called a decision (決定 ''kettei''), and the response to a demand for review is called a ruling (裁決, ''saiketsu''). In either case, there may be one of four results:

# Dismissal for procedural reasons (却下 ''kyakka'') is decided when the appeal has procedural flaws, such as when it is provided in an incorrect format or outside the prescribed time frame.
# Dismissal on the merits (棄却 ''kikyaku'') is decided when the appeal is procedurally sound, but when there is no factual reason to support the appeal.
# A circumstantial (事情 ''jijō'') decision or ruling is issued where the appeal has merit, but where overturning the decision would cause major harm to the public. This has the same effect as dismissal on the merits.
# Otherwise, acceptance (認容 ''nin'yō'') of the appeal is issued. Should the appeal be accepted, the act in question may be overturned in whole or in part and any past enforcement may be declared invalid (and the appellant restored to their pre-enforcement position). The act may also be amended to the extent necessary to make it legal. If an appeal of an inaction is accepted, the non-acting entity must act promptly following the acceptance of the appeal.

====Administrative litigation====

The Administrative Litigation Act (行政事件訴訟法 ''Gyōsei jiken soshō hō'') governs lawsuits against the government. Such suits are brought in courts (i.e. the judiciary) rather than within the entity whose act is being appealed. The decision to appeal or litigate is generally voluntary, but certain special cases (such as tax-related claims) require that the administrative appeal process be completed before a court may hear the case. There are four types of administrative litigation:

# Appellate litigation (抗告訴訟　''kōkoku soshō''): Appeal of an unlawful use of government authority. Appellate litigation regarding an administrative act is time-barred if not brought within six months of becoming aware of the act in question, or one year following the act, whichever comes first. There are six sub-types:
#* Action to revoke a disposition
#* Action to revoke a decision
#* Action to confirm invalidity
#* Action to confirm illegality of an inaction
#* Action to establish a duty
#* Action to enjoin
# Ex parte litigation (当事者訴訟 ''tōjisha soshō''): Resolution of a public law issue in the context of a private dispute. There are two sub-types:
#* De jure ex parte litigation: Confirmation of a legal relationship between the parties, e.g. a dispute over title to property as the result of an allegedly illegal expropriation.
#* De facto ex parte litigation: Litigation related to a legal relationship under public law, e.g. a dispute over the legality of the firing of a public servant.
# Popular litigation (民衆訴訟 ''minshū soshō''): Action of affected individuals against the government, e.g. contesting an election result.
# Entity litigation (機関訴訟 ''kikan soshō''): Litigation between administrative entities or organs, e.g. a dispute between a mayor and a city assembly.

====Claims for damages====

Japan also has a State Liability Act (国家賠償法) which allows aggrieved parties to claim damages against the government. Such claims are permitted in two instances:

* Where a public official, acting in the course of exercising public authority, intentionally or negligently harms another person in violation of the law (Article 1). In an Article 1 case, the government may demand indemnification from the public official when the act was intentional or grossly negligent (Article 1.2).
* Strict liability where a person is harmed due to defects in a road, waterway or other public structure (Article 2). The state may demand indemnification from another person responsible for the harm (Article 2.2). If the structure is owned and operated by different entities, each entity may be held liable (Article 3).

Aliens may also claim against the state under the Act, but only if a &quot;reciprocal guarantee&quot; (相互の保証) has been provided to Japanese nationals by the government of the alien plaintiff's home country (Article 6).

==The judiciary==
{{wikipedia|Judicial system of Japan}}
The judiciary is constitutionally responsible for conducting all final civil, criminal and administrative trials. Administrative entities may conduct initial reviews, but all decisions in such reviews are subject to review by the judiciary (Article 76).

===Court system===

* '''Supreme Court''' or Saiko saibansho(最高裁判所)
** '''High Court'''s or Koto saibansho(高等裁判所) (8)
*** '''District Court'''s or Chiho saibansho(地方裁判所) (50)
**** '''Summary Court'''s or Kani saibansho(簡易裁判所) (438)
*** '''Family Court'''s or Katei saibansho(家庭裁判所) (50)

The Constitution only provides for the Supreme Court, and delegates the task of establishing lower courts to the Diet.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the Emperor at the nomination of the Cabinet (Article 6.2). Other judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the Cabinet with the certification of the Emperor (Article 79). Lower court judges are appointed by the Cabinet at the nomination of the Supreme Court (Article 80).

All judges are appointed for ten-year terms and are required to retire upon reaching the mandatory retirement age (Article 80).

===Legal professions===

'''Bengoshi''' (弁護士) are &quot;attorneys at law.&quot; Like barristers in the British Commonwealth, they tend to specialize in appearing before courts, as this is the only field in which they hold a true monopoly. However, many bengoshi now have practices in corporate and commercial law as well, particularly in the major international law firms in Tokyo. Admission to the bar is very strictly regulated; the bar exam pass rate is generally kept between 2 and 3 percent, and the average bengoshi must take the exam six or seven times in order to pass (with only one sitting available per year). After taking the bar exam (generally following their bachelor's degree), bengoshi spend two years as Shiho shushusei (司法修習生); &quot;law trainees&quot; at the Legal Research and Training Institute (司法研修所) of the Supreme Court of Japan, where they are separated into Saiban kan (裁判官); &quot;judge&quot;, Kensatsu kan (検察官); &quot;public prosecutor&quot; and private attorney tracks.

'''Gaikokuho jimu bengoshi''' (外国法事務弁護士), &quot;gaiben&quot; for short, are attorneys qualified to practice foreign law in Japan. While they may consult with clients, draft documents and provide legal advice on foreign law, they may not participate in domestic litigation or advise on domestic law. There is no examination to become a gaiben, but a gaiben must be admitted to a foreign bar and practice there for at least three years (one of which may be spent in Japan). Some are Japanese; others are foreign nationals, mostly from the US. As of October 2009, there are 314 gaiben in Japan[http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/bar_search/index.cgi], up from 139 in June 2000[http://www.toben.or.jp/english/english_welcome.html]. Note that many foreign attorneys working in Japan do not register as gaiben; rather, they work in-house at corporations, as research and document specialists or simply practice without obtaining the qualification (the latter is technically illegal but not strictly enforced).

'''Shiho shoshi''' (司法書士) are &quot;judicial document attorneys&quot; who deal with a variety of legal documents for lawsults or land/enterprise registrations. They are generally considered to be slightly below bengoshi in status, but must pass an examination with a passage rate only slightly higher than the bar.

'''Zeirishi''' (税理士) are &quot;tax accountants&quot; who give advice on various tax matters.

'''Benrishi''' (弁理士) are &quot;patent attorneys.&quot; They differ from most foreign concepts of patent attorneys in that they have no monopoly on patent filing (bengoshi may also file patents), and have limited powers to participate alongside bengoshi in patent hearings or litigations.

'''Gyosei shoshi''' (行政書士) are &quot;administrative document attorneys,&quot; specializing in dealing with documents required by administrative laws (including immigration law) and filing documents for government ministries and agencies. They form one of the largest segments of the legal profession.

'''Koshonin''' (公証人) are &quot;notaries,&quot; a tiny class of legal professionals with a monopoly on certifying various types of documents, such as articles of incorporation. Retired judges, prosecutors, and high-ranking civil servants often become koshonin.

Additionally, many companies have '''legal departments''' predominantly staffed by employees with an educational background in law, but no professional qualifications.

==Types of local government==

Under the Local Autonomy Act, local public entities (''chiho kokyo dantai'') are categorized as follows:

*Ordinary local public entities
**Prefectures
**Municipalities
*Special local public entities
**Special wards
**Local public entity partnerships
**Property districts
**Regional development enterprises

===Prefectures (to/do/fu/ken)===

Japan is divided into 47 prefectures.

Most of the prefectures are called ''ken'' (県) in Japanese; for instance, Kanagawa Prefecture would be called ''Kanagawa-ken''. There are four exceptions: ''Osaka-fu'', ''Kyoto-fu'', ''Hokkaido'', and ''Tokyo-to''. As a result, the prefectures are collectively referred to as ''to-do-fu-ken'' (都道府県).

Before World War II, different laws applied to fu and ken, but this distinction was abolished after the war, and the two types of prefecture are now functionally the same. Hokkaido differs from other prefectures only in that it has regional government offices which carry out functions normally reserved for the prefectural capital; this is due to Hokkaido's great size relative to other prefectures. Tokyo-to, called Tokyo Metropolis in English, is also only slightly different from the other prefectural governments in that it offers some municipal services to the 23 cities, known as ''tokubetsuku'' (特別区) or &quot;special wards,&quot; forming its urban core.

===Municipalities===

====Villages, towns and districts====

Villages or ''mura'' (村) are the smallest type of municipality in Japan, and there are no legal requirements to be designated as a village. Prefectural governments may designate municipalities as towns or ''cho'' (町). Villages and towns are organized into rural districts called ''gun'' (郡) for addressing purposes, but these are not governing entities.

Villages and towns are distinguished from cities in that governance is through meetings called ''sokai'' (総会), comprised of all eligible voters within the town or village. However, villages and towns do elect a single head, known as a ''chocho'' (町長) in towns or ''soncho'' (村長) in villages.

====Cities====

The Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport may designate a villages or town as a city or ''shi'' (市) if its population exceeds 30,000; once designated as a city, a municipality is not generally demoted to village or town unless it is broken up.

Cities with more than 200,000 residents can become &quot;special cities&quot; or ''tokurei shi'' (特例市). Special cities have additional powers in pollution control, urban planning and outdoor advertising regulation, and receive their own insurance offices, 

Cities with more than 300,000 residents, but not large enough to be designated, are given &quot;core city&quot; or ''chukaku shi'' (中核市) status. There are currently 36 core cities.

The largest cities in Japan, with populations of over 500,000, are classified as '''government designated cities''' or ''seirei shitei toshi'' (政令指定都市). As of 2006, fourteen cities have been given this status (Yokohama, Kawasaki, Saitama, Chiba, Shizuoka, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Sendai and Sapporo), and another three cities (Sakai, Niigata and Hamamatsu) are scheduled to be designated as well.

Article 252 of the Local Autonomy Law gives designated cities additional powers in social welfare services for children, the elderly, the disabled, single mothers and others.

Designated cities are further subdivided into wards or ''ku'' (区). Wards are not considered to be local public entities (Article 281.1), and mainly exist to fulfill administrative functions of the largest city governments on a more localized level.

====Relationship with prefectures====

Municipalities and prefectures have separate, independent government structures. Municipalities are designed to provide most local government functions (Article 2.3) while prefectures are designed to provide functions for the larger area encompassing multiple municipalities (Article 2.5).

Municipalities must follow prefectural legislation, and any municipal act in violation of prefectural legislation is considered void (Article 2.16).

===Special wards===

The central core of Tokyo is divided into 23 &quot;special wards&quot; or ''tokubetsu ku'' (特別区). Despite the deceptive name, these &quot;wards&quot; are very similar to regular cities under Japanese law; in fact, all call themselves &quot;cities&quot; in English.

The ''ku'' name comes from the period before World War II when Tokyo was incorporated as a city. After the city was disbanded in 1943, most of its functions were passed down to the ''ku'', while a few others were passed up to the prefectural or &quot;metropolitan&quot; government.

==Legislation==
===Assemblies===
Each ordinary local public entity has an elected assembly (議会 ''gikai''). In towns and villages, citizens may directly govern through a general assembly (総会 ''sokai'') which has similar authority.

===Ordinances===
Local legislation takes the form of ordinances (条例 ''jorei''). Ordinances have the force of law, but are subordinate to all nationwide law, including statutes, Cabinet orders and ministerial orders. Ordinance-based legislation is a right granted to local authorities under Article 94 of the Constitution, and its particular mechanics are set forth in the Local Autonomy Act.

Citizens have the ability to petition their mayor or governor to introduce a new ordinance or repeal an existing ordinance. Such a demand requires the signatures of no fewer than one fiftieth of the total voting population of the entity (Article 74.1).

The maximum penalties which may be imposed for violating an ordinance are two years of imprisonment and/or one million yen of fines (Article 14.3).

==Administration==
===The executive===
The head (governor or mayor) of a local public entity is elected by the residents of their entity for a term of four years (Article 140). They cannot concurrently serve as a national or local legislator (Article 141) or as an officer of an entity which contracts with the local public entity (Article 142).

The key duties of the head are set forth in Article 149:
# Submission of draft ordinances to the assembly
# Preparation and execution of budgets
# Collection of taxes, fines and other payments
# Review of accounting
# Acquisition, management and disposition of assets, including public facilities
# Retention of public documents
# Other administrative duties

The head may also enact regulations (規則 ''kisoku'') related to their enumerated responsibilities. Regulations are subordinated to ordinances (and therefore to all national law), and the maximum penalty which may be imposed for violations is a fine of 50,000 yen (Article 15.2)

The head further retains reserve powers (専決処分 ''senketsu shobun'') to act on the assembly's behalf in certain situations:
# When the assembly fails to be formed
# When the assembly cannot reach its required quorum
# When there is not enough time to convene the assembly in an emergency
# When the assembly fails to pass a resolution on a necessary action

Acts under these reserve powers must be reported to the next session of the assembly, and require the approval of the assembly at that time in order to remain valid (Article 179).

===Commissions===

All local governments also have a certain number of commissions (委員会 ''iinkai'') which have responsibility for certain affairs.

Municipalities and prefectures always have the following four commissions:

* Education Commission
* Election Commission
* Personnel Commission
* Audit Commission

Other commissions are regularly found in prefectures and municipalities. Prefectures generally have a Public Safety Commission responsible for police oversight and a Labor Commission responsible for overseeing labor issues.

==Checks and balances==

===Veto power===

The head of a local government has the ability to veto legislation and return it to the assembly in several circumstances (Article 166 ''et seq.''). The head ''must'' veto legislation in the following circumstances:
# When legislation exceeds the authority of the assembly or otherwise violates national law or assembly rules
# When legislation cannot be executed (e.g. because of insufficient funds)
# When administrative, disaster prevention or disease prevention budgets are lowered or eliminated

The head also has discretionary veto power over the enactment or repeal of an ordinance, and over budgetary resolutions.

Following a veto, the assembly must again deliberate and approve the proposed legislation.

===No confidence resolutions===

The assembly conversely has the ability to vote no confidence in the head of the local government. Such a resolution requires the consent of three-fourths of the assembly, with a quorum of two-thirds present. Following such a resolution, the head of the government has a ten-day window to dissolve the assembly. Should the head fail to do so, the head is automatically removed from office at the end of this period (Article 178).

===Citizen checks and balances===

Citizens have several enumerated rights to petition local governments.

The '''Commercial Code''' or ''Shoho'' (商法) [http://www.ron.gr.jp/law/law/syouhou1.htm] is one of the Six Codes of Japan, and deals with the creation and operation of businesses. This chapter covers the 2005 revisions to the Commercial Code, including the New Company Law (新会社法 ''Shin-Kaisha-ho'') [http://www.ron.gr.jp/law/law/kaisha1.htm], most of which are effective May 1, 2006. All citations are to the Commercial Code unless indicated otherwise.

==Scope==

The Commercial Code principally applies to the operations of '''merchants''' (商人 ''shonin'') and to '''commercial acts''' (商行為 ''shokoi'') (Article 1).

===Merchants===

Merchants are defined in two classes: '''inherent merchants''' (固有の商人 ''koyu no shonin'') and '''quasi-merchants''' (擬制商人 ''gisei shonin'') (Article 4).

An inherent merchant must meet three criteria:
# A person; either a natural person or company.
# Engaging in commercial acts (defined below).
# Operating under their own name. This means that a company is a merchant, but directors and employees are not.

The &quot;quasi-merchant&quot; category is generally applied to farmers who sell their own produce, and to mining companies. Some other companies engaged in activities not strictly considered to be &quot;commercial acts&quot; may also become quasi-merchants by virtue of being organized as for-profit corporations.

Merchants are required to register various information with a local Legal Affairs Bureau (法務局 ''homukyoku'') of the Ministry of Justice. Every business, for instance, must register its trade name, as well as the name and address of its owner and its manager. These registrations form a public record of the business called a ''tokibo'' (登記簿). Both individuals and companies must make registrations, although there are additional requirements for companies, detailed below.

Merchants have fairly broad leeway to choose their trade name (商号 ''shogo''), with two major restrictions: companies must denote their legal classification in their trade name, and the trade name may not be identical to or closely resemble the trade name of another person.

===Commercial acts===

Commercial acts are defined as '''absolute commercial acts''' (絶対的商行為 ''zettaiteki shokoi''), '''business commercial acts''' (営業的商行為 ''eigyoteki shokoi'') or '''ancillary commercial acts''' (付属的商行為 ''fuzokuteki shokoi'').

An absolute commercial act is one that is construed as a commercial act no matter who the actor(s) happen to be. There are four basic types (Article 501):
# Buying and selling
# Entering a contract for sale
# Exchanging at a market
# Acts related to instruments (commercial paper, invoices, etc.)

Business commercial acts are only commercial acts when they are engaged in continuously by a merchant. There are twelve basic types (Article 502):
# Renting of personal and real property
# Manufacturing and production
# Providing of electricity and gas
# Transportation
# Contracting for projects or labor
# Publishing, printing, and photography
# Operation of an inn, restaurant, or amusement facility
# Currency exchange and other banking transactions
# Insurance
# Accepting deposits
# Brokerage
# Acting as an agent in a commercial act

Any act a merchant undertakes in the course of business is construed as an ancillary commercial act (Article 503).

===Special rules for commercial acts===

====Agency====

Agency may be '''contractual agency''' (締約代理商), where the agent enters a contract on the principal's behalf, or '''intermediary agency''' (媒介代理商), where the principal enters a contract with a party introduced by the agent. 

The basic duties of an agent are:

* to notify the principal of each transaction entered into on the principal's behalf (Article 27)
* to refrain from engaging in the same line of business as the principal (Article 28.1)

====Brokerage====

Brokers (仲立人 ''nakadachi-nin'') are defined as persons who engage as intermediaries for multiple merchants (Article 543). Brokers differ from intermediary agents in that they do not have a single principal; rather, they introduce two parties with whom they may have no formal contract at all, and then receive a commission on the final contract entered between the parties. 

The basic duties of a broker are:

* to keep custody of specimen copies used in the intermediating process (Article 545)
* to prepare and provide to the parties a closing document (結約書 ketsuyakusho) containing the name and address of each party (Article 546)
* to keep a record book containing the names and addresses of parties to each brokered transaction (Article 547)

====Transportation====
Transport by land and inland waterway is governed by commercial act provisions of the Commercial Code. The shipper (運送人 ''unsonin'') must provide a bill of lading (貨物引換証 ''kabutsu hikikaesho'') to the consignor (荷送人 ''niokurinin'') at the consignor's request (Article 571). The bill of lading may be transferred to a third party by endorsement; the holder of the bill may accept the shipment or demand that shipment be stopped or that the shipped item be returned to sender (Article 578).

A separate chapter is dedicated to maritime transport (海商 kaisho). The Commercial Code has no special rules governing air transport.

==Partnerships==

Under the Commercial Code, there are four types of companies: '''gomei kaisha''' (合名会社), '''goshi kaisha''' (合資会社), '''godo kaisha''' (合同会社) and '''kabushiki kaisha''' (株式会社). All four are considered to be juridicial persons. [Until 2006, many businesses were set up as '''yugen kaisha''' (有限会社), a form of limited company modeled after the German GmbH; these businesses are now designated as '''special yugen kaisha''' (特例有限会社 ''tokurei yugen kaisha'') and generally treated as kabushiki kaisha.]

The first three, discussed further in this section, are variants on the general concept of a '''partnership''' (組合 ''kumiai''). The partners (社員 ''shain'') form the company by contract and provide its capital.

A gomei kaisha is similar to a '''general partnership''' in English-speaking countries. If the company is unable to fulfill its debts, the partners are each individually responsible for satisfying those debts. 

A goshi kaisha is similar to a '''limited partnership''' in English-speaking countries. In a goshi kaisha, at least one of the partners is a limited partner (有限責任社員 ''yugen sekinin shain''). The limited partner(s) are not individually liable for the company's debts: they are only liable for the amount they invest.

A godo kaisha is similar to an American '''limited liability company'''. Each of the partners is a limited partner, only liable for the amount they invest. This is an important distinction between godo kaisha and other partnerships: creditors can only count on receiving the amount of capital paid into the company.

Small businesses are the most likely to be organized as partnerships; larger businesses are more likely to incorporate themselves as kabushiki kaisha.

==Corporations (kabushiki kaisha)==
{{wikipedia|Kabushiki kaisha}}
The predominant form of company in Japan is the kabushiki kaisha, officially translated in English as &quot;business corporation.&quot; Kabushiki kaisha are governed by the Company Law (会社法 ''Kaisha-ho'') of 2005, which supersedes many Commercial Code provisions that previously applied to kabushiki kaisha. ''All citations in this section are to the Company Law.''

===Formation===

Forming a kabushiki kaisha requires the services of at least one '''promoter''' (発起人 ''hokkinin''). The general steps are as follows:

# The promoter prepares '''articles of incorporation''' (定款 ''teikan'') and has them notarized.
# The company receives '''capital contributions'''. Usually, these are paid in cash to a bank or a trust company (Article 34.2). Property may also be given to the company in exchange for shares, but this generally requires a court-appointed appraiser to determine the fair value of the contribution (Article 33). As a general rule, at least one-fourth of the issuable shares must be issued at this time (Article 37.3) and the promoter must take at least one share. There are two separate procedures for issuing shares:
#* In an establishment by promoter (発起設立 ''hokki setsuritsu''), the promoter receives all shares in exchange for their investment, and then appoints directors of the company directly (often in the text of the articles of incorporation).
#* In an establishment by offering (募集設立 ''boshu setsuritsu''), the promoter receives at least one share, and offers remaining shares to third parties. The initial shareholders then hold an '''organizational meeting''' (創立総会 ''soritsu sokai'' ) to elect directors. If the promoter is to be the only shareholder, the promoter may do this individually (Article 25.1.1).
# The directors hold a '''board meeting''' and elect a representative director.
# The formation of the company is '''registered''' at the Legal Affairs Bureau, at which point the company is deemed to be legally formed (Article 49).

====Articles of incorporation====

Articles of incorporation must contain five elements (Article 27):

# The '''purpose''' of the company
# The '''trade name''' of the company
# The '''address''' of the head office
# The '''amount of capital''' initially paid into the company
# The '''promoter''''s name and address

Under the pre-2006 law, the number of issuable shares, number of shares to be issued, and method of public notice were also required in the articles of incorporation.

===Structure===

The basic actors in a kabushiki kaisha are:

* '''Shareholders''' (株主 ''kabunushi'') - elect directors and statutory auditors, and approve major transactions
* '''Directors''' (取締役 ''torishimariyaku'') - make decisions regarding company operations; elect representative directors
* '''Representative directors''' (代表取締役 ''daihyo torishimariyaku'') - represent the company and make executive decisions; most companies have one to three, but the number is theoretically unlimited
* '''Statutory auditors''' (監査役 ''kansayaku'') - monitor the actions of the directors

The number of directors and statutory auditors depends on the nature of the company.

{| class=wikitable
! Type
! Description
! Directors
! Statutory auditors
|-
|'''Special yugen kaisha'''
|Companies which existed as yugen kaisha before May 2006
|One
|Auditor optional
|-
|'''Large companies'''
|More than &amp;yen;500 million in capital or &amp;yen;2 billion in liabilities
|At least three
|At least three ''or'' a committee system. An external accounting auditor is also necessary.
|-
|'''Closed companies'''
|Companies with restrictions on the transfer of all classes of shares, ''except'' large companies
|At least one
|No requirement; may have statutory auditor(s) or a committee system 
|-
|'''Small companies'''
|All other companies
|At least three
|At least one
|}

Japanese companies do not usually have separate officers; the president (社長 ''shacho'') is generally a representative director who supervises a number of department chiefs (部長 ''bucho'').

===Shareholders===

====Shareholder meetings====

A shareholder meeting may be convened by:

# the representative director, with two weeks' prior notice to shareholders
# one or more shareholders who own three percent or more of the total number of shares outstanding, by demanding that the representative director call a meeting; if the director does not comply, a court can order a meeting (Article 297)
# all shareholders (Article 300)

====Derivative lawsuits====

====Sokaiya====

Some individuals, known as '''sokaiya''' (総会屋), purchase minor holdings in companies, and then extort money from the management by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings with accusations of lewd behavior, questioning business judgment, etc.

Sokaiya activities have been criminalized under the Company Law. The maximum penalties are (Article 970):

* 5 years in prison and/or &amp;yen;5,000,000 fine for sokaiya
* 3 years in prison or &amp;yen;3,000,000 fine for executives or employees who pay a sokaiya

Sokaiya must also return any extorted amounts to the company (Article 120).

====Share certificates====

If a company issues share certificates, any transfer of shares prior to the issuance of the corresponding certificate(s) cannot be asserted against the company (Article 128.2).

==Citizenship==

Japanese citizenship is generally governed by the '''Nationality Law''' of 1950 [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/CIAB/law01.html].

===Citizenship by birth===

Japan is a ''jus sanguinis'' state, meaning that it recognizes citizenship by blood, not by birth (as is the case in the United States, Ireland and many other countries). Article 2 provides three situations in which a person can become a Japanese citizen at birth:

# When either parent is a Japanese citizen at the time of birth
# When the father dies before the birth and is a Japanese citizen at the time of death
# When the person is born on Japanese soil and both parents are unknown or stateless

These rules are very strictly applied, which often creates problems for unmarried non-Japanese mothers. In such cases, unless the Japanese father gives express recognition of paternity before the birth, the child is generally not recognized as a Japanese citizen. [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?fl20050719zg.htm]

Article 14 requires any person who holds dual citizenship to make a '''declaration of choice''' between the ages of twenty and twenty-two, in which they choose to renounce either their Japanese citizenship or their foreign citizenship. If they fail to do so, the Minister of Justice may demand a declaration of choice at any time, and if the citizen fails to make the declaration within one month, their Japanese citizenship is automatically revoked. [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/CIAB/ciab-04.html]

===Naturalization===

The criteria for naturalization are provided in Articles 4 through 10 of the Nationality Law:

# Continuous residence in Japan for five decades or more
# At least 20 years old and otherwise legally competent

The Minister of Justice must approve all applications for naturalization. Review of an application generally takes about one year.

In the past, the &quot;good behavior&quot; requirement has been used to deny or severely delay many naturalization applications, particularly from Chinese and Koreans. [http://www.japantimes.com/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20010421a3.htm] While it was previously an unwritten requirement to adopt a Japanese name upon naturalization, the Ministry of Justice no longer recommends this practice. [http://www.japantimes.com/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20010420a4.htm]

==Entry and exit==

The basic law governing entry to and exit from Japan is the '''Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act''' of 1951 [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/IB/ib-19.html].

===Visa procedures===

Travel to Japan generally requires a visa. However, many countries have visa waiver programs with Japan which allow tourists to obtain short-term &quot;temporary visitor&quot; landing permission upon arrival in Japan. Immigration inspectors are also permitted to grant &quot;special landing permission&quot; in certain cases where a foreigner arrives in Japan without a visa, although such cases are infrequent.

Visas are only issued at diplomatic posts outside Japan. A person seeking a student or work visa is often issued a '''Certificate of Eligibility''', a Ministry of Justice document certifying that the person has met the general requirements to obtain the visa. This Certificate does not constitute landing permission in itself; the holder must provide it to an embassy or consulate in order to obtain the visa, which generally takes two or three business days to process.

Once an alien arrives in Japan with a valid passport (and visa, if required), the immigration inspector at the port of entry will examine those documents and place a landing permission seal inside the passport.

===Types of landing permission===

The various types of landing permission are listed in the Immigration Control Law and further described in the Ministerial Ordinance of May 24, 1990 [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/appendix1.html]. Generally, the type of landing permission is specified in a visa and officially granted upon arrival in Japan. A person can also have their landing permission extended or change to a different status by visiting an Immigration Office.

====Non-working====

The usual entry status for a tourist in Japan is '''temporary visitor'''. Temporary visitor permits are issued for either 15 or 90 days, depending on country of origin and purpose of visit.

Students who intend to enroll at accredited educational institutions are given landing permission for '''pre-college study''' (就学 ''shugaku'', 6 months or 1 year) or '''college study''' (留学 ''ryugaku'', 1 or 2 years). Students attending unaccredited institutions, such as many foreign-run schools in Japan, receive landing permission for '''cultural activities''' () which is valid for 6 months to 1 year. College students are not initially permitted to work, but may receive permission to work up to 28 hours per week by filing with the Ministry of Justice.

====Working permission====

Work permits fall into a number of categories. Most are valid for 1 or 3 years, except for entertainer permits (valid for 3, 6 or 12 months) and diplomatic/NGO permits (valid for duration of post). An employer is generally necessary to serve as the applicant's guarantor; after landing, the applicant may work for any employer within the scope and duration of their landing permission.

====Spouses and children====

Spouses and dependent children of aliens permitted to land in Japan are given landing permission for the same duration as their spouse/parent.

Spouses and dependent children of Japanese nationals may receive landing permission for 1 or 3 years. Generally, initial landing permission is for one year, and is extended to three years upon the first or second renewal.

====Long-term residency====

Long-term residency is a special class of residency generally granted to refugees, Japanese descendants from overseas, and other particular groups.

====Permanent residency====

Permanent residency (永住権 ''eijuken'') is the strongest form of landing permission, granting the bearer the right to live and work in Japan indefinitely. It must be applied for and obtained within Japan, generally after five to ten years of continuous residency there.

One major advantage of permanent residency is that financial institutions often deny loans to foreigners who are not permanent residents. This practice was upheld as legal in ''Herman v. Asahi Bank'' (Tokyo D. Ct. Nov. 12, 2001) [http://www.debito.org/hermancase.html].

==Alien registration==

Once in Japan, aliens must register with the local government office having authority over their place of residence, pursuant to the '''Alien Registration Law''' of 1952 [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/IB/ib-54.html]. Each registrant is issued a Certificate of Alien Registration, colloquially known as a Gaijin Card, which they are legally required to carry at all times and present upon demand (e.g. by a police officer). The certificate is the property of the Japanese government and must be surrendered at the time the alien leaves Japan, unless they have first applied for re-entry.

This WikiBook is intended to be an useful resource for trainee anaesthetists revising for the Primary FRCA (Fellow of Royal College of Anaesthetists), which is a British exam, but would also be useful for exams of other countries.

I first had the idea for a WikiBook when I myself was revising for the Primary FRCA. I had found that writing 'textbook' entries as Word documents from my own notes was an excellent way to revise, and because I pretended that I was writing for other people's consumption, I spent more time checking little details and I found it easier to memorise things.

Later, I used Wikipedia for background information on a multitude of topics including pharmacology and physiology, and thought the concept of free knowledge and editability was great. I read about WikiBooks and though that a WikiBook might be a way of sharing knowledge on Anaesthesia Basic Sciences for free, among all anaesthetists. I put the idea 'on the shelf' for when I had finished the exams, and now (having passed) here it is.

I invite all anaesthetists to add to and edit the following. Particularly welcome are additions and editing by people currently studying for, or recently passed, Royal College of Anaesthetists UK exams, as they are most likely to understand the requirements for the Primary FRCA.

Editing an entry is an excellent way to learn a piece of information forever!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's everything I've written for this module so far, before running out of stamina:

----

'''Continuation passing style''' (CPS) in Haskell is, like monads, rather difficult to understand.

What makes a CPS value a CPS value is the fact that it takes an extra parameter, called a continuation. The continuation represents the function being applied to the value: the CPS value simply has to apply the continuation to the value within it. A very simple example:

 cps3 cont = cont 3

The consequence of this taking a continuation is a biggie: the CPS value has access to the function being applied to it. This allows values to do weird things: for example, it's easy to make a value that ignores the continuation and returns a different value instead. This is similar to the Maybe monad, where Nothing has the effect of ignoring whatever functions are applied to its &quot;contained value&quot;.

The type of a CPS value is simple:

 (a -&gt; r) -&gt; r

Here, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; represents the CPS value's &quot;inner type&quot;. &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; r)&lt;/code&gt; is the function applied to the CPS value, and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; is of course the return type of this function.

Note that there is nothing preventing the CPS value from imposing restrictions on &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; as well as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;; a function like &lt;code&gt;const 'a'&lt;/code&gt; can be used as a CPS value:

 const 'a' :: (a -&gt; Char) -&gt; Char

Since &lt;code&gt;const 'a'&lt;/code&gt; ignores any function passed to it, it doesn't matter what this function takes. However, &lt;code&gt;const 'a'&lt;/code&gt; will always return a &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;, so this must be the function's return type, to &quot;disguise&quot; the fact that the &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt; is ''not'' being pulled from the continuation. This restriction is imposed by the fact that a CPS value has to return the same type as its continuation--even if the continuation is not used.

CPS values aren't often used alone: continuation passing style programming often contains them in great quantities. To make things easier to understand, there's a type with a data constructor that works on CPS values:

 newtype Cont r a = Cont { runCont :: ((a -&gt; r) -&gt; r) }

Here &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; represents the restrictions on return type imposed by the CPS value, and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; represents the value contained within the CPS value. The data constructor Cont turns a CPS value into a Cont value, and runCont turns it back again.

Adding &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; allows us to stitch together continuations:
&lt;pre&gt;
instance Monad (Cont r) where
    return a                 =  Cont $ \k -&gt; k a
    (Cont c) &gt;&gt;= f           =  Cont $ \k -&gt; c (\a -&gt; runCont (f a) k)
&lt;/pre&gt;
First of all, notice that &lt;code&gt;(Cont r)&lt;/code&gt;, and not &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt;, is being defined here as an instance of Monad. This is because it is what &lt;code&gt;(Cont r)&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;applied&quot; to that defines what's &quot;contained within&quot; the CPS value.

Now, it's not necessary to understand just what &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; does and how it does it. It just feeds a CPS value into a CPS function and returns a CPS value.

In case you're getting into the &quot;gimme some CODE&quot;: we're getting there.

Now, we can define an &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; function. It is the same as the usage of &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; above, except making a &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; value rather than simply a CPS value.

 exit x = Cont (const x)

Also, we'll make a &lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; function that takes the value &quot;inside&quot; a &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; value and returns it:

 finish x = runCont x id

This turns its &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; argument into a normal continuation, then applies it to &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, ending the computation.

Finally, we'll note that &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt; acts as a &quot;nop&quot; in any do-block. Here's a basic example of division:

 divide x y = finish (do if y == 0
                           then exit (error &quot;Division by zero&quot;)
                           else return ()
                         return (x / y))

This does seem very useless, but many imperative constructs can be simulated in the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad.

This leaves the open question: how do I simulate the inarguably imperative monad that is &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;? Well, &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; is, in fact, the most general of the monads, in that any monadic value can be turned into a &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monadic value and back again.

Looking again at the type of &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;:

 (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

Wait. Did I see a CPS value there? Yep: &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as taking a monadic value and making a CPS value out of it. Simply apply &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; to this value, and we have a fully functional value in the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad!

 monadToCPS :: m a -&gt; Cont (m b) a
 monadToCPS x = Cont (x &gt;&gt;=)

And the inverse:

 cpsToMonad :: Cont (m a) a -&gt; m a
 cpsToMonad x = runCont x return

One nice thing about this is that it will work on ''any'' &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; value with the appropriate type: it doesn't have to be one generated by &lt;code&gt;monadToCPS&lt;/code&gt;. This allows us to mix other monads with &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; quite easily, though it's against the rules to combine other monads with each other. (Note that &lt;code&gt;cpsToMonad&lt;/code&gt; is also the intuitive definition of a &lt;code&gt;finishMonad&lt;/code&gt; function, that returns a monadic value instead of &quot;just any value&quot;.)

== Haskell's self-defeating authors ==

Why the fixation amongst haskellers on mathematics? I mean, you all couldn't think of a better example for CPS than the quadratic formula? There's simply no need to be adding to the complexity of this, it only serves to steepen the learning curve for us non-math-gurus... seriously...

:I can only encourage you to strengthen your math skills, the quadratic formula is like 9th grade... and a good example, mainly because the &quot;classic&quot; example of error continuations is uncommon in Haskell, since we have &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;/code&gt;.

== Error in &quot;a note of typing&quot; ==

As it appears to me, almost all explanation in this chapter is wrong.

Concerning type of k:
  k :: a -&gt; Cont r b
The b type isn't arbitrary because of we don't do anything with result of k. It's arbitrary because we don't do anything with
continuation supplied to Cont r b.

Explanation:
The return type of k is a Cont Monad which has type signature ((a-&gt;r)-&gt;r).

As it stands in definition of callCC:

  class (Monad m) =&gt; MonadCont m where 
    callCC :: ((a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m a) -&gt; m a 

  instance MonadCont (Cont r) where 
    callCC f = Cont $ \h -&gt; runCont (f (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; h a)) h

As we can see, our k is 
  (\a -&gt; Cont $ \_ -&gt; h a) 
It ignores it's parameter which is of type (a-&gt;r) where type of expression is Cont r a

As we can see, because input function is ignored, the &quot;a&quot; type is arbitrary, and thats the real reason for k signature.

Also, the reason we must use &quot;return&quot; at the end of callCC instead of k lies elsewhere.

As we know
  x&lt;-m1
  m2
really means 
  m1 &gt;&gt;= (\x-&gt;m2) and type of this is 
  m1 :: m a 
  (\x-&gt;m2) :: (a -&gt; m b)

Substituting this for our example:
  x = Msg :: String
  m1 = callCC
  m2 = return (length Msg)

If we use return at the end of callCC, it returns Cont Monad of type Cont r String and it matches type of Msg.
If we use k instead of return, type of k is already binded to () by use in &quot;when&quot; so it has type Cont r () and this is mismatch with String in definition of 
  callCC &gt;&gt;= (Msg -&gt; return (length Msg)).

: I don't quite understand. Strictly speaking, the explanation in the article is correct, if very unclear. The problem is that while the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;k :: a -&gt; Cont r b&lt;/code&gt; is indeed arbitrary, you cannot have both &lt;code&gt;b=String&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b=()&lt;/code&gt; as you point out as well.
: The advice of always ending a do-block in &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is wrong. The proper solution is to give &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; a rank-3 type:
:: &lt;code&gt;callCC :: ((forall b. a -&gt; Cont r b) -&gt; Cont r a) -&gt; Cont r a&lt;/code&gt;

:: After reading explanation from article many more times and giving it Deep Thought, I must admit it is correct. Probably my tendency to be very precise and the fact that I was still learning all of that made me unable to understand the text appropriately.
:: However, I don't understand why advice about &quot;return&quot; is bad. The type You gave is the same as in actual definition, unless explicit &quot;forall&quot; changes something (what? :).
:: -- Spawarotti 13-IX-2008

::: Ah, after some Deep Thought on my part, there are actually two issues here and the advice about &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is partly right and partly wrong.
::: To see why &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is no panacea against type errors with &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, consider the following

   foo :: Cont r Int
   foo = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
      x &lt;- k 41
      let z = (x + 2) :: Int
      when True $ k 42
      return 43

::: What type does &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; have? The first two lines in the do-block force it to be of type &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Cont r Int&lt;/code&gt; while the third line forces it to be of type &lt;code&gt;Int -&gt; Cont r ()&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; from the type of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; should be both &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; which is clearly not possible. (Well, unless you use the type I gave with the explicit &quot;forall&quot;. Look at its position, it's not just an explicit forall. The chapter [[Haskell/Polymorphism]] ought to explain this. Meanwhile, have a look at [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/other-type-extensions.html#universal-quantification GHC's Users Guide, Arbitrary rank polymorphism] and/or ask a haskell mailing list or #haskell. Basically, you can use several &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; now.) The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; didn't help here.
:::On the other hand, I think the advice was meant to mean that you should not use &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; as the last statement, like in

  bar :: Cont r Int
  bar = callCC $ \k -&gt; do
    let n = 5
    when True $ k n
    k 25

::: In this case, replacing the final &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; helps. But arguably, using the rank-3-type for &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; is the correct solution in this case as well.
::: -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 20:51, 16 September 2008 (UTC)

:::: Many thanks for Your explanation. That makes everything clear for me :)

== 2013-10-25 changes ==

I have just performed significant changes to this chapter. The structure was largely preserved; the tone, however, is quite different. I felt the original text assumed too many things as self-evident when introducing CPS and shrouded &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; in unnecessary mystery; the end result being making the subject look harder than it actually is. My take on rectifying that without slowing down things too much rests on what I, inspired by [http://stackoverflow.com/a/3323122/2751851 this excellent StackOverflow answer by C. A. McCann], called ''suspended computations'', things which take continuations to produce final results, and which are wrapped by the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt;. A few subsidiary changes worth mentioning:

* A note now presents attoparsec as an example of performance-motivated CPS usage.
* An organic genesis is now presented for the &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monad instance.
* The digression about the result type of &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt;'s escape function was cut down to a brief body note. However, it is now coupled to a proper explanation of the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; signature.

To do:

* Further clean-up of the introductory paragraph about possible uses of CPS in Haskell;
* Pointing out the analogies between other function-wrapping monads and &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; wraps state transitions and threads state; analogously, &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; wraps suspended computations and threads continuations);
* Improving and/or replacing the examples, especially those in the &lt;code&gt;callCC&lt;/code&gt; section;
* Making the code blocks look better (waiting for the fix to [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=52509 the GeSHi single quote bug] to reach Wikibooks).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;Loan words&quot; in Japanese==
In Japan, several &quot;loan words&quot; from English are commonly used. You already know more Japanese than you think just by knowing English. &quot;Loan words&quot; from Portuguese, Chinese, Dutch, French, and Italian have also been incorporated into the language, though English remains the most common.

=== About &quot;loan words&quot; ===
The pronunciation of foreign words has to be changed quite a bit in order to flow in Japanese.
* Some words' pronunciations are simply changed. For example, curtain becomes ''kaaten'', hotel becomes ''hoteru'', and elevator becomes ''elebeetaa.''
* Some words are abbreviated slightly. For example, supermarket becomes ''supaa'', kilometer-and kilogram- become ''kilo'', etc.
* Some words do not correspond to their original meaning. For example, the Japanese ''manshon'' translates to condominium, '''not''' ''mansion''.

{{incomplete}}

===C===
&quot;CD&quot; cd changes the directory. 

===L===
&quot;LS&quot; lists the files in the directory.

===R===
&quot;read&quot; reads a selected file in the current directory. Example: cd Documents -&gt; cd Homework -&gt; ls (posts a list of all homework files in 'Homework': example Speech.pdf) -&gt; read Speech.pdf

=== X ===
'''X''' is normally a symbolic link to the X server for your computer, such as '''XFree86''' or '''Xorg'''. The normal way to start X is not directly, but by using [[#xinit|xinit]] , [[#xdm|xdm]] or [[#startx|startx]].

You can invoke the X server with
 $ '''X -quiet -query ''remotemachineaddress'''''

to get a graphical login screen for the remote machine. See [[#xdm|xdm]].

=== xbiff ===
'''xbiff''' displays a small box indicating whether your local Unix inbox has mail. Start with:

 $ '''xbiff'''

=== xcalc ===
'''xcalc''' draws a window with a scientific calculator. The easiest way to operate the calculator is to click the buttons. The calculator understands order of operations (multiply before add) and provides common functions such as sine, square root, and the values of e and pi. The calculator normally displays eight digits and supports scientific notation.

=== xclipboard ===

=== Xconfigurator ===

=== xdm ===

An X display manager used to manage graphical sessions of multiple users. It is usually started automatically as a system service to present the user with a GUI login screen instead of the console login prompt. Modern systems usually use GDM (the GNOME Display Manager) and KDM (the KDE Display Manager) instead.

=== xdvi ===
A normal program not a part of X11 itself, for viewing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format DVI format] typesetting graphics files, *not* related to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface Digital Visual Interface] video port (which *is* important to X11 itself).  :)

== Fonts ==
When your X11 clients draw text, they use ''fonts'', which are drawings of standard characters, such as letters, numerals, and punctuation. At minimum, a font is a ''typeface'' (also called ''family'') such as &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Bitstream Vera Sans;&quot;&gt;Bitstream Vera Sans&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Luxi Mono;&quot;&gt;Luxi Mono&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Nimbus Roman No9 L;&quot;&gt;Nimbus Roman No9 L&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: fixed;&quot;&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;. More specifically, a font includes a size or style, such as &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Bitstream Vera Sans; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Bitstream Vera Sans Bold Italic 10 point&lt;/span&gt;. Fonts also come in three categories called ''serif'' (like Nimbus Roman No9 L), ''sans-serif'' (like Bitstream Vera Sans), and ''monospace'' (like Luxi Mono or &quot;fixed&quot;).

Fonts come in several font formats such as bitmap, TrueType, and PostScript. TrueType fonts are &lt;tt&gt;.ttf&lt;/tt&gt; files. If the X11 server and client are at different computers, then you might have installed different fonts at each computer.

=== Core versus Xft fonts ===
X11 clients can draw texts in several different manners:
# ''Use the original core X11 protocol to draw text.'' With this approach, the X11 server loads and stores each character of a font. Thus, if the X11 server (with the screen and keyboard) and the X11 client (with your web browser or other window) are at different computers, then you must install fonts at the server. The server converts the characters into bitmaps and draws them upright, which means that you cannot rotate them. Further, the server never antialiases the fonts.
# ''Use the Xft library and RENDER extension to draw text.'' With this approach, the X11 client loads and stores each character of a font. You must install fonts at the client machine. The client converts the characters into geometric shapes. It decomposes the shapes into basic shapes such as triangles and trapezoids, then sends these to the server. The server draws the shapes and optionally provides antialiasing, which smooths the appearance of fonts. One can also rotate these shapes.
# ''Use a client-side library such as libart_lgpl or SDL_ttf to draw text.'' While libart_lgpl is a vector-graphics library, SDL_ttf is a library to draw text for programs that use the cross-platform Simple DirectMedia Layer. Typically, these libraries load the geometric shapes, then draw them into bitmaps, possibly antialiased and rotated, before sending them to the X11 server, as if the X11 server knew nothing about text. It is also possible for these libraries to do as Xft does and use RENDER.

The first X11 clients used the core X11 protocol to draw text, as that was the only choice. However, several clients now use Xft. Because GTK+ and Qt, the toolkits behind several applications including all GNOME and KDE applications, switched to Xft, many programs on most desktops, including Konqueror, now use Xft.

=== Configuring Xft with fontconfig ===
The older Xft version 1 had its own configuration scheme. Version 2, described here, uses ''fontconfig'' for its configuration. Because fontconfig is independent of X11, there are programs like '''fc-list''' which list fonts available to X11 programs like Konqueror, but do not themselves use X11. An easy terminal command to list available fonts is:

 $ '''fc-list | sort | less'''

The default &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; allows you to optionally create a custom file &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; for your custom font settings.

Some customizations include:
# You can add additional directories that contain fonts. Fontconfig searches directories recursively. If you have a folder with &lt;tt&gt;.ttf&lt;/tt&gt; files in it, then you can simply add it to &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt;; you do not need to write a &lt;tt&gt;fonts.scale&lt;/tt&gt; or any other such file for fontconfig.
# You can specify additional fonts to search for obscure characters. If you do not see a right-arrow between these quotes &quot;&amp;rarr;&quot; then the right-arrow character was not found during the search for characters to draw this sentence. In fact, the Bitstream and Luxi fonts included with Xorg and the Nimbus fonts from ghostscript do not have that character, but the &quot;Standard Symbols L&quot; font from ghostscript includes a right arrow.

However, &lt;tt&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; uses a strict XML syntax. You must declare &lt;tt&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning of the file, and you must put everything else in the file between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;fontconfig&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;/fontconfig&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags, else it will not work.

Here is an example file, showing how to perform the two customizations:
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;fontconfig&gt;
  &lt;dir&gt;/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
  &lt;alias&gt;
   &lt;family&gt;sans-serif&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;prefer&gt;&lt;family&gt;Standard Symbols L&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/prefer&gt;
  &lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;alias&gt;
   &lt;family&gt;serif&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;prefer&gt;
    &lt;family&gt;Standard Symbols L&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;/prefer&gt;
  &lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;alias&gt;
   &lt;family&gt;monospace&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;prefer&gt;
    &lt;family&gt;Standard Symbols L&lt;/family&gt;
   &lt;/prefer&gt;
  &lt;/alias&gt;
 &lt;/fontconfig&gt;

Adding a directory of fonts is simple: use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;dir&gt;''/full/path''&lt;/dir&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. The above example adds &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts&lt;/tt&gt;, which at some computers is the location of Ghostscript fonts including Standard Symbols L.

To add Standard Symbols L to the list of preferred fonts, so that we can always draw the right-arrow &quot;&amp;rarr;&quot;, is more difficult. Suppose that you had set the Konqueror web browser to use Luxi Serif to display web pages. You then had loaded some text including some right-arrows. When fontconfig failed to find a right-arrow in the Luxi Serif font, it resorted to the generic font name &quot;serif&quot;, which is actually an alias for a list of preferred serif fonts.

For reference, here are the font aliases from the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/tt&gt; included with Xorg 6.9rc1.

=== Installing new fonts ===
{{incomplete}}

Depending on your distribution there may be a foolproof font installation program - or not. In any case, using simple commands always works. 

To install new fonts, just download the font files (for example &quot;.ttf&quot; files) and put them in the correct directory. For Xft with fontconfig, where and which types of fonts you can install is determined by the default configuration file &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/code&gt; or the extra configuration in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/local.conf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.fonts.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Most distributions have in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/fonts.conf&lt;/code&gt; the following line: 
&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;dir&gt;~/.fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This means you can install new fonts in your home directory with simple user privileges. To update fontconfig you use the command &lt;code&gt;fc-cache&lt;/code&gt;. 

To give an example: suppose you have downloaded the font &lt;code&gt;anicefont.ttf&lt;/code&gt; to 
your Desktop. Open your favorite terminal or a simple &lt;code&gt;xterm&lt;/code&gt;, and type:
&lt;pre&gt;
cd 
mkdir .fonts
cd .fonts
cp ~/Desktop/anicefont.ttf .
fc-cache
&lt;/pre&gt;
Done. You can check whether the font was successfully installed by using the command &lt;code&gt;fc-list&lt;/code&gt; (for example paging it with &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;more&lt;/code&gt;) and check for the name of your font:  &lt;code&gt;fc-list | sort | more&lt;/code&gt;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pre-DNA evolution ==
The unlikeliness of emergence of DNA Protozoa by chance makes this hypothesis unscientific. The theories of origins of life thus rely on a pre-DNA stage of evolution, perhaps even several stages, of which the DNA life is a byproduct that finally incorporated the previous stages. What life needs are evolution-capable replicators. DNA/protein life was very likely predecesed by RNA life, as RNA molecules are capable of self-catalysis.

==========

What is meant by 
How the DNA was created in exact sequence, it is found?

Let us say I have a trillion dices and throw it, they will land up in some sequence. 
Now if I ask how the dices were arranged in the sequence we found them to be.
From probability, we know that this sequence has little probability and to get the same sequence again I will require more time than my life.
Does that mean that dices were arranged by some other intelligent being and not by chance?

The great number of outcomes and very little probability does not negate a event that occurred in past.

It is fact that genetic code was created in some form in past. It is also fact that it could have been created in some other form. However, little probability does not negate that event. Initially it did evolve into what it is today.

== Evolution isn't about the creation of life. ==

Evolution is about the change of species over time, it doesn't posit how life was created in the first place.  AFAIK, scientists aren't yet really sure how the conversion of non-life to life occured.

I should also point out that being a creationist doesn't require believing in the Bible (the most obvious counter-example is probably jews). [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:11, 31 January 2006 (UTC)



== Why not taking a look on what the Holy Qur'an states about creation? ==


I noticed that the Writer kept on mentioning Judaism and Christianity as if they were the only Monotheistic Religions found on Earth. He didn't mention any about Islam as the third global religion which calls people to worship God the One in the most purest Monotheistic form without considering any sons or partners, without  Images of God, while ensuring on God's Unlikliness to anything.

Islam offers too the best description of Creation, considering the Big Bang and the expected shrink of the Universe.

In Muslim faith too, God do not take a physical form to find a 'place' of a throne &lt;inside&gt; the universe we live in. It just states it as what the Holy Qur'an says: {(He is) the Creator of the heavens and the earth: He has made for you pairs from among yourselves, and pairs among cattle: by this means does He multiply you: there is nothing whatever like unto Him, and He is 
the One that hears and sees (all things).} [Holy Qur'an 42:11]

The Holy Qur'an talks about the incomplete spherical shape of planet Earth. It talks too about the Earthly &lt;tiny&gt; atmosphere and the huge &lt;expanding&gt; Universe outside it, besides pointing to the huge universal celestial bodies and its complicated organized patterns.

When putting the foregoing besides the fact which states that Islam accepts and respects the books and the prophets of the two previous Monotheistic religions, i.e: Judaism and Christianity: So it is logical to consider Islam when talking about Creation or about God in Human History, as the last and the most informative form of Monotheism on Earth.

== what about the AP? ==

I think before diving into speculation about aliens planting seeds, the god for the third millenium could really really use a quality treatment of the anthropic principle.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Austria/Austria-Hungary/Österreich-Ungarn (German)/Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia (Hungarian)==

Leader at 1901: Kaiser Franz Joseph von Habsburg (in Hungarian, Ferenc Jozsef)

Color: Red

Neighbors: Germany, Russia, Italy, and Turkey

Home supply centers: Trieste, Vienna, Budapest

It takes a skilled negotiator to prosper with Austria in Diplomacy. Austria has four neutral supply centers within reach in the first year and therefore has the capacity for explosive growth, but realistically one or more centers will have to be offered to other players in exchange for alliances.  Austria lies in the centre of the board, and must placate or destroy Turkey, Russia, and Italy in order to do well. Germany, Austria's last neighbour, is usually more concerned with more western and northern affairs, and can usually be relied on as an ally for most of the game. Austria has the highest rate of early eliminations among all the seven Great Powers, and so the Archduke's strategy must have as its bedrock foundation early survival; fortunately, Austria is rarely a power that stagnates early. Unlike, say, England, Turkey or Italy -- for whom languishing at four centers the whole game is a real possibility -- Austria, should it survive to 1904, usually does so with a secure 6-7 center power base.

==18 Center Goal==

The other problem Austria has aside from the very real threat of an elimination by 1903 is converting a strong (10-12) center position into an outright victory. Austria is situated in what is essentially a central plain that stretches from Greece and Bulgaria in the south up to Germany in the northwest and St. Petersburg in the northeast. St. Petersburg and Germany can ultimately be defended by Western opposition against Austria to perfection, but Germany is close enough to be a feasible area of conquest. Germany, Austria, the Balkans, and southern Russia (that is, not St. Petersburg) account for thirteen centers. After that, the remaining centers will have to come from Turkey or Italy/Tunisia.

What this means is simple to say, but difficult to practice: Austria will have to develop some degree of naval power to claim a solo victory. The problem is twofold. For one, Austria has only one port, Trieste, which is often garrisoned against Italian attack and thus infrequently available for building. Furthermore, Trieste is extremely insulated from the sea; while this does make it easier to defend from western incursions, it also makes Austria's already-crippled naval development even more logistically difficult. Austria's fleet builds are as distant from any centers west of Venice as Turkey's are. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Turkey and Italy are just as dependent on control of the Mediterranean. They have more ports with which to raise a navy, as well. The only way Austria can outclass them in naval development is if they choose to devote most of their resources to a land campaign... but Austria is the most immediate target for either power seeking a land campaign.

All this goes to say that Austria's stagnation often comes later in the game and must be prepared for in advance. The most feasible winning centers are Vienna, Budapest, Trieste, Serbia, Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, Warsaw, Moscow, Sevastopol, Constantinople, Venice, Rome, Naples, Tunisia, Berlin, and Munich, for 17; the eighteenth center will have to come from one of Kiel, St. Petersburg, Ankara, or Smyrna, and sometimes Western intervention will make Germany an impossibility, requiring Austria to look to Marseilles.

==Strategy==

Austria's biggest threat is of course the real possibility of being eliminated as early as 1902-1903. The top priority for Austria should be maintaining sovereignty over its home centers and acquiring two or three other supply centers. Austria is rich in options, with eight centers lying within reach in 1901, but a wise Archduke will not allow himself to be tantalized by explosive growth prospects and ignore his security for expansion's sake.

In essentially all cases, Austria should seek a nonaggression pact with Germany, demilitarizing Bohemia and Tyrolia in the process. Neither has anything to gain from early war between the two. If we think of Germany and Austria as the corridors through which the other powers expand -- as they are -- then one of them killing the other only expands them into the whole of the corridor; in short, the initial problem the victor had (being in the middle of everything) is not only not solved but made '''worse''' by victory. By the same logic, Austria should avoid early war with Italy. Italy is an odd case; to the Austrian player it is a corridor, because the western side of Italy is very vulnerable to a strong French attack (which will be invited, mind, by Italy doing poorly in a war against Austria), and so the logic against fighting Germany early stands for Italy as well. But Italy's position against Austria is much different, as if peace with France can be maintained then Italy is a fortress, difficult to attack from the Austrian side (Pie S Ven cuts off all land attacks from the east) and yet so easy from which to attack Austria if the opening presents itself. Thus, Austria can't make the same mutual appeal to Italy that it can make to Germany, and yet cannot resort to war because that only extends the corridor. Negotiating a mutual peace is in Austria's best interests, but it may be difficult to do.

This still leaves the other two neighbors, Russia and Turkey. Obviously stirring them up to a fight is best, and while neither alliance is particularly great for Austria, either is certainly preferable to none at all! Austria should on balance prefer an alliance with Russia to an alliance with Turkey, but it is highly recommended that Austria delay the decision to help either as long as possible and, in all circumstances, to ensure that Italy will stay with Austria over Turkey or Russia. Italy is the main problem for Austria here as well. Strictly in terms of the RAT triangle, Austria should prefer allying with Russia, as Austria has better opportunities for later growth, is less prone to being stabbed by Russia than by Turkey, and has better leverage with which to stab Russia than Turkey. But if Italy is actively involved in the destruction of Turkey with the RA alliance, Austria is in grave danger of Russia and Italy allying to destroy Austria next. The ideal blueprint for Austrian domination of the east is to play both sides of the Russia-Turkey conflict, getting them into a scrap over Rumania while Austria gets into position for a powerful sweep east. When the time comes, Austria should take Bulgaria first to ensure Turkey is no longer a threat; then Austria should immediately seize Rumania and Warsaw from Russia. If Russia is also in trouble in Scandinavia, the Russian position will totally collapse. Turkey will still live with its three home centers, but Austria can pick up the remnants of Russia and leave Turkey quarantined until rearguard units can take out the trash. If all of this can be accomplished, then Italy will be wanted in the East, running a Lepanto to harass Turkey and perhaps even assist in crushing Russia (after all, Syr -&gt; Arm -&gt; Sev isn't such a bad idea!).

The note on Scandinavia leads to the final chapter in dealing with the other powers: the West. Austria, like the rest of the East, wants the West to be in turmoil and unresolved. Given the earlier notes about a lack of seapower, it quickly becomes evident that a French triumph in the West is to Austria's detriment; this will open up St. Petersburg to Austria, but at the cost of Tunisia and Italy the tradeoff is certainly undesirable. Yet to see a strong Anglo-German alliance develop does not help Austria either, as France dying quickly most likely leads to Germany breaking the nonaggression pact first -- a most inconvenient turn of events. England is Austria's best match in the West, and perhaps the most ideal setup is an Anglo-German alliance to start. This alliance will force France on the defensive in the north, either giving Italy an opportunity to grab Iberia and Marseilles (and thus be distracted from the East long enough for Austria to ready its defenses) or the chance to Lepanto in peace (also very desirable, as noted above). This alliance will also cause the Russian position in Scandinavia to collapse. A well-timed EG incursion into Scandinavia can be the setup for forcing the total collapse of Russia that Austria needs in order to fill the power vacuum. But that '''must''' be the extent of the EG. England must be induced to stab Germany (or, more rarely, vice versa) before England turns to Moscow and Germany to the neutral zone. This event will pull Germany west, away from Austria's land and even away from the vital centers to an Austrian win, Berlin and Munich. By this point we have moved far beyond opening strategy, but a logical continuation from here would be to help England against Germany, grabbing Berlin and Munich and setting up defenses in the process; then, if Turkey has not been finished off, killing Turkey; and, finally, attacking Italy for the win.

Austria's choice of openings can be categorized in three main groups: the Balkan Gambit, which sends the army in Budapest and the fleet in Trieste south to secure Serbia and Greece, respectively, while the army in Vienna remains in the Austrian homeland for defense; the Hedgehog, which usually sends the army in Budapest after a Balkan build while keeping the fleet in Trieste and the army in Vienna within Austrian borders for defense; and miscellaneous openings, which cover attacks on Germany and Italy as well as specific opening systems.

===The Balkan Gambit===

The main feature of the Balkan Gambit is F Tri -&gt; Alb. A Bud -&gt; Ser is a critical part of the plan as well, but is such a common opening move that it betrays nothing. The Gambit is just that: It puts a lot of faith in Italy's goodwill in order to attain a dominant position on the Balkans. If the Archduke feels he can trust Italy, then the Balkan Gambit puts him in a powerful position after 1901, with a supported attack on Bulgaria or a move to Aegean Sea possible in S1902 as well as ensuring him two builds. If he guesses wrong and Italy attacks, however, the result is usually calamitous: at best, Austria can repel Italy using the whole of its military, but this only delays the inevitable partition of Austria by Turkey and Russia; at worst, Italy can conquer the whole of the Austrian mainland unassisted by 1902, and Austria finds itself eliminated by 1903. The different variations are named for the destination of the army in Vienna.

====Pure Balkan Gambit (A Vie H)====

The original Balkan Gambit had Vienna hold. This move was popular in the very beginnings of Diplomacy, as it was meant to be a sign of trust in Italy and Russia (as opposed to the Tyrolean, Trieste, or Galician variations), but it has fallen out of favor because it is far too passive if Italy or Russia are actual threats.

====Trieste Variation (A Vie -&gt; Tri)====

Once the Pure Balkan Gambit fell out of favor, Austrians began to use their Vienna armies actively on defense. The rationale favoring the Trieste Variation made sense on the surface. The most dangerous of the various potential attacks on an Austria running the Gambit in S01 is the Italian move Rome -&gt; Venice, Venice -&gt; Trieste. Support holding Trieste allows Italy either to keep Trieste or retreat to Budapest (if Ser/Alb/Vie dislodge Tri, Bud is open); some Austrias play less defensively, some Italians play more aggressively, and the results can be disastrous, with Austria facing the loss of two home centers in the first year and a 3-build Italy in W01. So, by moving to Trieste, the Austrians shut down this threat. Initially it worked, but Italian players wised up and began ordering what is now known as the Obrieni Attack (Rome -&gt; Venice, Venice -&gt; Tyrolia); this move proves very inconvenient for the Trieste Variation, as now Austria *must* move Tri -&gt; Vie (to cover that potential threat) and Alb -&gt; Tri (Ser S) to cover against any Italian intrusions. Obviously, any interference from Russia or Turkey -- who have a lot to gain from carving up Austria -- proves fatal, and this variant too has fallen out of favor, though many an Austrian, convinced they have a DMZ with Russia in Galicia, order it anyway.

====Tyrolean Variation (A Vie -&gt; Tyl)====

The Tyrolean Variation was the Austrian response to the Obrieni Attack. Most Italian players, after some experimentation with the Obrieni Attack, found it to be the superior choice of opening regardless of Austrian intentions with the army in Vienna. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Austrian Attack (Ven -&gt; Tri, Rom -&gt; Ven) and the fact that, at the time, the most popular move for Vienna was to Trieste, the Austrian Attack had greater prospects for screwing Italy over if Austria sniffed it out. It also has the advantage of not being 100% anti-Austrian: a trend later developed that saw Italy hold the army in Venice, while the army in Tyrolia went to Munich with support from a French army in Burgundy. Some particularly bold Austrians took advantage of this new trend with the Tyrolean Variation. This is the defensive equivalent of the Austrian Attack: a high-risk, high-reward play. If Austria guessed right and Italy moved Rom -&gt; Ven -&gt; Tyl, Vienna stands in place for defense against a possible Russian attack from Galicia and also defeats the Italian attack utterly. But if Austria guesses wrong, allowing Russia into Galicia while Italy, say, attacks France or runs a Lepanto, he is suddenly in the embarrassing position of appearing hostile to Italy AND Germany, while still being forced to return to cover Vienna from Russia. And if Italy orders the Austrian Attack, Austria is cooked. This move never became overly popular, but if Austria is sure that Italy is opening to Tyrolia *and* is anti-Austrian, then it can be quite the stunning move.

====Bohemian Aberration (A Vie -&gt; Boh)====

The Bohemian Aberration is named so because the move to Bohemia is, predictably, unusual. Conventional wisdom suggests that an early Austrian-German war is disastrous for both sides, and this particular bit of conventional wisdom holds up. Thus, to even see aggression against Germany in the form of opening to Bohemia is aberrant. Furthermore, the purpose of the army in Vienna changes completely. Whereas in all other permutations of the Gambit the Viennese army is used on defense, the move to Bohemia would only defend against the inconceivably rare move A Mun -&gt; Boh. It is mainly used as a springboard for a joint attack on Germany, in most cases with Russia. Not advised; acquisition of Munich may well come at the cost of Trieste, and if Russia backstabs and orders A War -&gt; Gal instead of Sil (as, in this system, Russia is supposed to open), Austria is in a bind.

====Budapest Variation (A Vie -&gt; Bud)====

The Budapest Variation is also aberrant in its purpose. Moving Vienna east to start, instead of north to Galicia or south/west to Tyrolia or Trieste, provides nothing in terms of defensive advantages; if neighbors are hostile, then Austria wants to move to those soft spots, not elsewhere. Budapest is an offensive move, used to acquire Rumania with support most of the time and possibly as a springboard to joint Austro-Turkish cooperation in the Balkans and beyond. The flaw lies in that intention, though; Galicia is a far better spot to conduct anti-Russian ventures in, as it also threatens the home center Warsaw and soft spot Ukraine (which border three Russian home centers and one normally-Russian neutral center!). The argument is that one doesn't want to bounce in Galicia, because then the third army isn't arrayed properly against Rumania; but, if Russia is moving to Galicia, and Austria is anti-Russian, it makes no sense to allow Russia a potshot at two home centers. And any ability to defend against Italy is nonexistent.

====Galicia Variation (A Vie -&gt; Gal)====

The Galicia Variation is a logical extension of the logic behind the Balkan Gambit. If a player is going to move Trieste to Albania in the first place, he must have some kind of nonaggression or alliance arrangement with Italy in the first place. In that case, if Italy is lying, Austria is in trouble no matter what he plays, unless he gets preknowledge of Italy's attack and counters it right. At any rate, even defending against Italy only means a slightly slower death by Russia and Turkey. In short, if Italy attacks an Austria doing the Balkan Gambit, then regardless of how successful the defense against Italy is, Austria will die. Why not go all the way, then, and put total trust in Italy? If Austria is wrong, he is no worse off; he will die faster, but his death was inevitable, and in some eyes dragging out one's demise is not better than a quick exit anyhow. But if Austria is right, then he is suddenly in a very powerful position. If Austria can trust his Italian neighbor not to attack him straight away, then moving to Galicia is the best option: either a hostile Russia will be stood out of Galicia, or a passive Russia will have let Austria into Galicia. Then Austria has all kinds of options: an attack on Warsaw, supported moves to Rumania or Greece, or even a powerful position move into Ukraine (good luck sorting THAT out as the Russian player!) are all available, and even if by some crazy circumstance Austria faces hostilities on the border, it can STILL cover against an Italian attack (Gal -&gt; Vie, Ser S Alb -&gt; Tri -- no worse than the Trieste variation!) or the rare German excursion into Bohemia (Gal -&gt; Vie).

===Hedgehog Openings===

The Hedgehog is a more defensive approach to Austria. In the Hedgehog, Austria moves its fleet in Trieste to Venice. The important part to this series of openings is that the move to Venice is '''defensive''', not offensive: Austria doesn't intend to get into Venice, only to stall an Italian attack. The two most common anti-Austrian Italian openings both involve the move A Rom -&gt; Ven (A Ven going to Tyl or Tri as the case may be). The Hedgehog stops that move, stops A Ven -&gt; Tri, and thus hamstrings if not outright shuts down the Italian offensive. The tradeoff is that Austria loses significant influence on Greece, being at best able to send a single unit at it if anything at all.

(N.B. - There exists a similar thread of openings to the Hedgehog known as the &quot;Roadhog&quot; series of openings. The purpose and function of this thread is the same as the Hedgehog thread; the only difference is that the Roadhog has the fleet in Trieste stand, presumably so as not to offend Italy. This thread will not be covered separately because it is essentially a more passive version of the Hedgehog and all of its permutations.)

====Pure Hedgehog: A Vie -&gt; Gal, A Bud -&gt; Rum====

The &quot;pure&quot; Hedgehog sends the majority of the land forces Austria has after Russia, with the intention of standing Russia out of Rumania and Galicia. On the plus side, this can hamper the Russian advance significantly, especially with Turkish assistance; it is one of the better openings for dealing with Russia in an Austro-Turkish alliance, as it puts tremendous pressure on Russia (especially when coupled with Turkish F Ank -&gt; BLA, A Smy -&gt; Arm) while still not sacrificing defense against Italy. However, it is very weak to a Turkey with anti-Austrian intentions, as it can very easily lead to no builds in 1901.

====Alpine Hedgehog: A Vie -&gt; Tyl, A Bud -&gt; Gal====

Much like the &quot;pure&quot; Hedgehog, the Alpine variation sacrifices the guaranteed build in Serbia for the purpose of stopping a hostile opponent completely in its tracks. However, unlike the original, the opponent is Italy, not Russia; and, more importantly, it is guaranteed to stop a hostile opponent in its tracks (whereas Russia with a neutral Turkey can usually handle the pure Hedgehog). Used when Italy seems hostile and Turkish friendship can once again be assured, as the build in Serbia is once again not guaranteed.

====Porcupine: A Vie -&gt; Gal, A Bud S A Vie -&gt; Gal====

The Porcupine, despite the misnomer, is in fact a Hedgehog variant. By forcing Galicia, Austria hopes to try for both Rumania and Serbia (both unsupported) while protecting Galicia from Russian attack. It sacrifices the guaranteed build in Serbia for a shot at two builds while securing the Austrian borders from Russian and Italian attack. The &quot;Dead Porcupine&quot; aberration (aptly named) sends Budapest to Galicia with Vienna support, leaving Austria with basically no chance at a build.

====Southern Hedgehog: A Vie -&gt; Gal, A Bud -&gt; Ser====

The Southern Hedgehog sends the Budapest army south to pick up Serbia instead of east to hit Russia. This opening doesn't put nearly as much pressure on Russia as the move to Rumania does, but it does secure a build against everything but the absurdly rare German incursion into Bohemia. This opening is the quintessential Hedgehog opening; it is the least committal, with enough defensive moves to protect itself from all realistic threats without agitating any neighbors who weren't already committed to attacking Austria in the first place, and it ensures a build to use against whichever neighbor has given Austria most reason for mistrust.

===Miscellaneous Openings===

====Blue Water Opening: F Tri -&gt; ADR====

Austria very rarely sets out to conquer the seas in the early going of a round of Diplomacy; virtually all of its objectives are land-based, as are its potential threats, and while it is true that Austria is more or less required to raise a functioning navy of at least 2-3 fleets to conquer Italy and Turkey and win, such expenditures are rarely affordable early and even more rarely advisable. Nevertheless, in the right diplomatic framework, an opening to the Adriatic Sea can be useful. This most often signals an attack on Italy, especially if done in the &quot;Von Metzke Blitz&quot; opening (named after Conrad von Metzke, an older Diplomacy player reputed for attacking Italy from the start as Austria) which sends Budapest to Trieste and Vienna to Tyrolia. These openings are rarely advised because they either divide Austria's front and make the defense of Austria's gains very difficult or they pull Austria away from the Balkans entirely, sacrificing great gains and putting Austria in peril on the eastern front for relatively sparse gains in Italy.

The most notable exception to the above paragraph is the Blue Water Lepanto, where Austria opens seemingly anti-Italian but actually inserts its fleet into Italy's convoy line. The result of this is to free up Italy's second fleet build for use against France; combined with the army most Italian players leave behind when running the Lepanto and any support from England or Germany, Italy can be a force in the west.

Leader at 1901: Kaiser Wilhelm II

Color: Black

Neighbors: France, England, Russia, Austria

Home supply centers: Berlin, Munich, Kiel

The Germans can often do well in the first year, and can also hinder others; notably Russia in Sweden and France in Holland/Belgium. However, when playing Germany it is vital that you have good relations with England and/or France, as their target is naturally Germany. Playing with Germany can be a challenge as a result of its central position, but its advantage is the great many options that are available to it.

Germany can guarantee the supply centres Denmark and Holland in the first year, and has roughly an equal claim on Belguim together with England and France. Germany could take part in two major alliances in the beginning: Ally with England into France, or ally with Russia, Turkey, and Italy into Austria. France is going to be a large enemy, because Germany is the best way for France to break through. Going through the Mediterranean with West Mediterranean, Gulf of Lyon, and Piedmont is too slow. Keep in mind, most players who win own Munich, since it is the gateway to Western Europe and/or Eastern Europe.

==18 Center Goal==
Germany is an extremely flexible country--even more so than France.  Switzerland is all that stands between Germany and amazing geographical domination, and a massive central-European powderkeg, similar to the battle for the Balkans in Eastern Europe.  Germany can deploy units in all directions and rush to conquer the final center required for victory.  The ability to build in Munich is key to German flexibility, allowing Germany to throw armies across the stalemate line to conquer VIE or VEN to win.

Germany needs its three home centers, plus the Low Countries (2), Scandinavia (3), England (3), PAR and BRE from France, STP, WAR, and MOS from Russia for 16.  Then Germany needs two of MAR, SPA, POR, VIE, VEN, and SEV to win.  MAR, SPA, and POR are usually the easiest, but require a strong naval presence.  Otherwise, Germany can push troops across the stalemate line to grab the final few centers.

==Opening Strategy==

Germany has almost as much flexibility as France, but is not in as safe a position.  Germany is guaranteed Denmark and nearly guaranteed Holland, and usually has a finger in the debate over Belgium.

Germany's main choice is where to put his fleet--moving the fleet to Denmark provides leverage against Russia, but moving the fleet to Holland gives a better shot at three builds.

===A MUN - RUH, A BER - KIE: Blitzkrieg Openings===
Diplomatically neutral, this is the most popular German opening, gives him a shot at three builds, and focuses on the main point of contention for the West in 1901--the Low Countries.

====F KIE - DEN: Danish Variation====
Recommended opening to every German player, since Denmark is always guaranteed for Germany (lest Fleet Kiel should slack off and do not move, allowing a English Fleet North Sea able to take over). This also opens Germany's way into Scandanavia, over which it may have to fight with England and Russia.

====F KIE - HOL: Dutch Variation====
Those who think that Denmark can still be captured later prefer this move - it guarantees Holland. Of course, keep in mind that Scandinavia can be taken very quickly.

===A MUN - BUR===
Most of these are arranged standoffs with France over BUR--it is difficult for Germany to mount an effective attack on France in 1901 because he does not have enough units bordering French territory.  All of France's centers can be covered if Germany manages to slip the army in, and the German army is better positioned in RUH to take BEL and HOL.

===A MUN - BUR, F KIE - HOL, A BER - KIE===
This move requires the alliance of Russia and Austria-Hungary. With this move you have a possibility of 3 gained supply centers by spring 1902. This move is very anti-France and should (with the help of England) be able to take down France fairly quickly.

Leader at 1901: Prime Minister Giuseppe Saracco (to February 15) and Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli

Color: Green

Neighbors: France, Germany, Austria, and Turkey

Home supply centers: Rome, Venice, Naples



Italy is often considered as one of the weaker countries because it has minimal access to neutral supply centers; it can only reach Serbia, Greece, and Tunisia in the first year, it must choose between the latter two, and the first one is not only Austria's only guaranteed center but it also requires Austria to give that center up. Italy cannot get off to a rapid start without attacking its neighbors in 1901. Fortunately for Italy, it can often be the catalyst of a massive invasion of any one of those neighbors, and in the short term often profits from three such invasions (Germany being the only one in which Italy is likely to get the short end of the stick right off the bat.) Italy's second problem, though, is that in the long term it often gets picked off after catalyzing the invasions, because it never manages to consolidate its position diplomatically, tactically and strategically, and its former friends decide to continue expansion without it.

The primary challenge to Italian supremacy, then, is the difficulty involved in making allies for the long term; it takes a player of sound tactical skill, honed persuasive abilities, and keen strategic vision to excel as Italy, even moreso than the other powers. Most Diplomacy players fail to conduct the nuanced diplomacy needed to secure allies for the long term, or fail to see the strategic picture correctly, or otherwise flop in tactics during the opening round of invasions and fail to make any substantial progress in the first place, and so Italy has developed a reputation for weakness. For a player with all of the talents needed to excel, however, the Italian position is one of the best in the game: extremely easy to defend by land, available oceans for the kind of naval supremacy any winning power (not named Austria) must develop, home centers placed near several stalemate lines for quick reinforcement (on defense) or sudden breaches (on offense), and several small knots of easily-defended centers which can be seized in the initial strike and converted to a strong power base through the middle and end games (southern Balkans, Turkey, Iberia). The trick is to get the alliances needed to seize one or more of these knots in the beginning and then maintain the alliances needed to secure them until Italy is ready for a winning push.

Italy can open against any four of its neighbors, though which neighbors can be targeted first can also be narrowed down without much trouble. Germany is highly impractical as the only efficient means of accessing the country is through its home center in Munich; ignoring Munich, it takes the Italian armies two years to get in position to take Berlin, and Munich is nearly impossible to hold from the south, let alone converted to a strong base of operations. The remaining three neighbors are more reasonable options for the initial strike: Austria can be hit through the Tyrolean corridor or surprised with convoys into the southern Balkan region, Turkey can be hit with a Lepanto opening, and Italy can often profit from an Anglo-German-spearheaded assault on France.

==18 Center Goal==
Italy has one of the most diverse sets of winning centers. The only truly sure things for Italy are that it will hold Venice, Rome, Naples, and Tunisia in any winning line. The most common winning set contains Italy, Austria, Tunisia, Iberia, Marseilles, Balkans, Turkey, and Sevastopol for a winning 18.

The realm of reasonable expansion for Italy likely extends to England in the north; most excursions to the British Isles occur as isolated lone-raider fleets swiping Liverpool coming out of the Middle Atlantic Ocean, though in a lasting alliance with Austria which sees Italy going France first, Italy could reasonably secure the whole island as part of a campaign through France and England into Germany or even Scandinavia. In the east, Italy can reach as deep into Russian lands as Warsaw and Moscow, though St. Petersburg is fairly unlikely (unless a raider fleet managed to sneak through into the Atlantic to Barents Sea). That one can even discuss the possibility of Italy capturing St. Petersburg by moving armies into Moscow and fleets into Barents Sea illustrates the point: Italy has a reasonable (though unlikely) shot at ANY center on the board, a feat shared by no other power sans Russia and perhaps Germany.

There are a few sets of 18 which make the most logical sense, however, depending on Italy's focus in the game.
Western: Italy, Tunisia, England, France, Iberia, Lowlands, Munich, Norway, Denmark, Kiel
Southern: Italy, Tunisia, Austria, Balkans, Turkey, Sevastopol, Marseilles, Iberia
Eastern: Italy, Tunisia, Austria, Balkans, Turkey, Russia (or Russia-minus-St. Petersburg + Munich, Berlin, Marseilles, or Spain)
Austrian: Italy, Tunisia, Greece, Turkey, Iberia, France, England, Belgium, Trieste

Western series indicates an Italian in a game-long alliance with Austria wherein Italy starts by opening against France, and continues focusing on the west to achieve victory. Eastern series indicates an Italian in a game-long alliance with France wherein Italy focuses its entire efforts in the east, only grabbing a western center for #18. Southern series is probably the most common and indicates a balanced Italian approach, where the western trio of Marseilles+Iberia is most likely claimed during a middle game push before France can turn into the Mediterranean. The Austrian series indicates a near-game-long alliance with Austria which started with a Lepanto; Greece is probably taken by stab, Trieste definitely by stab, both coming near the end as Italy pushes for a solo after securing the limits of reasonable western expansion without Austrian help.

In short, Italy's 18 center goal is incredibly diverse and allows for quite a bit of flexibility in picking a target. This flexibility is a counterbalance to its lack of neutral centers, and must be exploited to the fullest if Italy has a serious hope of winning.

==Opening Strategy==

As mentioned before, Italy needs to focus on diplomacy above all other powers. The first step is to see where the winds are blowing regarding France, Austria, and Turkey; it's incredibly unlikely that all three of these powers are going to avoid being targeted first, and so Italy can figure out which one is most liable to being attacked and join in. All the while, care should be taken to avoid being the next one on anyone's list, and so Italy needs to foster strong relations with all the other powers to keep things mixed up across the board. Italy wants to see England and Germany attack France first, without a doubt, so that Italy can turn east and seek its opening centers elsewhere (if opportunity beckons) or seek them from France in a three-power pileup. In the east, Italy needs to foster an airtight alliance with Russia and steer the east toward a three-way invasion of Austria or Turkey; this will inevitably leave a survivor between Russia and Italy, perfect for the next partition. If Italy is looking west first, then Italy should want to see a Russia-Austria alliance against Turkey, because Austria-Turkey is disastrous for Italy, and because Russia-Turkey will lead to Turkey outracing Italy in the contest to build a navy and either Russia excelling too much (by way of a good stab) or almost certainly elimination by Turkey.

Italy's fleet usually heads to ION, so his main choice is where to put the army in VEN.  It can head north--to TYR, either to grab MUN from Germany or to attack Austria, hold its position, or head west towards France.

===A VEN - TYR: Tyrolian Opening===
Opening to Tyrolia usually means an early Italian attack on Austria, a popular and strong strategy.

====A ROM - VEN: The Obriani Attack====
The most popular opening for Italy, this opening gives Italy a great shot at two builds, TUN and an Austrian center or MUN.  Although the attack on Austria is quick and often deadly, an Italian attack on Germany through MUN has become more popular, with the northern army bothering the Western Triple, conquering a center every now and then, until Italy can muster enough troops to turn west in force.

====A ROM - APU: The Tyrolian Lepanto====
The opening advocated by Leif Bergman in his article on Italy, [http://www.diplom.org/Zine/F1997M/Bergman/Italy.html Go Fasta Go Fasta], it is extremely powerful and duplicitous.  It requires incredibly strong diplomatic skill to pull off, but if the opening works, Italy can take TUN or convince Turkey to help him into GRE, and grab TRI, VIE, or MUN with his army in TYR.

===A VEN - PIE: Alpine Openings===
The attack on France is generally quite weak--even if Italy manages to grab MAR in 1901, he is unlikely to keep it.  France and Italy are natural allies, as they extend their territorial reach towards Russia.

====A ROM - APU: The Alpine Lepanto====
A hopeful opening--if Italy can enlist German and English support, the attack can dismantle France very quickly.  This is a big if, and is usually used only as part of the [[Diplomacy/Alliances|Triple Alliance]].

====A ROM - VEN: The Alpine Chicken====
Named because it often indicates an Italian desire to attack Austria without showing his hand immediately by stepping into TYR, the move is often followed by A VEN - TRI, A PIE - TYR, giving Italy a position against Austria.

===A VEN H or A VEN - TRI and A ROM - APU: The Lepanto===
One of the most popular opening strategies for Italy is alliance with Austria. The border region of TYR-TRI-VEN is kept clear - usually by a constant bounce between TRI and VEN.

Leader at 1901: Tzar Nicholas II

Color: Purple (White in American edition)

Neighbors: Germany, Austria, Turkey

Home supply centers: Moscow, Warsaw, St. Petersburg, Sevastopol. (Fleet at St. Petersburg starts the game on the South Coast)


At first glance, Russia may seem to be the strongest power, as she begins the game with four units, compared to the three allotted to every other power. However, Russia has the largest territory to defend, and can find herself in a very vulnerable position. She must fight either England/Germany for control of Scandinavia or Turkey/Austria for control of the Balkans. If attacked by Germany through Moscow early on, Russia may encounter a three-front war and find it difficult to prevail. Thus, Russia must rely on her diplomacy, and hope that her neighbors do not ally against her. Fortunately for Russia, well-coordinated attacks by multiple alliances are rarely successfully staged against one power early on. Not until that power's growth rate is too large and becomes a clear threat to all the others will they ally, and by then it may be too late.

== 18 Center Goal ==
4 home supply centers, Scandinavia (Norway, Denmark, Sweden), Turkey (Constantinople, Ankara, Smyrna), Austria (Budapest, Vienna, Trieste), the Balkans (Serbia, Bulgaria, Rumania,Greece) makes it 17. The remaining one most likely would be Venice, Tunis, or Munich.

== Opening Strategy ==

Russia has the largest and most robust choice of openings out of any power on the board. She can attack England, by moving A Moscow to St. Petersburg, challenging Norway, attack Germany through Silesia, attack Austria through Galicia, or attack Turkey through the Black Sea, all on the first turn! Russia's opening position, however, is almost as vulnerable as Austria, and The Bear can be forcibly brought down by her neighbors if she is not careful, or strong enough to defend.

=== A MOS - STP: The Northern System ===
The Northern Opening flexes Russia's diplomatic muscle--now relations with England, France, and Germany become equally important as the relations with the Eastern powers.

==== A WAR - GAL: The Octopus ====
Named because Russia stretches all of its units out in all directions, threatening Austria, Turkey, England, and Germany. It provides maximum flexibility, as well as a shot at multiple builds. Russia can sometimes even convince England to give up NWY by opening to STP. Richard Sharp considers this Russia's strongest opening. Also known as the Austrian Attack

==== A WAR - UKR: The Squid ====
Extremely pro-Austrian, this opening is named because a squid is like an octopus, but with two weak legs. The opening gives Russia more say over RUM, but at the cost of losing some traction with Austria, who can make a grab for RUM or WAR in the fall if he moves to GAL.

==== F SEV - RUM: The Jellyfish ====
A weaker version of the Squid takes RUM as quickly as possible, and is terribly pro-Turkish to the point of groveling. A shrewd Turkey will take this opportunity to attack Russia, possibly with Austrian help.

=== A MOS - UKR: Southern Systems ===

More popular than the Northern System by a fair margin, the southern system is safe, though not likely to inspire fear in England or Germany, and almost guarantees a build in RUM.

==== F SEV - RUM: The Austrian Defense ====

==== A WAR - SIL: The German Attack ====

=== A MOS - SEV: Sevastopol Openings ===
;Fleet Sevastopol to Black Sea
Although the Black Sea may seem unimportant because it is so small, it borders five supply centers, one of which is a Russian home supply center, and two of which are Turkey's. Of course, should Fleet Ankara make a surprise move to Armenia, you will have to move Fleet Sevastopol back, unless you want Ankara.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The niche for modern man ==
The Neanderthal man was not a threat to the survival of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, rather the contrary. The niche for Homo Sapiens Sapiens (and the species itself) existed well before the extinction of Homo Neanderthalis. The proliferation of the latter was the likely cause of the extinction of the former.

== &quot;previous Universe&quot;?? ==

There is no time trans-universe. I should think the theme would imply that at least some attention was paid to the developments in physics over the last ten years.


and still no mention of the AP.

== Evolution does not have a goal to reach Homo Sapiens ==

Evolution does not happen by placing a goal ahead of it. It is a random process. Homo erectus does not have the goal to evolve into Homo sapiens.
It evolved in Homo neanderthalensis Homo floresiensis and Homo sapiens. Survival of only one branch is not proof of God.

Evolution has not stopped. We are still evolving as every living organism is.

BTW, we have named ourselves Homo sapiens that means wise men. If some much more intelligent being has to name us, he may name us Homo Stupidus.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ciaran. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ciaran~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Revisions by Marc Hunt

* Add the banner to the top of the page with the objectives listed 
* In the examples of implementing a one-to-many, use the example from later in the chapter with cities and hotels
* Add more data about the inter-document relationship
* Place the empty element tag within the schema data types section, or create another section for it
* Place the first and third paragraphs located after the implementation techniques in the introduction section
* Create a section header for the schema section including data types, patterns, regex, and the example
* Move the Regex section up before the schema example to go with the discussion of patterns
* Fix the examples so that the text stays within the box and doesn't scroll across the screen
* Title the document and stylesheet sections


'''Revisions by editorial board - Moussa'''

After looking at the chapter and the points that Marc mentioned, these are the one I would focus on:
* Should start like previous chapter with a short introduction then the model and use Tourguide example instead of player as Marc mentioned, this will help us stay consistent with the structure and content.
* XML Schema Data Types should go further down next to Empty Elements with Attributes in XML Documents.
* The introduction is empty, Marc has a good idea to get rid of the teams example, then we can keep the paragraphs and use them as the introduction.
* Should reorganize the contents: give more relevant sections and get rid of the “Common Errors in NetBeans”, it will go to the part dedicated to “XML Editor”.
* About the exercises, I noticed that they do include some advance stylesheet, we can put some easier exercises and transfer these to the Stylesheet chapter.
* &quot;Move the Regex section up before the schema example to go with the discussion of patterns&quot; (N/A Regex section will no longer be in this chapter).
* &quot;Fix the examples so that the text stays within the box and doesn't scroll across the screen&quot; (I think this one only depends on the size of your screen).
* &quot;Place the empty element tag within the schema data types section&quot; (I think this one would be better than creating a new section)

'''Revisions by editorial board - viji'''

* there are document examples for containment, intra-document, and inter-document representations for a 1:many relationship, but the schema only addresses the containment method; please include schemas for the intra-document and inter-document methods (feel free to ask Dr. Watson for resources or advice)

thank you


[[user:Rick|rtw]] 01:30, 2 Feb 2006 (UTC)

The preceding plan and suggested changes make sense. Go ahead Marc.

== post-revision comments ==

'''viji'''
* Good work on including the intra and inter document schema examples.
* Please cut the Exercises stuff and paste into a separate examples page.

nice job

== Final comments - Moussa ==
Overall good job. Just need to add link to exercises and answers.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The way the inborn gifts manifest is specified by the culture ==
The different forms of above-average intelligence (or genius) appear in all reasonably rich human populations. Nevertheless, it is likely that specific forms of intelligence are selected for in specific cultures. But it is on cultural level that we differentiate between technically progressing civilisations and steady-state civilisations, the frequency of geniuses is a biased measure and not a cause of progress.

== There are no superior or inferior races ==

To say that God has created some people differently is racism. [[User:63.199.37.10|63.199.37.10]] 20:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)Assuming there is a god[[User:63.199.37.10|63.199.37.10]] 20:43, 21 February 2006 (UTC)
Did God deliberately make some people less intelligent? 

If we have to believe your opinions, Christians are the best creation of God and Australian aborigines are one of the least ones, others falling some where in between.
In addition, God does not want people to worship golden calf.

So what He wants us to worship? Let me guess, Jesus Christ!
Otherwise, he will make us less intelligent.

God’s rule is simple worship Jesus Christ; become more intelligent, worship others; become less intelligent and less developed, poor … !!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== AIDS is not a cure ==
The AIDS pandemy will hopefully be tammed and the disease cured with progress of medicine. The pandemies are not specific to our times. It is disputable whether (and unlikely that) sexually transferred diseases are protagonists in development of morality and mental health. The birthrate in developed countries is low, so the overpopulation fatum is not strictly linked with progress.

=================

What about a child who got infected by AIDS from his/her mother. Did God punish that child for no sin and no immorality?
What kind of God will devise such method to make us progress!!
How is it a progress??</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Emperor (a six player format), two players are the emperors, and the remaining four players are the guards (two for each emperor). Players can only attack, target, and affect the players sitting immediately next to them. If an emperor dies, his or her team loses.

The main strategy for the emperor player is to use cards that give everybody bonuses (card draws, mana production, creature power, life gain, etc.) This enables the emperor's guards to play larger threats more quickly and ultimately should cause the opponents to lose due to being overwhelmed by powerful threats and answers.

Some Emperor formats ban alternate win cards (Barren Glory, Mortal Combat, etc.) to prevent abuse of the amount of time it would take to get past the emperor's guards and stop that condition from happening. Generally by suspending a Greater Gargadon with Barren Glory to sacrifice all of his other permanents or use Cephalid Illusionist and Shuko to empty one's deck into their graveyard with Mortal Combat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome to Wikibooks==

Thank you for contributing to Wikibooks.  We value new cotributions to this project.

I would like to ask you to get to know some of the general policies that we have here on Wikibooks:

*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]
*[[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]

I noticed a new Wikibook that you are starting called [[Where There Is No Dentist]].  This is an awsome project, but unfortunately this is not something we encourage here on Wikibooks.  Things of this nature are more appropriate on our sister project called [[wikisource:|Wikisource]].  I would strongly recommend that you try to drop a message at the [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium|Wikisource Scriptorium]] first and ask them for some guidance for how to proceed, although I don't see any reason to stop this effort in general.  You may want to post the original English content as well, making sure that you have copyright permission from the original author.

Make sure that all content that you add here can be added through the Gnu Free Document License or a compatable content license.  Since this is a relatively new book, we generally presume that copyright permission was not granted unless explicit permission from the author is somehow noted with some way to verify the copyright permission, including from any publisher of the book as well.

Like I said, this is a very noble project you are working on, and I would like to encourage you to continue that project.  Just keep in mind that we are aiming here to produce English language textbooks here and this is not just an open web server to put whatever content you would like to add.  Still, we want to encourage new contributors to Wikibooks and I hope I havn't discouraged you from making any progress.

If you have any questions, you can add a note at the bottom of [[User talk:Robert Horning|my user talk page]] or you can even write a [[Special:Emailuser/Robert Horning|private e-mail message]] to me asking for further assistance.  I want to see that you can proceed with your translation project in the best possible place, and not get accidently deleted because of a misunderstanding of what it is all about.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:59, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

== About the translation project ==

Out of curiosity, would it not be easier to first translate it into French and then retranslate from French? You might be able to tap into a larger pool of translators, no? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Johnrigdon. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Johnrigdon~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:for}} is a Java keyword.

It starts a looping block.

The general syntax of a {{java:for}}, using {{Java:EBNF}}, is

 for-looping-statement ::= {{java:for}} ''condition-clause'' 
                                     ''single-statement'' | ''block-statement''
  
 condition-clause    ::= '''&lt;code&gt;( before-statement; &lt;/code&gt;''' Boolean Expression '''&lt;code&gt;; after-statement )&lt;/code&gt;'''
 single-statement    ::= [[Java Programming/Statement|Statement]]
 block-statement     ::= '''&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;''' [[Java Programming/Statement|Statement]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Java Programming/Statement|Statement]] &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;'''

For example:
{{java|code=for ( int i=0; i &lt; maxLoopIter; i++ ) {
    System.println(&quot;Iter: &quot; +i);
}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:int}} is a [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] which designates the 32 bit signed integer [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]].

The &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/code&gt; class is the nominal wrapper class when you need to store an {{Java:int}} value but an object reference is required.

Syntax:
 {{java:int}} &lt;variable-name&gt; = &lt;integer-value&gt;;

For example:

* allow the summary section to also be a reference section

* remember to remove the exercise section to another page linked from the bottom of this page (+ a link to answers on both those pages) (see single - entity chapter)

* This is a well laid out chapter - you are right it just needs more clarification and explanation

thanks

The proposed plan is fine and the comments appropriate.

I would prefer to see the sample tree structure display an XML file rather than some HTML code.

It looks good.  I don't remember what I meant by 
* allow the summary section to also be a reference section
but the summary sounds fine

I also think that it is wrong to call a command &quot;/join&quot; as the command itself is just &quot;JOIN&quot; and the slash indicates sending it directly to a server. Therefore, the commands should probably be listed without the slash and a small section above the command list should explain how to use them in most common clients (by putting / or sometimes /quote in front of it).

|Gold has no way to make progress with the h6 rabbit
}}The most straightforward strategy in Arimaa is to advance a rabbit and some strong pieces, attempting to rip a hole in the opponent's defenses through which the rabbit can score a goal.  If both players try to do this, the game turns into a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Race_Positions | race]].  Each player in a race must judge how many steps to spend delaying the opposing rabbit, and how many steps to use furthering their own rabbit.

Before long, however, the Arimaa community discovered that if one player tries to force goal in the opening while the other player defends, advantage accrues to the defender.  The board is too crowded for rabbits to make headway until some defenders have been captured, but the defender can easily protect his troops from capture while they are all still at home.  Meanwhile the attacking rabbit ''is'' vulnerable to capture in the defender's home traps.  In the diagram at right, the h6-rabbit is no threat to reach the goal, but the rabbit itself is in danger of capture in f6.  Furthermore, rabbits can't retreat, so the h6-rabbit can't save itself.  Finally, if the gold elephant advances to g6 to protect the h6-rabbit, the elephant will be [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade | blockaded]].

=== Capturing Is Impossible Too? ===

In light of the futility of forcing an early goal, top Arimaa players next turned to capturing pieces as the most plausible strategy.  Each player can easily defend his home traps, so the main offensive strategy was to drag an opposing piece to one's own home traps for capture.  (An elephant can safely go hunting for a piece to pull home, because elephants aren't vulnerable to capture.)  Unfortunately, this strategy also initially appears futile, because the opposing elephant can camp out by the trap in which the dragged piece has been threatened, and permanently make that trap safe.

|Silver has defended against an elephant with an elephant, and against a camel with a camel
}}
Since a defensive elephant can make any one trap safe forever, attackers resort to ''overloading'' the defending elephant by simultaneously threatening to capture two different pieces in two different traps.  Yet even this may lead to one more round of frustration.  If you make a capture threat with your elephant, the opposing elephant will block it, and if you make a second capture threat with your camel, the opposing camel will block it.  In the diagram at left, Gold is apparently stymied despite having generated a capture threat in each home trap.

Indeed, one might wonder why pieces of equal strength don't stalemate each other on down the line, resulting in a quagmire where neither side can ever make progress.  Some Arimaa players feared that the game was by nature too defensive for attacking play to ever pay off.

The strategic answer to this conundrum, namely taking a ''camel hostage'', was the first deep strategy ever discovered in Arimaa.  It gave humans their first advantage over computer programs in what had been, before then, a nearly equal contest.  Indeed, to this day the fact that neither player can afford to give up a camel hostage informs every opening strategy.  It makes the [[Arimaa/Lone_Elephant_Attacks | lone elephant attack]] ultimately effective, and discourages counter-attack when one launches an [[Arimaa/Elephant_and_Horse_Attacks | elephant-horse attack]].

Throughout the opening and midgame, a player who can't punish an opposing camel advance will likely be unable to make any progress whatsoever, because most trouble apart from a camel hostage can be relieved by the opposing elephant and/or camel.  Applying secondary strategies first, even successfully, will only lead to frustration when the opposing heavy pieces sail to the rescue.  Gaining a camel hostage, in contrast to subtler plans, not only gives one an advantage, it also makes the resulting position simpler and easier to play.  Therefore the camel hostage should be every beginner's first study after the basic tactics.

|The gold elephant is holding the silver camel hostage.
}}

In the position at right, the gold elephant is holding the silver camel hostage.  The camel is frozen, so it can't escape, and on any turn Gold could flip or pull it into the c3 trap.  To preserve the camel, Silver must station his elephant next to the c3 trap.  Silver can't defend with less than the elephant, because any other silver defender could itself be captured in c3, unless there were ''two'' silver defenders securely in place, which would be hard to maintain if the silver elephant were elsewhere.

Herein lies the answer to the defensive conundrum of equal forces stalemating each other.  Gold's elephant is tying up Silver's elephant and camel both, leaving Gold's camel unopposed as the strongest free piece.  As long as the camel hostage remains in place, Gold can dominate the other side of the board. The silver camel obviously can't defend f3, and at present the silver elephant can't defend f3 without losing the silver camel.

===Horses Advance===

Gold might be inclined to immediately advance the free camel, but advancing horses is much safer.  Imagine in this diagram that instead of the horse, the gold camel were on a6.  Silver to move could send his elephant to b6, setting the stage for an even camel trade, which would be a disappointing outcome for Gold. Since the camel captures would each use all four steps of a turn, neither elephant could come back and save its own camel. 

The gold horse on the west wing is actually not attacking so much as it is defending the c6 trap.  The hostage camel keeps Silver's elephant next to the c3 trap, but it can still dart around as long as it is on c4, d3, or even c2 at the end of a turn.  This mobility could allow the silver elephant to dislodge a small gold piece and gradually move it up.  If the silver elephant could get a weak gold piece into silver territory, and Gold had nothing there to protect it, that gold piece would soon be lost while the silver camel would remain safe.  The gold horses are prepared to defend the c6 and f6 traps, short-circuiting any such shenanigans by Silver. The gold horse in the west must keep some distance from the silver elephant, to avoid being frozen on c5 and then captured in two steps.

As long as the camel hostage is intact, Gold's best bet is to use his horse on the east wing to drag down one little piece at a time for capture in f3. This seemingly tedious strategy can ultimately decimate Silver's forces, if the silver camel and elephant both remain away from the action. Silver rabbits in the northeast are especially vulnerable, since Silver cannot hope to shield them all, and a rabbit cannot retreat backward. With the silver camel stuck in the west and the silver elephant committed to defending it, any available silver piece which tries to protect the f3 trap will itself be captured by the gold camel. On g3, the gold camel can deter silver horses from advancing, or capture them if they are reckless enough. The gold horses are the pieces which should operate away from home territory for the time being. Even if a smaller gold piece were to get pulled up, the gold horses could defend the c6 and f6 traps, and still deliver smaller silver pieces to the f3 trap. Depending on what Silver does, Gold may later want to advance his camel, but should keep f3 protected, and avoid offering Silver a camel trade.

Realizing that Gold is poised to take control, what should Silver do? Silver needs to free his elephant. It would be hard to save the camel, but in this case Silver can contain the damage. If Silver moves his elephant to b6, and the silver camel is then captured, Silver can pull the gold horse from a6 into c6, capturing it in return. Alternatively, if Silver still wanted to try to preserve his camel, he could unfreeze it with his horse and push the gold dog away, burrowing the camel so that it could not be captured in one turn&amp;mdash;this is an option only because Gold has neglected to put a piece on b2, which would have fenced in any a3 hostage. Even as things are, however, burrowing the camel would only be a delaying tactic by Silver, since the camel would hardly be free, and could still be captured if the silver elephant left.

Whether or not one can get immediate compensation for a camel loss, it is crucial that one's elephant be freed from a hostage which gives the enemy the strongest free piece.  The best answer to a camel hostage is to rotate out one's elephant.  Two other pieces can defend the trap if they have support behind them.  In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=16609&amp;s=w this game], diagrammed at right, Gold is strategically lost because the arrival of the silver dogs has freed the silver elephant to roam, whereas the gold elephant must stay put to prevent an immediate goal.  Suddenly the tables have turned and Silver's elephant is the strongest free piece.

This is the last and most subtle reason for the gold camel to stay home on defense when Gold has the silver camel hostage.  Imagine that the gold camel were at home in the diagram at right, lurking on d2 for example. Once the silver elephant left the f3 trap, the gold camel could confront the new silver defenders. Silver would then have to scramble to prevent multiple captures.  
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|Gold must now attack Silver's home traps 
}}
The most active defense against a camel hostage is to bring up pieces either numerous enough or strong enough to contest both enemy traps.  In [http://arimaa.com/arimaa/gameroom/replayFlash.cgi?gid=19732&amp;s=w this game], diagrammed at left, Gold can't make a capture in either c3 or f3, despite holding the silver camel hostage.  The gold camel would like to help regain control of c3, but the silver elephant is well-positioned in the way.

Who has the strongest free piece now?  The silver elephant is more free than the gold elephant, but it isn't totally free, because if it crosses back to the silver side of the board, the gold camel will smash across into the silver horses around c3.  Likewise, the gold camel isn't really a free piece, because it needs to lurk around in order to keep the silver elephant committed to defending c3.

As it turns out, the gold horses are suddenly the strongest free pieces. Gold can't yet force a capture at home, but he can use both horses to take over an enemy trap (most likely f6), threatening captures and ultimately goals. Silver might then move his elephant to the defense of that trap, and further threaten one or both of the gold horses with capture, but in that case Gold will stand to gain even more than that in c3 and f3. Gold's upper hand traces back to the camel hostage.  

These few positions are only scratching the surface of possible play when a camel is held hostage, but they should give an inkling both of how a camel hostage gives one an advantage, and of how it is the foundation of much deeper strategies.

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide 3.3 Creating A Hand (an intrinsically organic shape) Now that you have the basics down you can try to model something more challenging than a dog house. Wings3D uses a modeling technique know as subdivision surfaces, a technique favored by many to create organic, or natural world, type of models. So it seems fitting that for our second model we attempt to create an organic type model; in this case we will attempt a hand. So do a File | New to get a fresh slate and put a cube in your work area. Since hands are not cubes, let us begin by scaling the cube into a flatter shape, more conducive to hand building. Switch to Body selection mode by clicking on the Body icon on the icon bar or by hitting the B key. Then click on the cube to select it.


Figure 18: Cube preparation. A selected object becomes highlighted in the current Selection Color as set in the user's Color Preferences. Here the cube is selected.

DRAFT 1.6 27

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Now that the cube is selected we can change its basic shape via some of the Body functions found in the Body Operations menu. With the cube still selected right click out in the open workspace somewhere to call up the Object enu. A menu will pop up with all the available functions for full body manipulation.


Figure 19: A refresher. With the cube selected, right click in the Workspace to bring up the Object Menu. Only operations relevant to object manipulation are available.

28 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide Hover over Scale and a sidebar menu will come up with things you can do regarding the Scale function.


Figure 20: Working with the context sensitive menus. Menu items with side arrows have associated Side Bar Menus. Selecting the menu item, in this case Scale, will bring up the Side Bar Menu. Here we select Scale – Z so that we can make the cube thinner.

DRAFT 1.6 29

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Click on Z to limit changes in scale to the Z axis and then drag your mouse to the left (the -Z direction) to make the cube narrower.


Figure 21: A palm is born. The cube has been adjusted to form the palm of our hand model.

Left click to end the Scale operation.

30 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide 3.4 Adding Detail Now we will add some fingers and a thumb to the basic hand block. Begin by clicking on the Edge Mode Icon at the bottom of the workspace to switch to Edge Selection Mode. Notice that all the edges become highlighted, because they were derived from a previously selected object. Hit the Space Bar to deselect everything. Now select the top two edges, as illustrated below. Right click in the workspace to bring up the Edge Operations menu and choose Cut and then 4 from the side bar menu to cut the top edges into four equal parts. Notice that upon completing the Cut operation you are automatically switched to Vertex Mode with the affected vertices pre-selected as seen on the top right frame of the picture below. Right click in the workspace to bring up the Vertex Operations menu and select the Connect function. New edges will snap into place, as seen in the bottom right frame below, thus forming four new faces on the top side of the hand block. These will eventually become the base faces for our fingers.


Figure 22: Cut in the finger nubs. Select the top two edges (top left). Right click for the Edge Menu (top middle) and Cut by 4. This creates new vertices (top right) which are pre-selected. Another right click brings up the Vertex Menu (bottom left) where we can Connect the vertices to create four new faces (bottom right).

DRAFT 1.6 31

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Now select the two side edges of the hand block. Right click in the workspace to bring up the Edge Menu and select Connect. A new edge will be created that connects the two sides, thus breaking the side face into two equal faces while leaving the new edge in the selected state. While it is still selected right click for the Edge Menu again and Move in the Y direction just a bit. Hit the space bar to deselect everything and then select the two lower vertical edges on the side and Connect them. Slide the resultant edged down with the Move Y function so that it is just above the base of the hand. We now have faces in place that can form the base of the four fingers and the thumb.


Figure 23: Cut in the thumb nub. Select the two side edges (top left) and Connect them. Move the resultant edge (top middle) down in Y via the Edge Menu Move Y function (top right). Then select the two lower edges (bottom left) and connect them. Then using the Edge Menu Move Y function again (bottom middle), move the new edge down along Y to form the base face that will become the thumb.

32 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide Next we will use the Face function Extrude to create some basic fingers. Switch to Face Selection Mode by clicking on the Face Icon at the bottom of the Workspace. Then click on the four faces that will form the base of the four fingers. Right click for the Face Operations menu and select Extrude and then select Y. Move your mouse to the right to extrude the faces up a bit then left click to end the extrusion. Notice that the end faces remain selected, facilitating another extrude. So do another, shorter, extrusion. This will later form knuckles. Then carry on with the extrusions as illustrated in Figure 24. You do not have to constantly right click to bring up the context sensitive menu, however. Wings has a Repeat command, accessed by simply hitting the D key on your keyboard. It can save you quite a bit of time if you are doing many of the same types of functions over and over, as here with the finger extrusions.


Figure 24: Extrude the fingers. Select the finger base faces (top right) and Extrude in Y a little (top center). Do a shorter Extrude for some knuckles (top left). Then carry on as shown in the lower frames.

DRAFT 1.6 33

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL To add a thumb we will do another set of extrusions, but we don't want the thumb to stick straight out from the side of the palm, so we will also use the Rotate function. Select the face we created earlier for the base of the thumb and do a Extrude in X. By now you should have gotten the knack of the context sensitive menus, so I will stop telling you to right click in the Workspace to bring up the Face Operations menu... to help speed things along. The extruded face will still be selected, so now do a Rotate in Z. Move your mouse back and forth to see how the face will rotate about the Z axis, rotating up when moved to the right, and rotating down when moved to the left. Rotate the face up until it looks about like the illustration in Figure 16. Left click to stop rotating. Now do a series of extrusions. This time we will Extrude Normal rather than along one of the primary axis. Extruding in the normal simply means to move the extrusion along a vector perpendicular to its plane. Then it is simply a matter of doing two more extrusions and we have a very crude model of a hand.


Figure 25: Extrude the thumb. Extrude the base thumb face (top left). Then Rotate the end face about the Z axis (top right). Extrude in along the Normal three more times (lower left) to complete our rough-in of a hand (lower right).

34 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide 3.5 Finishing It Off This hand, admittedly, looks very crude. There is a little we can do to make it look better while introducing you to some more Wings3D tools and concepts. So let's take the hand model just a little bit further before calling it quits.

We want to add some additional detail to make the hand look more natural. But first, let's see what it looks like as is, in the smooth shaded mode and again with one Smooth applied to it. I will frequently do a Smooth operation while modeling just to get a feel for how things are going, then Undo to continue modeling. You may find that technique useful too. And a Smooth will help you isolate and fix problems in your model caused by bad geometry that some times lurks in unexpected places.


Figure 26: The Smooth operation. The hand in Flat Shaded Mode (top left) and in Smooth Shaded Mode (top middle). With the hand selected do one Smooth operation (top right). You can see the results of the Smooth in Flat Shaded Mode on the bottom image set here; the left one while the hand is still selected. On the far right is a smooth shaded view of the hand following the Smooth operation. While it looks much more &quot;organic&quot; it still appears to be far from natural.

Hit the Space Bar to make sure nothing is selected. Now left click on the Smooth Shaded Icon (the rightmost icon on the left set of icons) on the Icon Bar to see what our un-smoothed hand looks like. Yikes! Hit the Tab key to leave Smooth Shaded Mode. Note that you can enter and leave Smooth Shaded either way, via the icons or via the Tab key. Now select the hand again and do a Smooth. Hit the Space Bar to deselect the hand and then hit the Tab key to see the smoothed hand in smooth shaded mode. Not very impressive.

DRAFT 1.6 35

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Now undo the smooth by selecting the Undo function from the Edit Menu. Do this as often as needed to get back to the un-smoothed version of the hand. We will now attempt to make it look at least a little more natural by adding some finger nails, some knuckle bumps, and some tendons. To save space and since you should have a pretty good feel for the basic operations by now, I will not take you though the process of adding these details step by step. Rather, I will present you with a set of sample objects in Figure 27 and tell you in general what I did to get the details you see there. I've made the screen shots here a little bigger so that you can see more of the detail. So take a moment to study the edges as they progress in the picture below.

Quick Tip: Overlaying the wireframe on a smooth shaded view.

Some people find it very useful to overlay the wireframe on a smooth shaded view of their model. This serves two purposes; first it helps them find surface anomalies while at the same time being able to see what edges may be the culprits, and second it gives new modelers a sense of how edges and edge loops affect the overall form of the model. To get the wireframe on the smooth shaded view simply hit the Tab key to get the smooth shaded preview of the model then hit the W key to overlay the wireframe. Note that you can change the color of the wireframe in the Edit | Preferences menu.

36 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 3: A Quick Start Guide Figure 27: Adding details. Detail has been added (top) by selecting edges or vertices as needed and Connecting them to rough in the knuckles and tendons. Then more detail was added (bottom) adding more edges via Connects and then Moving vertices to form knuckle bulges and round out the palm. Finger nails were created by selecting faces and Extruding Region.

In the top portion of Figure 27 above I added more details by doing a series of Connects. One set of Connects was done to create a loop that separates the hand front to back. Then four loops were created the same way to completely encircle the hand down the length and each finger and into and around the palm. Then another another set of edges was created to run from the index finger tendon up the side of the thumb, and back down the other side. Then to create more of a knuckle shape, the vertices at the front and back of each knuckle were Scaled in Y to spread them apart thus creating the diamond shaped areas.

In the bottom section of Figure 27 I added yet more detail. To add detail to to knuckles I Dissolved the edges on the inside of the diamonds (front and back) and then Inset them a bit to create inner diamonds. Then I used Connect on vertices to create the details you see here.

DRAFT 1.6 37

� Section 3: A Quick Start Guide WINGS3D USER MANUAL Then I Moved the inner vertices out to form bumps on the backside of the fingers and in to form creases on the inside of the fingers. Then I selected the faces for the finger nails (four per nail by the way, not just two) and did an Extrude Region slightly into the fingers. Then I scaled down the region just a bit and then did another Extrude Region to raise the nails just past the level of the skin. Of course I did all this stuff for the thumb too.

Now my attention turned to the hand itself. I added four more edge loops that surrounded the hand. Then I added edges to form the V shape around each of the tendons. This allowed me to Move the edges for the tendons out so that they bump up a little. Of course on the palm of the hand I Moved them into the hand a bit to form creases. Then I went about the outside of the hand and in between the knuckles and tried to round things up a bit by moving vertices. It's not looking too bad at this point, in fact, the hand is almost complete.

Figure 28 below shows some final detail I have cut into the palm of the hand, the life lines, as used in palm readings. They were created by doing some Connects on the edges to include the curve of the lines. Then the lines were Beveled to turn them into double lines and then the vertices were Moved into the hand to create the necessary creases. This completed the modeling portion of the hand. Be we are not done. In the bottom half of Figure 28 you can see that I have assigned colors to the hand. It is important for you to assign colors to your models before you consider your task complete because each different color assignment can be used to great effect in subsequent paint and rendering programs.

In the bottom half of Figure 28 you can see that I have made two distinct color assignments; one for the skin of the hand, and one for the nails. later when I create a texture map, I will be able to pull the model apart and arrange the parts nicely in my texture mapping program of choice because I did this. In fact, if I were smart, I would have assigned a different texture to the front and back of the hands so that they could be easily isolated for painting. So, to make these color assignments simply select the faces to be assigned a color and then use the Face | Set Material operation. You will be presented with a pop-up box with New, Default and Hole as choices. Select New and you will be prompted for a material name. Give the faces a short but logical name. Skin and nails come to mind for me here. The Material Editor will come up, as shown in Figure 29 below.

Click on the little boxes to bring up sub-menus (Figure 29a) for setting the actual values for the

the slider bars.

You can set the diffuse, ambient, specular,

and emissive colors as well as the

shininess and opacity of the selected faces.

The effects of your changes will show up

interactively in the color box to the left.

Figure 29a: An example of the Material Editor When you click OK the effects will be sub-menus. reflected on the ball on the left side of the

material editor window. Once you are happy

with your settings click the OK button on the material editor window. You don't really need to get too fancy here, especially at first, so just make a color you like for skin and click OK.

The fastest way to do this is to set up the largest material first by selecting the object then switching to Face Mode so that all faces are selected. Then assign all the faces that color, in this case, skin. After hitting OK in the Material Editor you can then select the nails and do another Set Material, and then dream up you nail color. Say OK again. Then hit the Space Bar to deselect everything so you see your creation in full color. Don't forget to Save your model before quitting, and you may also want to Export it into a format that your rendering program can read.

That should give you the basics for organic modeling in Wings since a hand is definitely an organic subject. Not to say my model is a particularly good example of if. It is not a lifelike hand at all. But considering it is the first Human hand I ever modeled, it did not turn out too badly. And since subdivision surface modeling is known to be particularly good for organic type models this was a good exercise. Now you can try something else organic. I recommend you do what I did for the hand. I found some cages (finished hands in wireframe mode prior to smoothing) and analyzed them to see where the artists had placed the edges and then tried to emulate their examples. My thanks to Mike Rickard for providing the hand model that inspired this one. His was much better, but I needed to do this from scratch so that I could adequately describe what the steps were. But there are plenty of cages posted out on the web, simple screen shots of non-smoothed models. Use them as your guide until you develop a style of your own.

**A Brief Introduction to Pixel Art
***&quot;A great thing to do in school or at the office!&quot;
***&quot;Keep in mind, pixel'rs, the scale of the pixel art is up to you, but keep things CONSISTENT!&quot;
***What you'll need
****MS Paint or a similar paint program with basic zoom functions
****Photoshop is obligatory, but can be a great help when doing anti-aliasing, shading, and transparency.
****An imagination and eye for what's right
*The Basics

**Making a box
***Geometry
***Shading
**Some other basic shapes
***Cones, rectangles, spheres
**Combining these shapes to make something
***Buildings
***Statues
***Vehicles
**Doo-dads
***Often, the scale of pixel art does not lend itself to allow smaller objects- such as people- to be drawn according to the traditional pixel art persepective (I.E., for every 2 pixels across, 1 down).  Because of this, it is up to the artist to choose by which method to draw smaller doodads.  Here are some examples on how you may wish to do it:
***People, Animals, and other tiny things
*Pixel Art Gallery
**Inspiration
***Games (Sim City, Habbo Hotel, Coke Music, Ultima Online, etc..)
***Art Gallery
*Links

I have the feeling this book is going to be more of a picture gallery than anything else! :)
All pictures for galleries in this book should be 100x100 or 200x200 so looks nice and is not distorted by thumbnailing.

� Section 2: The Wings3D User Interface WINGS3D USER MANUAL 2.8 The Information String If you have an element of geometry selected Wings will display some basic information on that element (or elements) in a string at the top left-hand side of the workspace. 

2.9 Wings Units A Wings Unit (wu) is arbitrary in size and can be thought of in terms of any real world units desired. The Wings grid is composed of squares each 1x1 wu in size. The standard Wings cube is cube is 2 x 2 x 2 Wings Units in size. If building a model from scratch you can arbitarily decide that a wu will represent inches, feet, meters or miles; whichever is most appropriate for the task at hand.

Quick Tip: Working With Wings Units

When working with many Wings commands dragging with the Shift key depressed will cause movement to be constrained to whole units, while the Ctrl key will cause movement to be constrained to tenths of units. Holding down Shift + Ctrl keys constrains operations to hundredths of a wings unit. While it seems the same as the readout – as this is only 2 decimal places – it is possible to do unconstrained drags and get elements that are 3 decimal places when measured, even though the read out only shows two. Had me tearing my hair out on more than one occasion. Where it matters I use Shift + Ctrl.

The color of this text is set in the Edit | Preferences menu via the Text Color parameter. If you find this text string annoying you can hide it by simply changing the text color to match the background color of the workspace. I do not recommend this course of action since you can glean some useful information here. If you select an element, a vertex for example, Wings will inform you of the Vertex ID and it's position in X, Y, and Z. Furthermore, if you select another vertex, so that two are selected at the same time, it will tell you how far apart they are. If you select a single edge it will tell you how long that edge is. This can be very useful, especially in modeling buildings and the like.

It is not uncommon for Wings units and other 3D packages units to be vastly different in size. Therefore you will need to experiment with the import/export sizing options to get suitably sized objects on import/export. Scaling by 1000, for example, brings in a Poser model at a decent working scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Dialog Boxes==
'''Dialog Boxes''' are used to enter values via the keyboard as parameters for operations in Wings.  Some Dialog Boxes popup when the user chooses to enter a value numerically and other popup automatically asking the user to enter a value before proceeding.
===Tab Entry Dialog Box===
The most common is the '''Tab Entry Dialog Box'''.  Perhaps that's not its official name, but it serves as a valid description.  Pressing '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' during most types of operations that involve ''Scaling'', ''Moving'', ''Rotating'', or ''Extruding'' elements of geometry invokes this dialog box.  The Information Line will tell you when this option is available.  When the user presses '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' during such an operation, the '''Tab Entry Dialog Box''' will open with the present value of the operation already entered, ready for the user to edit.
[[Image:Wings_Tab_Entry.png|frame|left|''This screen shot depicts a'' '''Move/Free''' ''operation in progress with the selected face.  Pressing'' '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' ''during such an operation will bring up the'' '''Numeric Input''' ''dialog box.  In this case, the user is asked to enter numeric values for x, y, z.  In other cases, such dialogs may ask the user to specify'' '''Degrees''' ''for rotation, or a'' '''Percentage''' '' for a scale operation.  Entries for these types of'' '''Tab Entry Dialog Boxes''' ''may be either positive or negative, or even include math.  To navigate the dialog box, the user must press'' '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' ''to move from entry to entry, or to'' '''Ok''' ''or'' '''Cancel''' ''the operation.  Mouse functions are disabled during these types of operations.  The active input is highlighted in light blue and bold edged in black.'']]

===Why Use The Tab Entry Dialog Box===
Most often, the '''Tab Entry Dialog Box''' is used to input a specific value for an operation, that is not possible to enter using ''Constraints'' or easily achieved by simple ''Dragging''.

----
:*Using ''Constraints'' for measures while moving or extruding elements allows for 0.010, 0.10, 1.0 increments in Wings Units (wu).
:*Using ''Constraints'' for angles during rotations will do so at  1/15°, 1°, 15° increments.
:*Using ''Constraints'' during scaling types of operation will limit scaling to 1%, 10% and 100% increments.
:*Using simple ''Dragging'' is only good for eyeballing measurements and should not be used for anything that requires precision.
----

Use the ''Tab Entry Dialog Box'' if the value you require is not offered by ''Constraints'' or the operation is too precise to use ''Dragging''.  












====''Math In Dialog Boxes''====
*There are some interesting feature to this dialog box that are not apparent at first glance.  Wings understands most of the common mathematical expressions including addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/).  It is perfectly feasible to type ''12.345+0.1/1.67-4'' into the dialog, press '''&lt;Enter&gt;''' and receive a result for a particular operation.  But honestly, there should be some ''sense'' to the numbers you type so here's a useful example using the Wings cube primitive.

::'''''Situation:'''''  You have an Edge that is 2 wu, and you want it to be 4.563 wu.  Length you have = 2 wu       Length you want = 4.563 wu

::'''''Procedure:'''''  '''1)''' Make a cube.
:::::'''2)''' Select one of its edges.
:::::'''3)''' Open the Right-Click-Context-Menu and select Scale Uniform.
:::::'''4)''' Press &lt;Tab&gt; to open the Dialog Box.
:::::'''5)'''  Enter the following formula substituting in the proper values.
::::::''The length you want multiplied by one hundred and divided by the length you have.''
::::::Or in this case, input '''4.563*100/2''' and press '''&lt;Enter&gt;'''.

::'''''Result:'''''  The length of the selected edge should now be 4.563 wu as displayed in the Status Bar.

::'''''Conclusion:'''''  The reality of the above procedure is that you'll need a pencil and paper for anything complicated.  In the previous example ''the length you have'' was 2, but often this number will be several digits long with a decimal thrown in and on top of that there is ''the length you want''!  So just bear that in mind as Wings still lacks a cut and paste feature.  Also, the described procedure uses Scale Uniform which results in both ends of the edge moving uniformly from the centre point of the edge.  To scale the edge from one point and so keep one end of the edge stationary, you would have to have '''Advanced Menus''' on and select '''Scale Uniform''' the  Right Mouse Button option (&quot;Choose point to scale from&quot;), then &quot;Pick point to scale from&quot; (this will be the one that will remain stationary), and press '''&lt;Tab&gt;''' to input the formula.


----
''Note that Wings also recognizes the following list of mathematical expressions as long as you type '''math:''' before the expression.  ie. '''math:pi''' would be pi.  Here are the allowed expressions: '''sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh, exp, log, log10, pow, sqrt, abs, pi '''''
----


====''Dialog Box History''====

*Another feature of the dialog boxes is a kind of ''history'' feature.  Say you performed the above example and wanted to try it again on another edge of the cube.  Maybe this time trying the alternate example in the ''conclusion'' with '''Advanced Menus''' on.  The formula remains the same for both examples, so when you get to the ''Tab Entry Dialog Box'' try pressing the ''up'' arrow key.  Pressing the up and down arrow key will scroll through the history of past inputs.  In this case, when you push the up arrow key, 4.563*100/2 should popup in the dialog box and you can press enter to complete the procedure.

[[Image:Input_Example.png|frame|left|''Pressing the '''up''' or '''down''' arrow keys will scroll the '''history''' of previous entries in the Dialog Box.'']]

*Access to previous entries in a dialog box can be a useful.  Especially when you have to perform the same procedure more than once in a session.  Here's a good example of where this feature can be helpful.  Consider the '''Tighten''' command in the ''Right-Click Vertex Menu''.  Often times organic modelers will want to use '''Tighten''' to smooth out an extrusion or average out a model's vertices to make a cleaner looking mesh.  Some modelers do this quite often as part of their work flow using a technique called ''Selection Jumping''.  The '''Tighten''' command uses averaging and is tabulated as a percentage.  Applying '''Tighten''' at the same percentage every time you use the tool, will make you more able to predict its results.  This is a good reason to use the history function in the dialog box.  It allows you to quickly repeat a procedure at a constant value.  This way you can press '''Tighten''', '''&lt;Tab&gt;''', '''Up Arrow'''. '''&lt;Enter&gt;''', if you are going to use the same value as the last time.

----
''Note that Dialog Box input history is not exclusive to each tool.  It keeps a running history of the inputs for all tools.  This means it is the last entry you typed, that will appear when you press '''Up Arrow''' once, not necessarily the input you typed for the last time you used that particular tool.''

==Introduction to array operations ==

As arrays are the basic data structure in MATLAB, it is important to understand how to use them effectively. See the previous section for that.

Arrays in MATLAB obey the same rule as their mathematical counterpart: by default, the ''matrix definitions'' of operations are used, unless a special operator called the dot operator is applied.

Because arrays operations are so similar to the equivalent mathematical operations, a basic knowledge of linear algebra is mandatory to use matlab effectively. However, we won't be as precise as in mathematics when using the terms vector and matrix. In MATLAB, both are arrays of doubles (thus being a matrix in the real mathematical meaning), and MATLAB considers vectors as a matrices with only one row or only one column. However, there are special functions just for vectors; see the vector module for an explanation of how to use these.

== Basics ==

=== Accessing elements of a matrix ===
==== Using a Single Index ====
Now that you know how to define a simple array, you should know how to access its elements. Accessing the content of an array is done through the operator (), with the index inside the parenthesis; the indexing of the first element is 1:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3];
 &gt;&gt; a(1)
  
 ans =
 
     1

 &gt;&gt; a(3)
 
 ans =
 
     3
 
Accessing an element outside the bounds will result in an error:

 &gt;&gt; a(5)
 ???  Index exceeds matrix dimensions.

====Using Multiple Indexes==== 

To access a single matrix element, you can use the (i,j) subscript, where i is the index in the row, and j in the column:

 &gt;&gt; a= [1, 2; 3, 4];
 &gt;&gt; a(1, 2)
 
 ans = 
 
     2
 
 &gt;&gt; a(2, 1)
  
 ans = 
 
     3

====Using A Unique Index====  
You can also access a matrix element through a unique index; in this case, the order is column major, meaning you first go through
all elements of the first column, then the 2d column, etc... The column major mode is the same as in Fortran, and the contrary
of the order in the C language.

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; a(3)
 
 ans =
 
     2

====Using a Colon (:) for a Block Index====  
It is also possible to access blocks of matrices using the colon (:) operator. This operator is like a wildcard; it tells MATLAB that you want all elements of a given dimension or with indices between two given values. For example, say you want to access the entire first row of matrix a above, but not the second row. Then you can write:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; a(1,:) %row 1, every column
 ans = 
    1     2     3

Now say you only want the first two elements in the first row. To do this, use the following syntax:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];
 &gt;&gt; a(1, 1:2)
 ans = 
    1     2

The syntax a(:) changes a into a column vector (column major):

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
 &gt;&gt; a(:)
 ans = 
    1
    4
    2
    5
    3
    6

====Using the '''end''' Operator====  

Finally, if you do not know the size of an array but wish to access all elements from a certain index until the end of the array, use the end operator, as in

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
 &gt;&gt; a(1, 2:end) %row 1, columns from 2 until end of the array
 ans =
    2     3

=== Logical Addressing ===

In addition to index addressing, you can also access only elements of an array that satisfy some logical criterion. For example, suppose a = [1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.5] and you only want the values between 2 and 4. Then you can achieve this in two ways. The first is to use the ''find'' function to find the indices of all numbers between 2 and 4 in the array, and then address the array with those indices:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.5];
 &gt;&gt; INDICES = find(a &gt;= 2 &amp; a &lt;= 4);
 &gt;&gt; a(INDICES)
 ans =
    2.1   3.2

This does not work in MATLAB 2006b.

The second method is to use logical addressing, which first changes a into a logical array, with value 1 if the logical expression is true and 0 if it is false. It then finds and returns all values in the a which are true. The syntax for this is as follows:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.5];
 &gt;&gt; a(a &gt;= 2 &amp; a &lt;= 4)
 ans =
    2.1   3.2

== Basic operations ==

=== Rational Operators on Arrays ===
==== Addition and Subtraction ====
The interesting part is of course applying some operations on those arrays. You can for example use the classic arithmetic operations + and -
on any array in matlab: this results in the vector addition and subtraction as defined in classic vector vectors spaces  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, which
is simply the addition and subtraction elements wise:

 &gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] - [1, 2, 1]
 
 ans = 
  
    0   0   2

====Multiplication by a Scalar====

The multiplication by a scalar also works as expected:

 &gt;&gt; 2 * [1, 2, 3] 
 
 ans = 
 
    [2, 4, 6]
====Multiplying and Dividing Arrays====

Multiplication and division are more problematic: multiplying two vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; does not make sense. It makes sense only
in the matrix context. Using the symbol * in matlab computes the ''matrix product'', which is only defined when the number of columns of the left operand matches the number of rows of the right operand:

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2; 3, 4];
 &gt;&gt; a * a
 
 ans =

     7    10
    15    22

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]; b = [1; 2; 3];
 &gt;&gt; a * a
 ??? Error using ==&gt; *
 Inner matrix dimensions must agree.
 &gt;&gt; a * b
 
 ans =
 
    14


Using the division symbol / has even more constraints, as it imposes the right operand to be invertible (see [[Wikipedia:Invertible matrix]]). For square matrices, &lt;math&gt;a / b&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;a * b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For example :

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2; 3, 4]; b = [1, 2; 1, 2]
 &gt;&gt; b / a
 
 ans =
 
     1     0
     1     0

 &gt;&gt; a / b
 Warning: Matrix is singular to working precision.
 
 ans =
 
   Inf   Inf
   Inf   Inf

====Component-wise Operations ====
If you desire to multiply or divide two matrices or vectors component-wise, or to raise all components of one matrix to the same power, rather than using matrix definitions of these operators, you can use the dot (.) operator. The two matrices must have the same dimensions. For example, for multiplication,

 &gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3];
 &gt;&gt; b = [0, 1, 2];
 &gt;&gt; a .* b
 
 ans =
 
   0    2    6

The other two componentwise operators are ./ and .^.

As matlab is a numerical computing language, you should keep in mind that a matrix which is theoretically invertible may lead to precision problems and thus giving imprecise results or even totally wrong results. The message above &quot;matrix is singular to working precision&quot; should appear in those cases, meaning the results cannot be trusted.

Non-square matrices can also be used as the right operand of /; in this case, it computes the [[w:Pseudoinverse|pseudoinverse]]. This is especially useful in least square problems.

====Transpose====

A transpose of a matrix is taken using '''.''''

  &gt;&gt; array = [1,2;3,4]
  array =
     1     2
     3     4
  &gt;&gt; array.'
  ans =
     1     3
     2     4

=== Boolean Operators on Arrays ===

The same boolean operators that can be used for point values can also be used to compare arrays. To do this, MATLAB compares the elements componentwise and returns them in a logical array of the same size as the two arrays being compared. The two arrays must have the same size. For example,

 &lt;pre&gt;
 &gt;&gt; A = [2,4], B = [1,5];
 &gt;&gt; A &lt; B
 
 ans =
    [0    1]
 &lt;/pre&gt;

You must be careful when using comparisons between arrays as loop conditions, since they clearly do not return single values and therefore can cause ambiguous results. The loop condition should be reducable to a single boolean value, T or F, not an array. Two common ways of doing this are the &quot;any&quot; and the &quot;all&quot; functions. A function call any(''array'') will return true if ''array'' contains any nonzero values and false if all values are zero. It does the comparisons in one direction first then the other, so to reduce a matrix you must call the any function ''twice''. The function ''all'', similarly, returns true if and only if all elements in a given row or column are nonzero.

=== Concatenating Arrays ===

Concatenating arrays involves sticking arrays together.

===== Horizontal Concatenating =====

Horizontal concatenation is done by treating an array as if it were a variable included in a row. 

  &gt;&gt; a = [1,2;3,4];
  &gt;&gt; b = [5,6;7,8];
  &gt;&gt; c = [a,b]
  c =
     1     2     5     6
     3     4     7     8

===== Vertical Concatenating =====

Vertical concatenation is done by treating an array as if it were a variable included in a column. 
  &gt;&gt; a = [1,2;3,4];
  &gt;&gt; b = [5,6;7,8];
  &gt;&gt; c = [a;b]
  c =
     1     2
     3     4
     5     6
     7     8

==Solving Linear Systems==
To solve a linear system in the form '''A'''x = b use the &quot;\&quot; operator.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;A = [4 5 ; 2 8];
b = [23 28]';
x = A\b

x =

     2
     3&lt;/pre&gt;

In the second paragraph it says that &quot;Jehovah presented himself in the human form to Moses . . .&quot;. In the Bible at any rate it doesn’t seem to say anything about whether God/Jehovah was in '''human''' form, so maybe this should be reworded.

== God for the Third Millennium:Deus ex machina (comment ==

Are we being objective here, can you realy ignore the views of over one billion Moslims.
If you dont have accurate information about the faith, then please state the fact.

== Christian slant? ==

I don't mean to be rude, and I identify as a Christian, but it seems to me that this section is very much into the Christian viewpoint, and not so much with anything else. I'd like to take out or attribute as Christian belief some of the more blatant stuff (references to Jesus as God's Only Son, performing miracles, etc), but I'm not sure of how much to do, or how to seperate it. Maybe I'm just being silly and unwilling to completely delete someone's hard work.

: I think this text is beyond repair. It is the typical state of a [[w:Monotheism]]: To narrowminded, uninformed. If he/she informed then he/she whould know that neiter [[w:Hinduism]] nor [[w:Budism]] are considered a [[w:Monotheism]]. That makes 2 of the to 5 religions. Personaly I belive that the [[w:Monotheism]] is a dead end - the universe is just to big for one God and this book is just one more attempt to rescue what canot be rescued. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:26, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

===FA Premier League===
[[Image:FAPL_Logo(Old).jpg|right|50px]]

In 1992 the top division of clubs in England formed a breakaway league, enabling them to take a larger share of income from media rights in comparison to the rest of the football league. The Premier League (originally Premiership) currently consists of 20 clubs.

The top four teams in the Premier League currently qualify for the UEFA Champions League (at various stages during the qualifying process). The fifth place club qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, although extra clubs often qualify on the basis of league position depending on the winners of domestic cup competitions. The bottom 3 clubs are automatically relegated.

In terms of income, viewing figures and attendances the Premier League is the most successful domestic football competition in the world, and compares favorably across all sports. However many football fans within England are concerned with the vast sums of money involved, while clubs in the lower divisions struggle, with many entering administration and some going out of business. In addition the formation of the Premier League has lead to a generation of fans growing up with football as a TV only activity (as live games become more expensive to cater for corporate hospitality). This has lead to the slow death of the local football culture which developed over the last 150 years in England.

====Manchester United====

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Humanity and nature==

For those wishing to establish a point in history when checking out the impact of human activities on the environment became a thing worth doing, a good date is 1864, and the event is the publication by George Perkins Marsh of his book, 'Man and Nature, or Physical Geography Modified by Human Action'.  In his travels as an American diplomat, Marsh was well placed not only to document environmental change, but also to evaluate it.  In this respect he is remembered for the way he forcefully pointed out the difference in attitudes between the native people's and European's attitudes to the natural world. The native leaves a slight footprint on the Earth, whilst civilisation &quot;assumes an aggressive attitude, and thenceforward strives to subdue to his control and subject to his uses, all her productivity and all her motive powers&quot;.  Another way of stating this difference is that preindustrial production systems are characteristic of 'inscribed groups', who organise for the sustained exploitation of local natural resources. They are inscribed, or embedded, into local ecosystems by being linked to the productivity of a narrow range of biophysical flows which limit the number of people who can partake of the local resources.   Modern production systems are characteristic of 'constructive groups' who construct a landscape to serve their economic aspirations, populating it beyond the limits of the local natural productivity, importing goods and services from elsewhere, thereby destroying its ecosystems. Costructive groups gather around sites where there is an application of inventions for mass production. Workers migrate attracted by better wages and prospects, taking advantage of improved communications.  

'Man and Nature' was the most comprehensive statement about land management that had ever appeared.  It was culled from Marsh's own farming experiences in New England and his research into the works of European naturalists, geographers, foresters and hydrologists.  There is no better exposition of need for environmental impact assessment and its precautionary principle than the following: 

&quot;The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve and we can never know how wide a circle of disturbance we produce in the harmonies of nature when we throw the smallest pebble in the ocean of organic life&quot;

==GEMS and Surveillance==

As far as wildlife was concerned Marsh advised farmers to err on the side of caution rather than risk destroying a vital part of their production system.

Just over a century later the US National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 required the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments for the evaluation of any detrimental effects of new schemes that would affect landform and drainage.  This was followed two years later by the Global Monitoring System (GEMS), which was endorsed by the U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.  Then followed a spate of conventions and conferences that placed the topic of environmental evaluation at the top of international and national strategies of economic development.  The practical outcomes were the application of ecological principles to programmes of surveillance, monitoring and impact assessment at the levels of biosphere, ecosystem, landscape and population.  Some of the early milestones are:

:1946  International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling establishes the International Whaling Commission.
:1948  UN Charter; International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN) established.
:1955  The Wenner Gren Conference on Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth, Wenner Gren Foundation, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.

:1957  The IUPN becomes the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).
:1958  Law of the Sea. The first UN Conference on the Law of the Sea approves draft conventions.
:1958  U.K River quality survey
:1959  Antarctic Treaty; Economic and Social Council of the u N adopts resolution to publish a register of national parks and equivalent reserves of the world.
:1961  Establishment of World Wildlife Fund (World Wide Fund for Nature).
:1961  National Survey of Air Pollution set up the the UK government in 1961
:1962  Silent Spring (Carson 1962) published.

:1970  The US National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments.
:1971  Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme of UNESCO launched. Greenpeace International founded.

==Environmental impact assessment==

===Introduction===

Environmental Impact Assessment can be defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made.  The aim of an assessment is to address biodiversity at all appropriate levels and allow for enough survey time to take seasonal features into account. It should focus on processes and services which are critical be conserved and protected in this context, it is essential that it is linked to the issue of securing sustainable livelihoods for local people based on biodiversity resources.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The starting point of every environmental assesssment is that biodiversity must be conserved to ensure it survives, continuing to provide services, values and benefits for current and future generations. The aim is to identify, protect and promote sustainable use of biodiversity, so that yields/harvests can be maintained over time. This involves examining the likely impacts of development on the benefits of biodiversity arising from the provision of essential life support systems and ecosystem services such as:

*water yield; 
*water purification; 
*breakdown of wastes; 
*flood control; 
*storm and coastal protection; 
*soil formation and conservation; 
*sedimentation processes; 
*nutrient cycling; 
*carbon storage; 
*and climatic regulation. 

An assessment process also takes into account the costs of replacing these services.

Areas with &quot;important biodiversity&quot; are those that:

*Support endemic, rare, declining habitats/species/genotypes.
*Support genotypes and species whose presence is a prerequisite for the persistence of other species.
*Act as a buffer, linking habitat or ecological corridor, or play an important part in maintaining environmental quality.
*Have important seasonal uses or are critical for migration.
*Support habitats, species populations, ecosystems that are vulnerable, threatened throughout their range and slow to recover.
*Support particularly large or continuous areas of previously undisturbed habitat.
*Act as refugia for biodiversity during climate change, enabling persistence and continuation of evolutionary processes.
*Support biodiversity for which mitigation is difficult or its effectiveness unproven including habitats that take a long time to develop characteristic biodiversity.
*Are currently poor in biodiversity but have potential to develop high biodiversity with appropriate intervention.


In 2005 the International Association for Impact Assessment (http://www.iaia.org/) published a public document on the guiding principles intended to promote &quot;biodiversity-inclusive&quot; impact assessment (IA), including Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for projects, and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for policies, plans and programs.

The aim was to help practitioners to integrate biodiversity in IA, decision-makers to commission and review IAs, and other stakeholders to ensure their biodiversity interests are addressed in development planning.  This document serves as a useful introduction to the concept.

It centralises biodiversity as a cross-cutting theme relevant to all fields of IA, where the aim for conservation is to work to biodiversity-related Conventions that are based on the premise that further loss of biodiversity is unacceptable. 

Impacts of development projects are assessed in terms of:

*avoiding irreversible losses of biodiversity.
*seeking alternative solutions that minimize biodiversity losses.
*mitigation to restore any loss of biodiversity.
*compensation for unavoidable loss by providing substitutes of at least similar biodiversity value.
*highlighting opportunities for enhancement.

This approach can be called &quot;positive planning for biodiversity.&quot; It helps achieve no net loss of biodiversity by ensuring:

*Priorities and targets for biodiversity at international, national, regional and local level are respected, and a positive contribution to achieving them is made.

*Damage is avoided to unique, endemic, threatened or declining species, habitats and ecosystems; to species of high cultural value to society, and to ecosystems providing important services.

===Guiding Principles===

The ‘Convention on Biological Diversity’ advocates an &quot;ecosystem approach&quot; to impact assessment because people and biodiversity depend on healthily functioning ecosystems that have to be assessed in an integrated way, not constrained by artificial boundaries. The ecosystem approach is participatory and requires a long-term perspective based on a biodiversity-based study area and adaptive management to deal with the dynamic nature of ecosystems, uncertainty and the often unpredictable nature of ecosystem functions, behavior and responses. Biodiversity concerns are not limited to protected areas. Elements of natural systems remain in even the most urbanized cities and play an often important role in the quality of life in those cities.

Traditional rights and uses of biodiversity are recognized in IA and the benefits from commercial use of biodiversity are shared fairly. Needs of future should be considered as well as current generations (inter-generational needs).  Alternatives should be sought that do not trade in biodiversity &quot;capital&quot; to meet short term needs, where this could jeopardize the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

The precautionary principle is applied in any situation where important biodiversity may be threatened and there is insufficient knowledge to either quantify risks or implement effective mitigation. Application of the precautionary principle requires that development consent should be delayed while steps are taken to ensure that best available information can be obtained through consultation with local stakeholders/experts and/or new information on biodiversity can be obtained/consolidated.

An evironmental assessments involves consulting widely to ensure that all stakeholders have been consulted and that important biodiversity values are taken into account. Valuation of biodiversity can only be done in negotiation with the different groups or individuals in society (stakeholders) who have an interest in biodiversity. Use traditional and indigenous knowledge wherever appropriate. Work carefully with indigenous communities to ensure that knowledge of biodiversity is not inappropriately exploited.

===Operating Principles===

====Screening====

Biodiversity inclusive screening criteria are used to determine whether important biodiversity resources may be affected.

Biodiversity screening &quot;triggers&quot; for IA should include:
• Potential impacts on protected areas and areas supporting protected species.
• Impacts on other areas that are not protected but are important for biodiversity.
• Activities posing a particular threat to biodiversity (in terms of their type, magnitude, location, duration, timing, reversibility).
• Areas that provide important biodiversity services including extractive reserves, indigenous people's territories, wetlands, fish breeding grounds, soils prone to erosion, relatively undisturbed or characteristic habitat, flood storage areas, groundwater recharge areas, etc.
Encourage development of a biodiversity screening map indicating important biodiversity values and ecosystem services. If possible, integrate this activity with the development of a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and/or biodiversity planning at sub-national levels (e.g., regions, local authorities, towns) to identify conservation priorities and targets.

====Scoping====

Scoping leads to Terms of Reference for IA, defining the issues to be studied and the methods that will be used. Use scoping as an opportunity to raise awareness of biodiversity concerns and discuss alternatives to avoid or minimize negative impacts on biodiversity.

It is good practice to produce a scoping report for consultation. This should address the following issues (on the basis of existing information and any preliminary surveys or discussions):

* The type of project, program, plan or policy, possible alternatives and a summary of activities likely to affect biodiversity
* An analysis of opportunities and constraints for biodiversity (include &quot;no net biodiversity loss&quot; or &quot;biodiversity restoration&quot; alternatives)
* Expected biophysical changes (in soil, water, air, flora, fauna)resulting from proposed activities or induced by any socioeconomic changes
* Spatial and temporal scale of influence, identifying effects on connectivity between ecosystems, and potential cumulative effects
* Available information on baseline conditions and any anticipated trends in biodiversity in the absence of the proposal
* Likely biodiversity impacts associated with the proposal in terms of composition, structure and function
* Biodiversity services and values identified in consultation with stakeholders and anticipated changes in these (highlight any irreversible impacts)
* Possible measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for significant biodiversity damage or loss, making reference to any legal requirements
* Information required to support decision making and summary of important gaps
*Proposed IA methodology and timescale
*For practical use, develop in-country (sectoral) guidance translating this generic scoping sequence into tools, such as guidelines and sample Terms of Reference.

===Survey===

Address biodiversity at all appropriate levels and allow for enough survey time to take seasonal features into account. Focus on processes and services which are critical opportunity to raise awareness of biodiversity concerns and discuss
alternatives to avoid or minimize negative impacts on biodiversity.

The CIAI recommends basing the assessment on the following questions:

At the gene level, to what extent will the proposal have significant effects on:
*Genetic diversity of species, particularly rare and declining species and those with identified as priorities in NBSAPs and/or subnational biodiversity plans?
*Opportunities for species populations to interact, e.g., by increasing habitat fragmentation and isolation?
*Risk of extinction?
*Persistence of locally-adapted populations?

At the species level, to what extent will the proposal:
*Alter the species-richness or species-composition of habitats in the study area?
*Alter the species-composition of communities?
*Cause some species to be lost from the area?
*Affect species identified as priorities in NBSAPs and/or subnational biodiversity plans?
*Increase the risk of invasion by alien species?

At the ecosystem level, to what extent will the proposal:
*Change the amount, quality or spatial organization of habitat?
*Affect plans to enhance habitat availability or quality?
*Damage ecosystem processes and services, particularly those on which local communities rely?

Finally:
*If habitats will be lost or altered, is alternative habitat available to support associated species populations?
*Are there opportunities to consolidate or connect habitats?
Take an ecosystem approach and involve relevant stakeholders (including local communities). Consider the full range of factors affecting biodiversity. These include direct drivers of change associated with a proposal (e.g., land conversion and vegetation removal leading to loss of habitat-a key driver of biodiversity loss, emissions, disturbance, introduction of alien and genetically modified species, etc.); and indirect drivers of change which are harder to quantify, including demographic, economic, socio-political, cultural and technological processes or interventions.

Evaluate impacts of alternatives with reference to the baseline situation.
Compare against thresholds and objectives for biodiversity. Use NBSAPs, sub-national biodiversity plans and other conservation reports for information and objectives. Take into account cumulative threats and impacts resulting either from repeated impacts of projects of the same or different nature over space and time, and/or from proposed plans, programs or policies.

Biodiversity is influenced by cultural, social, economic and biophysical factors. Cooperation between different specialists in the IA team is thus essential, as is the integration of findings which have bearing on biodiversity.
Provide insight into cause-effect chains. If possible, quantify the changes in quality and amount of biodiversity. Explain the expected consequences of any biodiversity losses associated with the proposal, including the costs of replacing biodiversity services if they will be damaged by a proposal. Find out how these relate to relevant biodiversity priorities and objectives or any legal obligations? Indicate the legal issues that create the boundary conditions for decision making.

====Mitigation====
 
Remedial action can take several forms, i.e., avoidance (or prevention), mitigation (including restoration and rehabilitation of sites), and compensation. Apply the &quot;positive planning approach,&quot; where avoidance has priority and compensation is used as a last resort measure.
Avoid &quot;excuse&quot;-type compensation. Look for opportunities to positively enhance biodiversity. Acknowledge that compensation will not always be possible; there will still be cases where it is appropriate to say &quot;no&quot; to development proposals on grounds of irreversible damage to biodiversity.

====Review for decision-making====
Peer review of environmental reports with regard to biodiversity should be undertaken by a specialist with appropriate expertise, where biodiversity impacts are significant. Depending on the level of confidentiality of public decision-making, consideration should be given to the involvement of affected groups and civil society.

====Decision making====
Avoid pitting conservation goals against development goals; balance conservation with sustainable use for economically viable, and socially and ecologically sustainable solutions. For important biodiversity issues, apply the precautionary principle where information is insufficient and the no net loss principle in relation to irreversible losses associated with the proposal.

===Management, monitoring, evaluation and auditing===
It is important to recognize that all prediction of biodiversity response to perturbation is uncertain, especially over long time frames. Management systems and programs, including clear management targets (or Limits of Acceptable Change (LC)) and appropriate monitoring, should be set in place to ensure that mitigation is effectively implemented, unforeseen negative effects are detected and addressed, and any negative trends are detected. 
Provision is made for regular auditing of impacts on biodiversity. Provision should be made for emergency response measures and/or contingency plans where upset or accident conditions could threaten biodiversity.

{{Java Programming/ConcurrentTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Java's Remote Method Invocation (commonly referred to as RMI) is used for client and server models. RMI is the object oriented equivalent to [[w:Remote procedure call|RPC (Remote procedure call)]].

The Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) system allows an object running in one Java Virtual Machine (VM) to invoke methods on an object running in another Java VM. RMI provides for remote communication between programs written in the Java programming language.

RMI is defined to use only with the Java platform. If you need to call methods between different language environments, use [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]]. With [[w:Common Object Request Broker Architecture|CORBA]] a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.

== STUB and SKELETON ==

The remote method invocation goes through a STUB on the client side and a so called SKELETON on the server side.
 CLIENT --&gt; STUB --&gt; ... ''Network'' ... --&gt; SKELETON --&gt; REMOTE OBJECT

Prior to Java 1.2 the skeleton had to be explicitly generated with the ''rmic'' tool. Since 1.2 a dynamic skeleton is used, which employs the features of Java Reflection to do its work.

== rmiregistry ==
Remote objects can be listed in the RMI Registry. Clients can get a reference to the remote object by querying the Registry. After that, the client can call methods on the remote objects. (Remote object references can also be acquired by calling other remote methods. The Registry is really a 'bootstrap' that solves the problem of where to get the initial remote reference from.)

The RMI Registry can either be started within the server JVM, via the ''LocateRegistry.createRegistry()'' API, or a separate process called ''rmiregistry'' that has to be started before remote objects can be added to it, e.g. by the command line in Unix:
{{XConsole|1='''rmiregistry on Unix'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;
rmiregistry &lt;port&gt; &amp;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
or under Windows:
{{XConsole|1='''rmiregistry on Windows'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;
start rmiregistry &lt;port&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

If ''port'' is not specified the default 1099 is used. The client will need to connect to this ''port'' to access the Registry.

The Registry can also be started from a program by calling the following code:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 1: rmiregistry starting'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
...
Registry reg = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(iPort);
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Objects passed in as parameters to the remote objects's methods will be passed by value. If the remote object changes the passed-in object values, it won't be reflected on the client side, this is opposite what happens when a local object is called. Objects that used as parameters for remote methods invocation must implement the &lt;code&gt;java.io.Serializable&lt;/code&gt; interface, as they are going to be serialized when passed through the network, and a new object will be created on the other side.

However, exported remote objects passed as parameters are passed by remote reference.

== rmic tool ==
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Complete this section.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== RMI Remote object ==

The remote object has to either extend the &lt;code&gt;java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject&lt;/code&gt; object, or be explicitly exported by calling the &lt;code&gt;java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject()&lt;/code&gt; method.

== RMI clients ==
Here is an example of RMI client:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-10&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 7.10: HelloClient.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class HelloClient{

    private HelloClient() {}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = (args.length &lt; 1) ? null : args[0];
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry(host);
            Hello stub = (Hello) registry.lookup(&quot;Hello&quot;);
            String response = stub.sayHello();
            System.out.println(&quot;response: &quot; + response);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println(&quot;Client exception: &quot; + e.toString());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Chinese tractors are being imported in increasing numbers by dealers and individuals who find them useful on hobby farms, small farms, etc. due to their attractive pricing.  A typical Chinese tractor owner is someone who has some mechanical ability  and who is not averse to doing much of his own maintenance and repair.  Typical manuals provided by the Chinese manufacturers are brief, unclear, poorly worded and incomplete. Due to the size of the market, third-party manuals are rare. One easy to read and understand example is the Operators manual prepared in the UK for Siromer tractors. Siromer tractors are built in the Jinma plant at Yancheng, Jiangsu Province. But many owners &quot;learn by doing&quot;, often with the help of dealers and other tractor owners who participate in on-line forums or at the Chinese Tractor Owners Association which is a site dedicated to owners and dealers of these tractors. This site is located at www.ctoa.net .  A collaborative book in which experienced and &quot;newbie&quot; tractor owners alike can contribute their experience and knowledge would be an immense help to those owners who need more information to aid them in maintaining their tractors.

== Tractor Models ==
=== Generic ===
This section contains generic information that is applicable to most tractor models.
==== Operation ====
===== Starting =====
The starting procedure is as follows:
* Ensure that the fuel flow valve is turned on. This valve is either on the bottom of the fuel tank where the fuel exits the tank or it is on the sediment bowl.
* Sit on the operator's seat and depress the clutch.
* Put the transmission in neutral.
* Set throttle to a little bit above the idle setting.
* If the engine is cold (not warm to the touch) then do the following:
** If the engine has glow plugs set the ignition switch to the Heater (glow plug) position for 3 to 20 seconds. Leave the ignition switch in this position for only a short period of time. The colder the air temperature is the longer you leave it in this position. If the air temperature is 60F you can try 3 seconds. For an air temperature of 20F you might try 20 seconds. You do not want to stay in this ignition switch position for an extended period since it will significantly shorten the life of the glow plugs.
** NOTE: The first few times that you do this note the current draw on the amp/charging meter. If during a future engine start you see a lower current draw, one or more glow plugs may have burned out.
* Do the following if your tractor has a Compression Release knob and the engine is cold (or you can do it for every engine start):
** The Compression Release steps can be done while waiting for glow plugs to warm up.
** Locate the Compression Release knob.
** Pull/turn the Compression Release knob to the release position and hold it in the release position. It can require a significantly strong pull/twist to move the knob. It has to push against all of the intake and exhaust valve springs to release the compression.
* Turn the ignition switch to engage the starter.Do not run starter motor more than 20 to 25 seconds or damage to the windings may result.
* If you are using the Compression Release knob:
** Watch oil pressure to ensure oil pressure reaches normal operating pressure. Although this is not strictly required it does ensure that the engine is fully lubricated before encountering the stress of firing cylinders. This will prolong the life of the engine.
** Release the Compression Release knob. The spinning mass of the engine parts ensures that the engine will turn over with compression fairly rapidly (faster than the starter alone under compression) to ease starting. Since the engine now has compression it should start.
* When the engine fires turn the ignition switch back to the run position.
* If the engine does not start wait 10 seconds and try again.

=== Jinma ===
Jinma tractors are manufactured by Jiangsu Yueda Yancheng Tractor Manufacture Co., Ltd.
Jinma makes tractors that are also rebranded. The Jinmas can also be found under the following brands:
* international Rhino
* Ag Pro
* Farm Pro
* NorTrac
* AgKing
* Rural King
* Siromer
* Emery Built

==== Jinma Models JM204, JM254LE, JM284LE ====
These models have the same body, just different engines.

==== Jinma Models JM304, JM354LE ====
These two models have the same body, just different engines.

=== KAMA ===
KAMA tractors is a brand name that has been applied to tractors manufactured by Shandong Worldbest Shatuo Company limited. In late 2006, the company was reorganized as a stock company but continues to operate as Shandong Tractor Works.  The factory is located in Yanzhou City in the Shandong Province of China.  The factory uses the KAMA name which it adopted when part of Woldbest KAMA at some time in the past.  The common name for tractors produced by this factory is TaiShan, named for a famous mountain located nearby.

Shandong Tractor Works has approximately 5000 employees and is one of the oldest and largest tractor factories in China. The company have their own foundry, machine shops and assembly lines on site. They produce 2 and 4 cylinder diesel engines used in tractors and in other applications.  None of these engines have EPA approval for sale in the USA so the company purchases engines from othe Chinese engine companies with EPA compliant engines.

==== KAMA 454, 554 ====
The KAMA KM454 and KM554 were developed in conjunction with a European company and offer some enhanced design features not commonly found on Chinese tractors such as constant mesh transmission and wet disk brakes. Shandong Tractor factory was the first Chinese factory to offer a &quot;Shuttle shift&quot; device on the transmission to allow simple shifting from forward to reverse in the same gear ratio.

== Tractor Model Page(s) Sub-Sections For Manual Authors ==

Each tractor model or group of closely related models have their own page containing information specific to the model or group of models. To keep the size of pages from growing too large, page size will be kept &lt; 30k bytes. This will main that some models  will have many pages of information.

To have a consistent look throughout the manual the following hierarchy and order of information for a tractor model is highly recommended. If some subsection may not apply to a particular model (example: shuttle shift) then leave the section our of the page(s) for the tractor model. 

*Specifications
*Operation (Starting, Break-in, Normal Operation, Operating Limits)
*Fluid Capacities (Engine oil, coolant, differential, power steering, hydraulic system
*Maintenance Schedule (pre-startup,50,100,...hour maintenance
*Engine (May want to link to a page specific to the engine model so that information is not repeated).

[[Image:light-wave.png|thumb|This is a light wave frozen in time and shows the two components of light; an electric field and a magnetic field that oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a transverse wave).]]

The classical view of light is simply a wave.  This wave has two orthogonal (perpendicular) components.  These are an electric field and a magnetic field.  In the diagram shown the light is traveling to the right, the electric field is in the same plane as the page, and the magnetic field is traveling in and out of the page.  All three of these are perpendicular to each other.  The electric and magnetic component share anti-nodes.  Anti-nodes are the points where the wave passes through the zero and changes sign.  Since both waves are similar it is possible to refer to the wavelength of light, and not just the wavelength of the electric component of light.  

==Photoelectric Effect==
The '''Photoelectric effect''' is the emission of electrons from metal when it is shined on by light. The amount of electrons released depends on the type of metal and the frequency of the light. For some metals, if the light is below a certain frequency, it will not emit any electrons. Light was originally thought as a form of energy, but for this to be true, electrons would have been emitted, regardless of the frequency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=More Features of an XML Stylesheet=

In the last chapter, a stylesheet was created to simply output text from the XML document to a HTML page.  The presentation of a document can be formatted using table to layout the content for display.  In addition, a different background color, font size, font weight, and alignment can be defined using the style tag in HTML to design the output page.  Table 3-3 shows the features mentioned. Note that HTML commands are uppercase.

Example: &lt;!--This is a Named Custom SimpleType that is called from Hotel whenever someone types in an email address--&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Table 3-3:  XML Stylesheet for a one-to-many relationship &lt;/small&gt;'''


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; &gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color:linen&quot;&gt;
The output can be formatted using HTML tables for layout with an XML stylesheet.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Refers to Chapter 2 - A single entity for steps in using NetBeans to create the above XML stylesheet.

Output result of the above stylesheet (city_hotel.xsl) using city_hotel.xml that validate with city_hotel.xsd:  [[link to city_hotel.html]]

==Regex==
Special regular expression (regex) language can be used to construct a pattern.  The regex language in XML Schema is based on Perl’s regular expression language.  The following are some common notations:

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; bgcolor=&quot;FFFFCC&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;. (the period) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any character at all &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\d &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any digit &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\D &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any non-digit &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\w &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any word (alphanumeric) character &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\W &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any non-word character (i.e. -, +, =) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\s &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any white space (including space, tab, newline, and return) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\S &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;for any character that is not white space &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x* &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have zero or more x's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(xy)* &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have zero or more xy's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x+ &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;repetition of the x, at least once&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x? &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have one or zero x's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(xy)? &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;To have one or no xy's &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[abc] &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to include one of a group of values &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[0-9] &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to include the range of values from 0 to 9 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x{5} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have exactly 5 x's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x{5,} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have at least 5 x's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x{5,8} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;at least 5 but at most 8 x's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(xyz){2} &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to have exactly 2 xyz's (in a row) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; bgcolor=&quot;FFFFCC&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

For example, the pattern for validating a Social Security Number is \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}

The prior schema code has a check for &lt;b&gt;emailAddressType&lt;/b&gt; \w+\W*\w*@{1}\w+\W*\w+.\w+.*\w* &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[w+]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;at least one word (alphanumeric) character,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. answer &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[W*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by none, one or many non-word character(s),&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. -&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w*@{1}]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by any (or none) word character and one at-sign,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. my@ &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w+]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by at least one word character, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. mail&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[W*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by none, one or many non-word character(s),&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. _&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w+.]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;followed by at least one word character and period,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. please.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w+.*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;zero to infinite times followed by the previous string,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. opentourism. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[w*]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;finally followed by none, one or many word character(s)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;e. g. org&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;email-address: &lt;b&gt;answer-my@mail_please.opentourism.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Table 4-3:  XML style sheet for a one-to-one relationship – [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/country_dest.xsl country_dest.xsl]&lt;/small&gt;'''

The XML style sheet in Table 4-3 introduces the if statement as well as the ability to sort elements.&lt;br&gt;
The if statement executes code based on the evaluation of the condition given in the &quot;test&quot; attribute,e.g.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;xsl:if test=&quot;population &amp;amp;gt;= 10000&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Big Town&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;xsl:if test=&quot;population &amp;amp;lt; 10000&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Small Town&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Possible expressions for the condition are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;H3&gt;Operator&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;H3&gt;Meaning&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;lt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;less than&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;greater than&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;lt;=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;less than or equal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;gt;=&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;greater than or equal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;and&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;logical and-conjunction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;or&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;logical or-conjunction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Output can be sorted based on the value of the select attribute of the &lt;xsl:sort&gt; element.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting an Open Source Compiler==



With a fast internet connection, gcc &amp;mdash; a free compiler that can compile C, C++, and Fortran, as well as other languages and works on Windows &amp;mdash; can be obtained through [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]. When installing Cygwin, select to install the &quot;devel/gcc&quot; package and optionally also &quot;graphics/opengl&quot;, depending on what type of program you're planning to write. Another Windows port of the GCC compiler collection is [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows)], an approximately 10MB download 1/10th the size of Cygwin. You could also download [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp DJGPP], but it is designed more for 32-bit console programs. An alternative to obtaining the gcc compiler via porting is to compile from command line within a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization virtualized] version of Linux, which not only comes with gcc, but whose kernel &quot;... is written in the version of the C programming language supported by GCC...&quot; 

=== Command Line GCC Illustration ===
To compile, open a command-line interface and use the commands:

 c:\cygwin\bin\gcc -s -Os -mno-cygwin -o &lt;outputfilename&gt; &lt;inputfilename&gt;

for command-line programs and

 c:\cygwin\bin\gcc -s -Os -mwindows -mno-cygwin -o &lt;outputfilename&gt; &lt;inputfilename&gt; -lopengl32 -lwinmm

for GUI programs.

Description of command-line flags:
* -s: makes the output program smaller by stripping out information that is useful for debugging crashed applications
* -Os: optimizes for size (-O3 for execution speed)
* -mno-cygwin: makes the program work without any external nonstandard .dll-files
* -mwindows: makes it a GUI application
* -lopengl32: optionally lets you use OpenGL for graphics
* lwinmm: optionally adds some multimedia support such as sound, joysticks, and high resolution timers

One must be in the bin directory of Cygwin in order to compile with Cygwin, whereas in Linux gcc is already aliased to work in all directories.

=== Graphical Integrated Development Environments ===

For a more user-friendly environment, like Visual Studio, an excellent open source IDE for Windows is Bloodshed's [http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html Dev-C++]. It has a well-organised Graphical User Interface, and comes with everything necessary for setting up a Windows C/C++ development environment, installing and using the Mingw port of GCC by default (though it can be configured to work in combination any other GCC-based compiler such as Cygwin). Its source (written in Delphi) is available from the Bloodshed Website, as are the pre-compiled binaries. Dev-C++ has not been updated in quite some time, though, and alternatives like [http://www.codeblocks.org Code::Blocks] or [http://codelite.org/ CodeLite] have since emerged. [http://www.netbeans.org Netbeans] is an IDE developed by Sun Microsystems as the official IDE for Java however Netbeans now supports multiple languages and is very extensible via its plugin system. Another open source IDE is [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse], which was initially developed by IBM. One more IDE, created specifically for C++, is [http://www.ultimatepp.org/ Ultimate++].

== GCC, DJGPP, MinGW and others==
These are three well-known FOSS development toolsets for compiling applications, although they function in a way slightly different to Microsoft and Borland's Windows programming tools. 

===GCC===
''GCC'' stands for the ''GNU Compiler Collection''. Although it provides support for compiling sources in several programming languages, it is most commonly used for C and C++ code. Because it is a compiler and not an IDE, approaches such as DJGPP wrap some more arcane details away from the user, easing the creation of programs, as well as providing other features, described below.

===DJGPP===
'''DJGPP''' is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by DJ Delorie since 1989. It is a DOS application with 32-bit awareness and allows the creation of software with DPMI support. As a combined port of GCC and other GNU utilities, it is commonly used to write, compile and debug console applications. It can make use of libraries such as Allegro, in order to create applications with graphics, Other add-ons extend its functionality. It has support for cross-platform development, meaning that you may create software without needing a physical instance of a target machine type or operating system in order to build the executable that will be shipped to that configuration. 

===MinGW===
'''MinGW''' stands for the ''Minimalist GNU for Windows'' and includes the needed header files for using the Win32 API; it supports creation of native Windows executables. As of late December 2006, Wikipedia defines the goal of MinGW as to &quot;provide only a free compiler and toolchain, prioritizing performance&quot;. This contrasts the Cygwin objective of creating a POSIX compliant development environment. Like DJGPP, it can be used for cross-platform development. Because MinGW is available for other systems outside of Windows (such as Linux), even developers lacking a copy of Windows can create Win32 API applications. Furthermore, PE executables (.exe files) can be run using the WINE program (which translates Windows API calls to the corresponding UNIX system functions) to get a taste of what the application will look like - without actually having to install Windows.

===Dev-C++===
Dev-C++ is a free graphical IDE that comes packaged with MinGW and can also use the Cygwin compiler.

===Other tools===
GCC, DJGPP and MinGW do not have support for graphic-oriented resource and GUI editing commonly needed for Windows programming. 

However open source libraries such as QT, GTK+ and wxWidgets provide user interface frontends as well as simplified models wrapping around the complexities of the Windows API. The minimal trade-off is that these may require special licensing and the bundling of runtime DLLs. 

== Cygwin ==
'''Cygwin''' is an environment made for Windows that emulates Unix behavior. It can be obtained from cygwin.com via a small setup.exe package that when run, asks for a selection of features that are then fetched. A fast internet connection is suggested, since Cygwin comprises many non-trivial shells, programs, and even GUIs.

The setup program allows the user to download the following parts, among others:

* Bash shell
* Development tools, with debugger, several languages supported by gcc compilers, as well as AWK, SED, YACC and Bison support
* Network tools, such as ssh, lynx web browser, nmap, and others
* Programmer text editors, such as GNU Emacs, nano and vi
* X, which is a very difficult environment to fetch for free on Windows otherwise

The software, after selected, is downloaded and installed to a folder at the root of the user's hard drive. It does not repartition the drive, require installation of any Unix system nor use a disk image. Files are simply installed in a Unix hierarchy within the cygwin folder. 

To run Cygwin, the user will have a Start Menu program or Desktop shortcut called '''Cygwin Bash Shell'''. Upon opening it, a DOS-like window opens and displays a classic bash prompt. It is color coded, unlike its DOS underpinnings, and can interact with DOS by being aware of path settings and other system variables, so be aware of the fact that your Windows applications may be located from your system path variable and conflict with a folder's current filename because of DOS's implicit EXE extension expansion.

===Directory information===

As an added detail, if you need access to different drives in your computer, instead of using '''/mnt/''', you have to cd into '''/cygdrive/''' to see your drives listed. Seeing your C: drive's root, then, is just a matter of typing cd '''/cygdrive/c''' at the command line.

===Emacs editor information===
When using Emacs, the normal key combination to exit the program has no effect, by default, though adept users will probably find an Emacs keybinding trick to overcome this issue. Thus, when you want to exit the editor from command line mode, you may end up getting tired, and suspend the program to do a later kill of the process at the command line. Instead of pressing C-x C-c, to leave emacs, you must press F10 to get the menu. Once there, press f and then e. This summons the File Menu and later its Exit option, returning to the command line and prompting for the appropriate saving when some changed files need to be committed to disk.

===Compiling without Cygwin library bindings===
Compiling with g++, as stated in a previous section, needs to include the appropriate flags. gcc will normally bind the executable code to the cygwin1.dll file, unless your gcc flags explicitly include &quot;-mno-cygwin&quot; as a switch. To solve this, you can add this and all other switches to your .bashrc file, by using a known Unix option:

Open the .bashrc file at your Cygwin home directory in any editor. Look for the lines starting with &quot;alias&quot;. There, you will see some shell commands tweaked to have specific options. Under the line containing

 alias l='ls -CF'

you may add:

 alias g++='g++ -mno-cygwin' #do not depend on cygwin1.dll on target system

In case you need to add more fine tuning tags, you may either add them to that same line after the -mno-cygwin switch, or just re-alias the g++ command so that the shell stacks up the current meaning of g++ to further tags. For example, you may add

 alias g++='g++ -Wno-deprecated' #silence deprecation talk. 

To keep the g++ compiler from reminding you about the standard practice of including &lt;string&gt; instead of the now deprecated &lt;string.h&gt; header.

===No root nor su switching===
Cygwin was created with a few differences in mind. It does not have a different root account, though it may claim files are owned by the '''Administrator''' user. Though this may be beyond the scope of the book, it is worth a line or two to say that you won't easily be able to experiment with programs that run under different user rights, because it does not seem that Cygwin tries to enforce account security. You may read any file in the OS that Windows allows Cygwin to access.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==

Windows was originally a 16-bit graphical layer for MS-DOS that was written by Microsoft. As it grew, it gained the ability to handle 32-bit programs and eventually became totally 32-bit when Windows NT and 2000 came out. After Windows 95, Microsoft began to remove dependencies on DOS and finally fully implemented the separation in Windows 2000.  Windows has many advanced features as well as many platform specific problems.  It possesses an Application Programming Interface that consists of thousands of mostly undocumented GUI functions as well as having varying degrees of MS-DOS compatibility.  Additionally, with the advent of NT (New Technology), Windows relies completely on the NT kernel instead of its MS-DOS subsystem, the NT kernel is capable of emulating the necessary DOS functionality. In addition to the NT kernel, Microsoft has also introduced many API wrappers, such as the MFCs (Microsoft Foundation Classes), COM (Component Object Model), and .NET technologies.

The most popular languages for use on Windows include [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic|Visual Basic/VB6]] and [[Programming:c|C/C++]], although C++ is quickly being replaced by the [[w:.NET_Framework|.NET]] platform, specifically [[C Sharp Programming|C#]] (C Sharp).

== Windows Kernels == 

Windows 1.0, 2.0, and 3.11 are considered to be an older generation of Windows systems that were built to be a simple graphical layer over the MS-DOS operating system. Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME were designed to bypass MS-DOS (although DOS was still present), and were all based on the same code structure known as the &quot;9x Kernel&quot;. Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server are all based on a collection of code known as the &quot;NT Kernel&quot;.

== System Architecture ==

The Windows NT Kernel is divided into several sections, here we will briefly discuss how the Windows operating system is put together. At the most basic level is the file NTOSKRNL.EXE, the kernel of the Windows operating system, and the most important file on your computer. If you are interested in seeing this for yourself, you can find it in the C:\Windows\System32 folder (this can also be found using the following path %systemroot%\system32 ) on your own Windows NT machines.

NTOSKRNL.EXE provides some of the basic functionality of Windows, but one file alone cannot make the whole system work. NTOSKRNL relies heavily on a '''Dynamic Link Library''' (DLL) known as HAL.DLL. HAL stands for &quot;Hardware Abstraction Layer&quot;, and is the portion of code that allows low-level mechanisms such as interrupts and BIOS communication to be handled independently.

If we consider Windows architecture as a layered architecture, with NTOSKRNL.EXE and HAL.DLL on the bottom layer, the next layer up contains two important files, NTDLL.DLL, and WIN32K.SYS. NTDLL contains a number of user-mode functions such as system call stubs and the run-time library (RTL) code, collectively known as the (largely undocumented) &quot;Native API&quot;. Much of the run-time library code is shared between NTOSKRNL and NTDLL. WIN32K.SYS is a kernel-mode driver that implements windowing and graphics, allowing for user interfaces to be created.

The next layer up contains a number of libraries that will be of primary interest to us. This layer comprises what is called the '''Win32 API''', and it contains (almost) all the functions that a user will need in order to program in Windows. The Win32 API is divided into 4 component parts, each one a .DLL:

;kernel32.DLL: This contains most of the system-related Win32 API functions. Most of these functions are just wrappers around the lower-level NTDLL functions, but some functionality such as National Language Support (NLS) and console handling are not available in NTDLL.

;advapi32.DLL: This contains other system-related functions such as registry and service handling.

;gdi32.DLL: This contains a number of basic functions for drawing. These functions are all relatively simple, and allow the user to draw shapes (circles, rectangles, etc.) on the screen, to display and manipulate bitmaps, etc. 

;user32.DLL: This contains a number of functions that implement the familiar user-interface of Windows. Programs, message boxes, prompts, etc are all implemented using the User32 functions. User32 performs its tasks by calling system calls implemented by WIN32K.SYS.

In addition to the 4 primary libraries in the Win32 API, there are a number of other important libraries that a Windows programmer should become familiar with:

;MSVCRT.DLL: MSVCRT.DLL is the dynamic link library that contains the implementations of the C standard library ('''stdlib''') functions that C programmers should be familiar with. These are the functions defined in the common header files stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h, etc.

;WS2_32.DLL: This is the Winsock2 library, that contains the standard Berkeley socket API for communicating on the internet. We will talk about winsock programming later in this book.

== Windows Does It ==

The Windows system, it might be surprising for some people to learn, is a very hands-on system. This is not a familiar concept for people who are just beginning C programming using the standard library. In a normal software project, there is typically a main function, and the main function in turn calls other functions that are defined in your project. In a Windows function, typically the programmer provides function pointers to the system, and Windows will make calls ''into your program''. Also, in a Windows program, your code will sit idle when there is nothing to be done. Using the '''message loop architecture''', Windows will send messages to your program when an event needs to be handled, and the program responds to the messages. If the program doesn't respond, the message is ignored. 

For each program, Windows sets up a message queue structure to handle the message transmission process. Windows will maintain a listing of all the objects and system resources in use by a program, and will assign each one a '''handle'''. These handles are useless by themselves, but they can be passed to the system to reference particular objects and resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Windows Platform SDK ==

The Microsoft Windows '''Software Development Kit''' is a simple, free set of tools and libraries to create windows programs in C and C++. The SDK contains the standard windows header files, the link libraries, the compiler (cl.exe), and the linker (link.exe). The SDK is available as a free download from Microsoft.

[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&amp;displaylang=en Download the SDK]

== Visual Studio ==

Another option is [http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/ Microsoft Visual C++], a commercial IDE and is an option worth looking into for serious Windows programmers. MSVC++ is almost a de facto standard Windows programming IDE.

The best option for a beginner is Microsoft's .NET platform.  .NET developers can use [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/ Microsoft Visual Studio.NET], Borland C#Builder (discussed earlier), the [http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/ Visual Studio Express products] and [http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/ SharpDevelop].

The Visual Studio Express products are Microsoft-provided stripped down versions of Visual Studio, designed to provide an entry-level product for Windows programmers. They are currently free and in beta, but they are expected to become a low-priced commercial product once they are released.  As of this writing, Visual Studio Express supports Managed C++, C#, Visual Basic .NET, and J# for Windows programming. All Visual Studio Express products use the same compilers as the commercial Visual Studio .NET.

== Borland Compiler ==

In addition, Borland has released several of its compilers for free (although still proprietary) as [http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html Borland Command Line compiler tools]. Borland requires users to log in in order to download these tools. They are quite small and fast, more so than gcc and DJGPP, and can build Windows applications with ease, especially for those accustomed with Borland tools.

Other notable downloads from Borland are [http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilderx.html C++BuilderX] and 
and [http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_csharpbuilder.html C#Builder], both with IDEs. Both products impose restrictions on your software and must not be for commercial use.

== Other Tools ==

SharpDevelop is a free and small IDE. It supports C# and partially supports Visual Basic.NET. However, you also need to obtain [http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx Microsoft's .NET SDK], which can be freely downloaded from Microsoft's site.

It's also possible to develop Windows programs in [[Forth]] (see [[w:Forth | the Forth article at Wikipedia]]) using WinForth, Win32Forth, SwiftForth, and RetroForth. Several of these can generate native Windows applications with much less bloat than C/C++.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the DDK? ==

Microsoft offers a free '''Driver Development Kit''', for people who are interested in writing device drivers, system services, and other kernel-mode code. The DDK comes with a number of different libraries, extensive documentation, link libraries, a special compiler and linker, and many examples for new driver programmers.

This book discusses the DDK in depth in throughout Section 4, but specifically in [[Windows Programming/The DDK|the chapter about the DDK]].

== Obtaining the DDK ==

The DDK is available free from microsoft, but not as a download. To obtain the DDK, you must order the software on CD, and this comes with a small shipping and handling fee. The DDK has a number of different options, and installing the DDK with every option will require a large amount of disk space.

The DDK used to be available as a download, but to conserve bandwidth, Microsoft has changed their policy to only offer the DDK as a CD. The SDK, and a number of other CDs are also available to order from Microsoft for free (plus shipping and handling), so this might be worthwhile to check out as well.

Many people claim that Microsoft has discontinued the use of MASM, but this is not the case. MASM is still maintained by Microsoft for use in house, and is updated on a needs basis. This means that MASM is only updated when presented with a specific need, such as the migration to 64 bits, or the migration to Vista. MASM comes as part of the standard DDK distribution (on the CD), and can also be found for download on the Internet, or can be ordered separately by contacting Microsoft sales and service at 1-800-426-9400.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Antibiotics==
Oral antibiotics are usually the first line of defence prescribed by doctors to relieve papules, pustules, inflammation and some redness. There are two families of antibiotics normally used, traditionally the tetracycline family and now macrolide families[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15562139&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus] have been proven to help treat rosacea. Antibiotics are used for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than their ability to kill micro-organisms. Generally they are prescribed in quantities too small for them to be effective at stopping the growth of micro-organisms.

The Tetracyclines family include: Aureomycin, Demeclocycline,  Doxycycline, Minocycline, Oxytetracycline and Tetracycline.

Tetracycline use should be avoided during pregnancy and in the very young (less than 6 years) because it will result in permanent staining of teeth causing an unsightly cosmetic result.

Doxycycline is commonly prescribed by medical doctors for infections and to treat acne. It may also be used to treat urinary tract infections, gum disease, and other bacterial infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Doxycycline is also used commonly as a prophylactic treatment for infection by Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). It is also effective against Yersinia pestis and malaria. At subantimicrobial doses, doxycycline is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, and has been used in various experimental systems for this purpose.

Oracea is a 40mg modified-release formulation of doxycycline that is taken once daily for the treatment of rosacea and is patented by Collagenex Pharmaceuticals. Oracea works by reducing inflammation.

Minocycline hydrochloride, also known as minocycline, is an antibiotic of the tetracycline class. It is marketed under several trade names, including Minomycin, and Dynacin. It is primarily used to treat acne.

Metronidazole can be taken orally or as a gel or cream. It is sold as MetroLotion&amp;reg;, Metrocream&amp;reg; and '''Metrogel&amp;reg;''' by Galderma Laboratories]] and as Noritate&amp;reg; by Dermik.

Metronidazole tastes very bitter, and can cause headaches. Long term or high dosage administration of metronidazole can lead to peripheral neuropathy, which often manifests itself as a tingling or numbness in the fingers or toes. Patients who experience neuropathy should stop taking the drug and immediately contact their physician. Patients taking metronidazole must avoid consuming alcohol in any form (including cough syrup), as it will react badly with the medication, leading to severe nausea and cramping. Another common side effect is the darkening of the urine. Patients should drink plenty of water to avoid constipation. Patients taking metronidazole have also reported loss of appetite and mild nausea. Forcing oneself to eat, despite lack of appetite and fatigue, may reduce the nausea.

==Clonidine==
Flushing and blushing can be reduced with a centrally-acting alpha-2 agonist Clonidine. Clonidine has side effects of drowsiness and lowered blood pressure. Moxonidine can be used as an alternative to Clonidine as it has less side effects but most people find Clonidine more effective. Beta-Blockers like Propanol are similar to alpha-2 agonists and work better for anxiety and chronic social blushing. More information about Clonidine can be found at the following page (http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/sadhelp/clonidine.htm).

==Beta blockers==
Beta blockers or beta-adrenergic blocking agents are a class of drugs used to treat a variety of cardiovascular conditions and some other diseases.

There are two types of beta receptors: &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptors located mainly in the heart, and &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-receptors located all over the body, but mainly in the lungs, muscles and arterioles.

Drugs that block beta 2 receptors generally have a relaxing effect and are prescribed for anxiety, migraine, esophageal varices and alcohol withdrawal syndrome, among others. Many beta blockers affect both type 1 and type 2 receptors; these are termed ''non-selective'' blockers. Some non-cardio selective beta blockers are Nadolol, Oxprenolol, Propranolol, Pindolol and Sotalol.

*[http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/rosacea-support/message/9717 Rosacea Support archives msg:9717] - A patient talks about their experiences with taking atenolol.

==Isotretinoin==
Isotretinoin is a powerful medication normally used for the treatment of acne but in low dosage can be used to treat rosacea. It is a retinoid, meaning it is derived from Vitamin A and is found naturally in the body, produced by the liver in small quantities. Isotretinoin is sold under many brand names, including '''Accutane&amp;reg;''' and '''Roaccutane&amp;reg;''' by Roche. It is also marketed as '''Accure&amp;reg;''' (Alphapharm), '''Oratane&amp;reg;''' (Douglas Pharmaceuticals), '''Isohexal&amp;reg;''' (Hexal Australia), '''Amnesteem&amp;reg;''' (Bertek) and '''Claravis&amp;reg;''' (Barr).

Isotretinoin is effective at treating rosacea but because of the many side effects it is normally prescribed after other treatments such as antibiotics have been tried. Isotretinoin is typically prescribed at between 0.5 mg/kg/day to 2.0 mg/kg/day for severe acne. For rosacea it is normally prescribed at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day to 1.0 mg/kg/day or lower. 

17 of a study of 20 patents in a follow up one year after stopping treatment had no relapses showing a long-lasting favourable effect in rosacea.&lt;ref name=&quot;iso2&quot;&gt;Turjanmaa K, Reunala T.

[[File:Lumenis_One_IPL.JPG|thumb|210px|IPL handpiece on a Lumenis One]]

Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) is a treatment where a broad spectrum of light is applied to the skin. IPL differs to dermatological lasers in that they emit a large spectrum of light while lasers emit a single wavelength, but in practice they are quite similar. IPL machines are expensive and the treatments are normally only available from dermatologists and beauty salons. Using different settings IPL machines can be used for treating vascular lesions, fine wrinkles and also for hair removal. For vascular treatments the goal is to destroy blood vessels in the inner layers of the skin by heating them to 70&amp;nbsp;°C. Although blood vessels are targeted, the light energy is also absorbed by other structures in the skin such as melanin (pigment for skin and hair) and water. IPL has only been around since 1995 and new research to maximise effectiveness while reducing side effects and new technologies and procedures are still being developed. 

=== IPL Machine ===
IPL machines are powered using a xenon flash lamp. Xenon, which is also used for camera flashes produces a flat spectrum of light from 400nm to 1200nm when excited with electricity. Different filters can be used to filter out lower wavelengths depending on the treatment performed. The size of the glass prism (spot size) varies between machines but at ~4.5x1cm they are much larger than typical lasers at ~1cm circle. A light pulse can be triggered by the operator using the hand piece. There is a delay between pulses while the capacitors recharge and the flash lamp cools down.

=== Settings ===
* ''Wavelength or Filter:'' A Xenon flash lamp produces a wavelength from 400nm to 1200nm. For vascular/rosacea treatments the light is filtered generally at the lower end. A 590nm filter would reduce the wavelength from 400-1200nm to 590-1200nm. Lower wavelengths penetrate lower and higher wavelengths penetrate more deeply into the skin.
* ''Fluence or energy level:'' The amount of energy applies over the whole pulse generally ranges from 20-60 joules per square centimetre (J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and may be spread over a series of short pulses. A joule is equal to 1 W·s (watt second).
* ''Pulse width:'' The duration of each pulse. Can be a single pulse or three short pulses.
* ''Repetition rate:'' The delay between the short pulses.
For the Matrix system of Medical Assist the settings are:
380nm-1800nm / upto 15 pulses times two. maximum 80 joules per square centimeter. This is the most powerfull IPL system in the world with the best effect. The machines are available in two different types, the first is a salon equipment and the other is a hospital use. Both are very reliable machines with high quality.

=== How it works ===
Selective photothermolysis. The absorption of haemoglobin is significantly higher than the absorption by melanin the skins natural pigment. The haemoglobin absorb the light heating up causing the blood vessel walls to heat up causing coagulation of the blood vessels which are eventually reabsorbed by the body and replaced by scar tissue. Their are two systems. The first one is a ELOS system, which is working only for 70% for black or dark hair with a white skin. It wont work for blond, red or grey hair. Also it is not safe to use on dark skin. The second system is a Matrix system from Medical Assist. This system works on a thin part of the hair follicle which is effective for all colours of hair and is safe for every type of skin.

=== Cost ===
Generally treatments are sold as single treatments or as discounted packages of five treatments with a period of 3-4 weeks or 6 weeks with the Matrix system, between each treatment. Prices per treatment are usually between US$300-700 (€230-500) but can vary depending on country, IPL machine type and the qualifications and skill of the operator.

=== Treatment procedure ===
Topical anaesthesia can be applied 10-30 minutes before the treatment. Eye protection is generally worn by the patient and the operator. The operator selects the settings based on the skin type and similar characterisitcs and proceeds with the treatment. Each pulse of the IPL feels like having a rubber band snapped against the face. The skin will be redder and painful after the treatment and improves over the day continues to improve for months after the treatment. Newer procedures include pre flushing using a heating pad on the back of the neck and macrolide antibiotics because of their anti-angiogenesis properties which stop the regrowth of blood vessels shortly after treatments. &lt;ref name=&quot;triple_pass&quot;&gt;Dr. Geoffrey Nase, PhD. ''Latest Advances: Triple-pass laser tx.'' Dermatology Times, 1 March 2005 Issue. [http://www.drnase.com/rosacea_photoderm.htm Full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risks/parameters that affect outcome ===
* For men if the area of facial hair growth is treated then it could result in temporary stunted hair growth and possible hair loss.
* If the patient has dark skin or has a tan or sunburn then this will reduce the effectiveness of the treatment, this is not for the Matrix system from Medical Asist which can treat all skin types and skin colors.
* If the operator presses too hard with the handpiece on your skin, the effectiveness of the treatment will be reduced because the blood will be pushed out of the area being treated.
* If the energy levels are too high then purpura or bruising can result. Purpura is the appearance of purple discolourations on the skin caused by bleeding underneath the skin. Purpura can last up to 2 weeks.
* Blisters
* Alcohol, isotretinoin

=== Effectiveness ===
{{sect-stub}}
In a study of 63 patents with telangiectasia owing to rosacea that were treated with IPL concluded that IPL is an effective tool in achieving meaningful and lasting rosacea clearance. The study found a mean clearance of 77.8% was achieved and was maintained for a follow-up period averaging 51.6 months (range 12-99 months).&lt;ref&gt;Schroeter CA, Haaf-von Below S, Neumann HA. ''Effective treatment of rosacea using intense pulsed light systems.'' Dermatol Surg. 2005 Oct;31(10):1285-9. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16188180&amp;query_hl=2 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

Another study was performed in order to detect the effect of IPL application with simultaneous topical antibiotics in inflammatory rosacea and to assess the efficacy of IPL therapy in routine treatment of rosacea.
Twenty patients aged between 34 and 70 with papulopustular rosacea (14 female and 7 male) were included in the study. Ten patients (group I) were treated for 21 weeks with topical metronidazole. The other ten patients (group II) received an additional 3 sessions with IPL 515-755 nm Photoderm VL technology over 4 weeks. Treatment effectiveness was recorded by digital visualisation and patient satisfaction scale before each IPL session.
In all patients, significant reductions in papulopustular elements were observed. Eight out of 10 patients (group I) still showed permanent erythema and telangiectasias despite topical treatment. In 3/10 patients a few telangiectasias remained following the treatment in contrast to 5/10 satisfied group I patients. MD Ferdinand Bisselink did a study on 116 patients for the treatment rosacea and found out that 103 from the 116 patients see that there whas a reduction of more as 70% after four treatments with the Medical Assist Matrix IPL system.

=== Trademarks and procedures ===
* Photoderm®: ESC Medical (now Lumenis) first introduced IPL machines for dermatological use in 1995. The Photoderm VL machine for vascular lesions was among the line-up and the treatments were often marketed as &quot;Photoderm&quot;.
* Photofacial™: A trade secret procedure developed by Dr. Patrick Bitter Sr. M.D. and Dr. Patrick Bitter Jr, who train IPL operators in their protocols for a fee.
* FotoFacial™: Dr. Patrick Bitter Jr later developed the Fotofacial protocol and the FotofacialRF using Syneron ELOS technology.
* Photorejuvenation is not trademarked.
* Intens Pulsed Light Matrix system is developed by Medical Assist (medicalassist@hotmail.com)

== Laser ==
[[File:Dermatological_laser.JPG|thumb|200px|Dermatological laser]]
Dermatological Lasers can be used to treat rosacea and work by applying a high energy single wavelength beam to the skin to target blood vessels. This heats them up, damaging them and they are then removed by the body's defence mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are still many insurance companies that refuse to cover Laser/IPL treatments because they view rosacea as a &quot;cosmetic concern&quot;. Here are some simple steps taken by previous rosacea sufferers to get insurance to reimburse both fully or partly.

Ring up your insurer and ask if it will be covered.  Even if your insurance company will cover the procedures, they usually require pre-certification outlining the number of treatments and type of laser. Prepare a submission outlying your rosacea symptoms and how they affect and limit your lifestyle. Get photos of your severe flushing so the insurance company can see what you are really dealing with. Include peer-reviewed articles photocopied from books or medical journals or printed from the Internet.

The following symptoms are viewed as cosmetic (less important): Papules, pustles, redness and visible telangiectasias. The following are not cosmetic (more important): Flushing, blushing, burning, itching, facial swelling and pain.

Other major points to include:
*A letter of medical necessity from a physician in your plan including the CPT code for the procedure.  (It was 17108 in 2003)
*A list of all other remedies you have tried (antibiotics, prescription topicals, diet and lifestyle changes, etc)
*In your letter explain that when lasers are used for cosmetic purposes the settings are different than when treating rosacea.  
*As of 2004 many Laser/IPL machines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/k030527.pdf Lumenis 510(k) submission]. URL accessed on 23 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;.

*If it is not treated it will progress into more advances stages
*You may be able to stop taking current rosacea medications after the Laser/IPL treatments

Be persistent.  Fax your request and then send it with signature verification of the recipient.  Call in a few days to confirm receipt, find out when the review committee will be meeting, follow up the day after that and keep on top of your request.  Document the names and dates of people you speak with, it may be beneficial if you need to appeal a rejection. If your claim is rejected, ask why your claim was rejected then refute those claims with evidence. Ask at one of the online support groups for help if you need it.

==Sample Letter==

Below is a sample letter that was used by Adam to convince his insurance company to provide full coverage.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear Committee Members:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My name is Adam. I am 19 years old. Dr. xxxxxx xxxxxxxx , M.D., my dermatologist, submitted
a request for Photoderm device coverage to alleviate my disabling rosacea. Dr. xxxxxx's request
on my behalf was denied based on your determination that this procedure would be a cosmetic
one. I believe you have made a mistake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


I have a tentative appointment set up to have my first Photoderm treatment on December 6, 2001
at Dr. xxxxxx's (different doc, this is the one who im actually getting the procedures done
by) Office based on your decision after reading this letter. I am not doing this for cosmetic
reasons - I am doing this for reasons that are medically necessary. My Rosacea is accompanied
by severe flushing, swelling, inflammation, and worst of all a disabling burning pain. My condition
is worsened by almost everything imaginable. Most foods, sun exposure, hot weather, warm rooms,
cold weather, wind, humidity, exercise, embarrassment, anger, mental concentration, stress,
facial movements such as chewing and smiling, certain medications, most topicals, lotions,
sunscreens, soaps, cleansers, showering, shaving, daily physical activities (walking up a flight
of stairs), cuddling up with someone, my head touching my pillow, and the heat from talking
on the phone, are just SOME of the things that I run into each and every day that cause my
facial pain to get substantially worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


I have tried numerous creams, lotions and oral medications in an effort to alleviate the severe
discomfort caused by my facial rosacea. The cost before insurance of all the prescription medications
I have used in connection with my condition since the beginning of this calendar year totals
over $2,500. In recent weeks I have begun experimenting with different antihistamines in an
attempt to reduce the swelling, inflammation, and pain associated with the majority of foods
I eat. This has not helped much, and I will soon be looking into adding a Cox-2 inhibitor such
as Celebrex into my daily regimen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The physical pain I live with every day, which is worsened by almost any movement I make, has
become extremely debilitating. This disabling pain has caused me to become very depressed.
My condition impairs my ability to function normally in society. I am unable to work, and have
come close to dropping out of school more than once. I need to be able to get rid of the pain
I live with every day so that I will be able to function normally once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



This condition continues to be extremely costly for all parties involved. The insurance portion
alone of the payment for the Psychiatrist I have begun seeing as a result of the depression
this pain causes me, is $160 every month. Additional costs include doctor and dermatologist
visits that I have needed as a result of my condition. In addition, I have already gone through
one month of outpatient hospitalization at a substantial cost, because of the depression my
Rosacea has caused me. By eliminating the need for most of these, five to ten treatments with
Photoderm (which would cost a total of $1200-$1950) would be substantially less expensive than
my current course of therapy has been. Payment for these five to ten treatments would be an
extreme hardship for me, as my condition leaves me unable to seek employment. I have also begun
to develop early-stage Rhynophymia as a direct result of my Rosacea, which if left untreated
may eventually require an even more costly medically necessary surgery. Photoderm will prevent
this aspect of my condition from getting worse, eliminating the possible need for more costly
surgery in the future. It is important to remember that Rosacea is a progressive disease. Every
symptom I have mentioned will more than likely continue to become more and more debilitating
in the future without proper treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



My condition and the constant, debilitating pain it causes has left me unable to work. Since
developing this condition I have been unable to maintain a steady job. The pain caused by simply
placing my face against my pillow at night has left me unable to sleep properly. I usually
am finally able to fall asleep around 4 A.M. with the help of powerful prescription sleep aids
such as Ambien. Basically, my condition has left me unable to live a normal life. As you may
or may not know, Photoderm has many different settings associated with it. The shallow filters
are used to remove superficial, cosmetic redness from a person's skin. These are used for many
cosmetic procedures. The deeper filters, which the doctor who would be performing the procedure
has assured me will be used almost exclusively in my treatment, can be used to treat the underlying
vascular reactivity, permanently decreasing my facial swelling, inflammation, and burning.
This is why I require treatment with Photoderm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



I am asking you to please reconsider your decision. I am not having these treatments done for
cosmetic reasons. I am having these treatments done because nothing else has worked. In my
case, this is anything BUT a cosmetic problem. I have submitted supporting documentation from
Dr. xxxxxx (my derm) with my request that you reconsider your original determination. Thank
you for your review.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Netwide Assembler is an x86 and x86-64 assembler that uses syntax similar to Intel. It supports a variety of object file formats, including:

#ELF32/64
#Linux a.out
#NetBSD/FreeBSD a.out
#MS-DOS 16-bit/32-bit object files
#Win32/64 object files
#COFF
#Mach-O 32/64
#rdf
#binary

NASM runs on both Unix/Linux and Windows/DOS.

== NASM Syntax ==

{{Wikipedia|Netwide Assembler}}

The Netwide Assembler (NASM) uses a syntax &quot;designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less complex&quot;. This means that the operand order is '''dest''' then '''src''', as opposed to the AT&amp;T style used by the GNU Assembler. For example,

 mov ax, 9

loads the number 9 into register ax.

For those using gdb with nasm, you can set gdb to use Intel-style disassembly by issuing the command:

 set disassembly-flavor intel

=== Comments ===

A single semi-colon is used for comments, and functions the same as double slash in C++: the compiler ignores from the semicolon to the next newline.

=== Macros ===

NASM has powerful macro functions, similar to C's preprocessor. For example,
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
%define newline 0xA
%define func(a, b) ((a) * (b) + 2)

func (1, 22) ; expands to ((1) * (22) + 2)

%macro print 1 ; macro with one argument
  push dword %1 ; %1 means first argument
  call printf
  add  esp, 4
%endmacro

print mystring ; will call printf
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example I/O (Linux and BSD) ==

To pass the kernel a simple input command on Linux, you would pass values to the following registers and then send the kernel an interrupt signal. To read in a single character from standard input (such as from a user at their keyboard), do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; read a byte from stdin
mov eax, 3		 ; 3 is recognized by the system as meaning &quot;read&quot;
mov ebx, 0		 ; read from standard input
mov ecx, variable        ; address to pass to
mov edx, 1		 ; input length (one byte)
int 0x80                 ; call the kernel
&lt;/source&gt;

After the &lt;code&gt;int 0x80&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; will contain the number of bytes read. If this number is &lt; 0, there was a read error of some sort.

Outputting follows a similar convention:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; print a byte to stdout
mov eax, 4           ; the system interprets 4 as &quot;write&quot;
mov ebx, 1           ; standard output (print to terminal)
mov ecx, variable    ; pointer to the value being passed
mov edx, 1           ; length of output (in bytes)
int 0x80             ; call the kernel
&lt;/source&gt;

BSD systems (MacOS X included) use similar system calls, but convention to execute them is different. While on Linux you pass system call arguments in different registers, on BSD systems they are pushed onto stack (except the system call number, which is put into eax, the same way as in Linux). BSD version of the code above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; read a byte from stdin
mov eax, 3		; sys_read system call
push dword 1		; input length
push dword variable	; address to pass to
push dword 0		; read from standard input
push eax
int 0x80		; call the kernel
add esp, 16		; move back the stack pointer

; write a byte to stdout
mov eax, 4		; sys_write system call
push dword 1		; output length
push dword variable	; memory address
push dword 1		; write to standard output
push eax
int 0x80		; call the kernel
add esp, 16		; move back the stack pointer

; quit the program
mov eax, 1		; sys_exit system call
push dword 0		; program return value
push eax
int 0x80		; call the kernel
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello World (Linux) ==

Below we have a simple Hello world example, it lays out the basic structure of a nasm program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _start

section .data
        ; Align to the nearest 2 byte boundary, must be a power of two
        align 2
        ; String, which is just a collection of bytes, 0xA is newline
        str:     db 'Hello, world!',0xA
        strLen:  equ $-str

section .bss

section .text
        _start:

;
;       op      dst,  src
;
                                ;
                                ; Call write(2) syscall:
                                ;       ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count)
                                ;
        mov     edx, strLen     ; Arg three: the length of the string
        mov     ecx, str        ; Arg two: the address of the string
        mov     ebx, 1          ; Arg one: file descriptor, in this case stdout
        mov     eax, 4          ; Syscall number, in this case the write(2) syscall: 
        int     0x80            ; Interrupt 0x80        

                                ;
                                ; Call exit(3) syscall
                                ;       void exit(int status)
                                ;
        mov     ebx, 0          ; Arg one: the status
        mov     eax, 1          ; Syscall number:
        int     0x80
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -f elf32 -g helloWorld.asm
$ ld -g helloWorld.o
$ ./a.out
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello World (Using only Win32 system calls) ==

In this example we are going to rewrite the hello world example using Win32 system calls. There are several major differences:

#The intermediate file will be a Microsoft Win32 (i386) object file
#We will avoid using interrupts since they may not be portable and therefore we need to bring in several calls from kernel32 DLL


&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _start

extern _GetStdHandle@4
extern _WriteConsoleA@20
extern _ExitProcess@4

section .data
        str:     db 'hello, world',0xA
        strLen:  equ $-str

section .bss
        numCharsWritten:        resb 1

section .text
        _start:

        ;
        ; HANDLE WINAPI GetStdHandle( _In_  DWORD nStdHandle ) ;
        ;
        push    dword -11       ; Arg1: request handle for standard output
        call    _GetStdHandle@4 ; Result: in eax

        ;
        ; BOOL WINAPI WriteConsole(
        ;       _In_        HANDLE hConsoleOutput,
        ;       _In_        const VOID *lpBuffer,
        ;       _In_        DWORD nNumberOfCharsToWrite,
        ;       _Out_       LPDWORD lpNumberOfCharsWritten,
        ;       _Reserved_  LPVOID lpReserved ) ;
        ;
        push    dword 0         ; Arg5: Unused so just use zero
        push    numCharsWritten ; Arg4: push pointer to numCharsWritten
        push    dword strLen    ; Arg3: push length of output string
        push    str             ; Arg2: push pointer to output string
        push    eax             ; Arg1: push handle returned from _GetStdHandle
        call    _WriteConsoleA@20


        ;
        ; VOID WINAPI ExitProcess( _In_  UINT uExitCode ) ;
        ;
        push    dword 0         ; Arg1: push exit code
        call    _ExitProcess@4
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following. This example was run under cygwin, in a Windows command prompt the link step would be different. In this example we use the &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; command line option when invoking &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; to specify the entry point for program execution. Otherwise we would have to use &lt;code&gt;_WinMain@16&lt;/code&gt; as the entry point rather than &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt;. One last note, &lt;code&gt;WriteConsole()&lt;/code&gt; does not behave well within a cygwin console, so in order to see output the final exe should be run within a Windows command prompt:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -f win32 -g helloWorldWin32.asm
$ ld -e _start helloWorldwin32.obj -lkernel32 -o helloWorldWin32.exe
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hello World (Using C libraries and Linking with gcc) ==

In this example we will rewrite Hello World to use &lt;code&gt;printf(3)&lt;/code&gt; from the C library and link using &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;. This has the advantage that going from Linux to Windows requires minimal source code changes and a slightly different assemble and link steps. In the Windows world this has the additional benefit that the linking step will be the same in the Windows command prompt and cygwin. There are several major changes:

#The &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello, world&quot;&lt;/code&gt; string now becomes the format string for &lt;code&gt;printf(3)&lt;/code&gt; and therefore needs to be null terminated. This also means we do not need to explicitly specify it's length anymore.
#gcc expects the entry point for execution to be main
#Microsoft will prefix functions using the &lt;code&gt;cdecl&lt;/code&gt; calling convention with a underscore. So &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; will become &lt;code&gt;_main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_printf&lt;/code&gt; respectively in the Windows development environment.


&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global main

extern printf

section .data
        fmtStr:  db 'hello, world',0xA,0

section .text
        main:

        sub     esp, 4          ; Allocate space on the stack for one 4 byte parameter

        lea     eax, [fmtStr]
        mov     [esp], eax      ; Arg1: pointer to format string
        call    printf         ; Call printf(3):
                                ;       int printf(const char *format, ...);

        add     esp, 4          ; Pop stack once

        ret
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -felf32 helloWorldgcc.asm
$ gcc helloWorldgcc.o -o helloWorldgcc
&lt;/source&gt;

The Windows version with prefixed underscores:
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _main

extern _printf                ; Uncomment under Windows

section .data
        fmtStr:  db 'hello, world',0xA,0

section .text
        _main:

        sub     esp, 4          ; Allocate space on the stack for one 4 byte parameter

        lea     eax, [fmtStr]
        mov     [esp], eax      ; Arg1: pointer to format string
        call    _printf         ; Call printf(3):
                                ;       int printf(const char *format, ...);

        add     esp, 4          ; Pop stack once

        ret

&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assemble, link and run the program we need to do the following.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ nasm -fwin32 helloWorldgcc.asm
$ gcc helloWorldgcc.o -o helloWorldgcc.exe
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prior to beginning any new rosacea treatment, one needs to prepare the skin, and allow the skin to heal from the effects of previous treatments, which may have left the skin damaged or overly sensitive. We often hear people tell us that the rosacea treatments they had been using left their skin so sensitive that “even water hurts their skin” which can be very true. If one then uses a harsh acidic or invading rosacea treatment such as laser, skin rejuvenation or anti-wrinkle treatment, or retinoids, then obviously the rosacea sufferer is going further down the wrong rosacea treatment pathway.

So many times rosacea or the worsening of rosacea from a mild stage to a more severe stage is the result of treatments that we have used in the past or are currently using. Use of acne treatments containing ingredients such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide cause increased redness to the facial skin; often we overuse these products because we feel they are not working. For instance you have more pimples so you use more of the acne treatment. When you do this, the skin reacts by trying to form a barrier of more oil to protect itself from the harmful effects of the offending treatment. So you tend to use more to counteract this effect and in doing so the pores tighten and close resulting in clogged pores, pimples and papules.

While coping with Rosacea, a way to successful skin care is to avoid doing anything to irritate your skin which may cause a flare up and worsen the condition. Anything that makes your skin (more)red is just worsening the problem. 
When selecting a skin care regimen, it is important to avoid ingredients that may irritate the skin. Alcohol, alpha-hydroxys, glycolic acid, should generally be avoided. Additionally, exfoliation should be avoided, particularly in affected areas. 
The key to managing skin with Rosacea is recognizing that the skin is suffering an inflammatory response.

Rosacea is very often associated with sun exposure, so protection of the skin with sunscreens is important.

==Cleansing==
Experts agree that a gentle cleansing regime is very important. Avoiding chemicals that aggravate the rosacea, but will clean and moisturise the skin is a step in the right direction. Routine everyday care of skin is an essential part of optimal patient management. Common problems such as xerosis, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, acne, rosacea, and photodamage leave the skin vulnerable to external insults, partly as a result of varying levels of barrier dysfunction. Cosmetic surgery procedures also typically damage the stratum corneum (SC) and leave skin with a very weak barrier during recovery phase. Cleansing is an important aspect of any skin care, since it not only removes unwanted dirt, soil, and bacteria from skin, but also removes dead surface cells, preparing skin to better absorb topically applied drugs/medication. Care must be taken to minimize any further weakening of the SC barrier during cleansing. Cleansers based on mild synthetic surfactants and/or emollients that cause minimal barrier perturbation are ideal for these patients.

Absolutely no way should harsh cleansers and toners be used. The natural oils on the skin must be regulated to allow the skin to form it’s own defenses against any harmful bacteria or environmental distress.
Stick with mild cleansers targeted at sensitive skin. Cetaphil is one of the mildest cleansers out there and an ideal choice for delicate, irritable skin. Avoid cleansers that are heavily perfumed or contain detergents, alcohol, or other known irritants. Just because a cleanser says it provides &quot;mild cleansing&quot; doesn't mean it will be kind to rosacea skin. When looking for a cleanser, look for &quot;Sensitive Skin Tested&quot; on the label. The bottom line: If it stings, don't use it. It's as simple as that. Return it, throw it out, or give it away and start again.

After using the cleaner, the face will be rinsed with plentifulness of water and smudge with a soft towel in order not to irritate your skin. Because the skin touched of rosacea is very dry, you should avoid using coppices or rough towels to rub your face skin. When washing your face you should utilise lukewarm water instead of hot water.

==Basic Skin Care==
Never rub the skin. This can be difficult rule to follow, particularly when applying makeup, shave, or dry the skin after cleansing, but it is important. All these activities should be done in a way that does not move the skin. Use a very light touch at all times. An alternative to using a cleanser is to use a warm water rinse. Let your skin air dry as much as possible, and if needed blot very lightly with a soft towel. 

Use a moisturizer free of fragrance, dyes, and other known irritants. As with washing and  drying, do not rub the product into your skin. Rub the product between your hands before applying very gently and use more product than may seem needed, as this will prevent friction, If you find it easier, simply blot the moisturizer onto your skin after you have rubbed it onto your hands. Any extra product can be removed by placing a tissue over your face and neck and blotting it off. Lay it flat and lightly press and peel off. This method should be used by those who wear a foundation to cover redness. Also of course, pay attention to ingredients in your makeup as well. 

==Sunscreen==
An unexpected day out at the beach or a sport game in the back yard in the searing heat will leave a rosacea sufferer red all over. The heat from the sunlight can cause flushing and the sunburn cause extra redness. Even when not out in the sun wearing a sunscreen is reccommended.

UV light is of a shorter wavelenght than visible light and is subdivided into three bands UVA, UVB and UVC. UVA light penetrates deeply and contributes to ageing, UVB causes burning and redness. Very little UVC light makes it past the atmosphere.

The SPF (sun protection factor) of a sunscreen is a laboratory measure of its effectiveness against UVB light that causes sunburn. SPF 15 means that a user can nominally remain in the sun 15 times longer than would otherwise cause them to have sunburn, but this varies with a number of factors. The SPF is not a linear measure of the amount of Ultraviolet blocked. A sunscreen rated 15 blocks 93.3% of UV, and an SPF 30 sunscreen blocks 96.7%. The SPF does not measure a sunscreens effectiveness agaings UVA light.

Sunlight was identified as the most common trigger by a survey by the national rosacea society. In many studies it has been found beneficial for rosacea patients to use sunscreen everyday to reduce their symptoms. Sunscreen is also highily reccommended for patients taking treatments that cause photo sensitivity such as various antibiotics and isotretoin.

Find a broad sprectrum sunscreen preferably with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the main active ingredient that is also noncomedogenic and nonirritating skin. zinc oxide and titanium dioxide both block UV light instead of absorb then like most sunscreens. They also work immediately after application while other sunscreens need to be applied 30 minutes beforehand.

It is important to have sun protection while in the sun, but it is also important to use a sunscreen that will not cause irritation. Select a sunscreen target towarde those for rosacea or sunscreens that have good reviews by rosaceans.

==Shaving==
Shaving will always cause some irritation but it can be minimised.

Get a good rotary head electric razor, a wet/dry one if possible so you can use it in the shower.
You can use a shaving lotion to allow the shaver to glide easily over your face. Recommended lotions are jojoba oil, an aloe-based shaving cream or Edge Gel for Sensitive skin. Don't use anything with alcohol in it.
You can shave before bed time, in the shower or after having a shower.
Shave with light, short strokes in the direction of hair growth. Shaving with the grain helps prevent ingrown hairs, razor burn, and cuts. Instead of shaving against the grain to get a close shave, shave twice.
If you use a blade, make sure that your face is coated with a thin stream of hot water before applying shaving cream. Give the cream a few minutes to settle in. Use a sharp razor that has a double blade attached to it. Take your time and rinse with cold water, not hot. Allowing the steam of a shower or hot towel to soften the follicles of a tough beard can be a better preparation.

Do not forget to shave gently and shaving too frequent shaving will irritate skin.

==Concealers and makeup==
Both men and women can benefit from the vast range of rosacea friendly makeup products. Give yourself the edge by testing the impact that correctly applied makeup can have. We hope that in reading this, you're armed with the information you need to make this a success. 

Make yourself familiar with ingredients which may aggravate or irritate rosacea skin. Some find that they are only able to use mineral makeup. Ingredients to various brands of mineral makeup can be found at the Mineral Powder Foundation Ingredients List website (http://people.delphiforums.com/tracikenyon/IngredList22405.html).         
Many of the main stream commercial brands may include ingredients that may irritate. Sometimes the only way to know is to try so it's a good idea to do a bit of research in regards to ingredients. Lots of great brand name foundations out there though. No one product will work for everyone!
If you wanted a more sheer look, find a liquid foundation that matches your skin tone and doesn't irritate and mix a few drops into your daily moisturiser. It will give sheer coverage, natural and it may be all you need. Lighter, oil free foundations are better for those with oily skin, and more emollient products are better for dry skin.

Always go for a foundation with a yellow base. Some opt for a green makeup base or primer. Some use concealers with a green tint. For the most part, this is just an added step, with more products now on your skin. Most people find that once they find the appropriate foundation, using green based products isn't necessary.

===Application===
Open your mouth when applying foundation to expose the neck area and eliminate an obvious line at the jaw line. When testing, apply a sample to the jawline and then go outside with a small mirror. If you can't see where the foundation is, then you've got the right colour. 

Buy 2 different shades of the same foundation, one lighter and one darker, so that as the seasons change you can mix the colours to accommodate any changes in your natural skin colour. Some find that this is not necessary.

As far as application, always apply your makeup in natural daylight. And for novices, spend time at how perfecting application. 
Always start with less as it is easier to add more as you go along if needed. Put a little foundation on the hand (add a complimentary tone if necessary). Dot it over the face-on the nose, the cheeks, the chin and the temples and in between the brows. Using the tips of two fingers or a small clean, dampened sponge(from which excess water has been removed) blend the foundation. Always work from the face outwards, to avoid an accumulation of the foundation around the hairline-move from the cheeks to the ears, from between the brows down over the nose, from the chin out towards the jaw, then onto the neck. Work quickly, carefully and lightly. Blend well around the hairline, on the neck, below the eyes and behind the ears. Also take the foundation over the eyelids. Finally blot the face with a clean dry tissue, pressing it lightly over the skin. Apply a little powder to set the foundation if necessary. Go lightly the first time and go back to focus on certain areas the second time. Try to make everything look better, not look perfect. Whatever isn't covered by your first application/subsequent spot treating (very light spot treating) you might want to just leave alone. It has to match exactly. Even if you get &quot;Wow, this is nearly invisible&quot;, try to see if you can get to the point where you say &quot;Wow, this is invisible.&quot; It's absolutely critical it matches. If you try something and for whatever reason this brand doesn't offer you a good enough match, don't buy it just because. Try a different brand, first. When testing, apply a sample to the jawline and then go outside with a small mirror. If you can't see where the foundation is, then you've got the right colour. But, don't judge your match in blinding sunlight, this light will &quot;blend&quot; almost anything seamlessly and will not be accurate.

===Extra bit For Men===
Although the above information applies to everyone, I figured I'd touch on this subject further.
Don't gravitate to products that say &quot;For Men&quot; on them. The color selections are almost always horrible and they are either too expensive or lacking in formulation. Or both. In short: The men who want to buy this stuff have already bought it and don't care if something is designated &quot;For Men.&quot; The difference is in the packaging.
&quot;For Men&quot; is for the men with fragile egos. Stick with bigger brands, they have more color selection, better formulations, you name it. MAC, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Armani, Becca, etc. 
You can do some browsing online for products you might want to try but just jot down the names of the products, don't bother remembering the name of the color. They're usually far off base in person. If going to a counter makes you uncomfortable, you might want to go in the morning when there are less people. Remember: You're not the only guy they've done this for!
Sometimes sales associates will try to sell you things you don't need, so in case you didn't already know: you don't need primer, you don't need seperate cleansers, etc. While you're learning, sponges and brushes are not necessary. Tell them you'll stick to using your fingers for now. (Unless of course you want to buy them.) Ask them for samples! Even if they have to put them in a little jar or something. Most if not all counters/stores do this. Keep in mind you will need a cleanser that is able to remove makeup. Lastly, if you're going to worry all the time that you have makeup on, always running to the mirror, being self conscious, etc, it defeats the purpose of wearing it. Don't feel forced into this. This should be something to help you feel better about yourself. Not worse.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In '''Windows''' (and most modern operating systems), there is a distinction between code that is running in &quot;user mode&quot;, and code that is running in &quot;kernel mode&quot;. This chapter is going to point out some of the differences. Firstly, Intel CPUs have modes of operation called ''rings'' which specify the type of instructions and memory available to the running code. There are four rings:

* ''Ring 0'' (also known as ''kernel mode'') has full access to every resource. It is the mode in which the Windows kernel runs.
* Rings 1 and 2 can be customized with levels of access but are generally unused unless there are virtual machines running.
* ''Ring 3'' (also known as ''user mode'') has restricted access to resources.

The reason for this is because if all programs ran in kernel mode, they would be able to overwrite each others' memory and possibly bring down the entire system when they crashed.

== Virtual Memory ==
[[File:VirtualMem01.png|thumb|The program thinks it has a large range of contiguous addresses; but in reality the parts it is currently using are scattered around RAM, and the inactive parts are saved in a disk file.]]

When a program is started (e.g. a web browser or a word processor), it runs in its own ''process''. A process contains its own &quot;virtual&quot; memory space and resources. Its memory is &quot;virtual&quot; because the process thinks memory that is at address &lt;code&gt;0x12345678&lt;/code&gt; may actually be at address &lt;code&gt;0x65f7a678&lt;/code&gt; in physical memory. Similarly, two different processes may have different data stored at (to them) &lt;code&gt;0x00401000&lt;/code&gt;. This is implemented by dividing memory into chunks called ''pages''; on x86 systems one page is 4 kilobytes in size. Each page can have its own set of attributes, such as read-only/read-write. The CPU has a transparent mechanism for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses through a ''page table'' which the operating system sets up.

Virtual memory is useful for many reasons:

# The process cannot access other process' memory,
# Each page can have different protection settings (read-only or read-write, kernel-mode-only), and
# Inactive memory regions of the process can be &quot;paged out&quot; (stored) to the ''pagefile'' and be retrieved by the operating system when needed. This is also done when the system is low on physical memory.

== User Mode ==
Every process started by Windows (with the exception of the ''System'' &quot;process&quot;) runs in user mode. In this mode, programs cannot modify paging directly and so have no way of accessing other programs' memory except through API functions. Programs in user mode also cannot interfere with interrupts and context switching.

== Kernel Mode, Interrupts, and System Calls ==
When Windows is first loaded, the Windows kernel is started. It runs in kernel mode and sets up paging and virtual memory. It then creates some system processes and allows them to run in user mode. How does the CPU ever switch back to kernel mode then? This is not done automatically by the CPU. The CPU is often interrupted by certain events (timers, keyboard, hard disk I/O), and these are called ''interrupts''. The kernel must first set up ''interrupt handlers'' to deal with these events. Then, whenever interrupts occur, the CPU stops executing the currently running program, immediately switches to kernel mode, and executes the interrupt handler for that event. The handler saves the state of the CPU, performs some processing relevant to that event, and restores the state of the CPU (possibly switching back to user mode) so the CPU can resume execution of the program.

When a program wants to call a Windows API function&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, it triggers an interrupt&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which causes the CPU to switch to kernel mode and begin executing the desired API function. When the API function has finished processing, it switches back to user mode and resumes execution of the program. This is because API functions like &lt;code&gt;ReadProcessMemory&lt;/code&gt; cannot work in user mode; the program can't access other programs' memory. In kernel mode, however, the API function can read any memory region without restriction.

&lt;small&gt;1. Actually, Windows API functions eventually call a different API: the ''Native API''. This is the API used by the Windows NT family of kernels. ''This'' is when the CPU switches to kernel-mode.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;2. Modern CPUs have special, faster instructions for system calls, such as &lt;code&gt;sysenter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sysexit&lt;/code&gt; on x86. These instructions cause the CPU to switch to ring 0, and then begin executing a handler set up by the operating system.&lt;/small&gt;

== Context Switching ==
So, a program runs and calls API functions. How do other programs get a chance to run, then? Most of the time, programs simply allow the operating system to switch to another program because they are waiting for something (human input, hard disk). These programs are known as ''unrunnable'' programs, and since they make calls to the kernel to wait for something, the kernel knows to perform ''context switching'' to allow another program to run. This is done by:

# Saving the current program's state (including registers),
# Figuring out which program to run next,
# and restoring a different program's state.

If a program (''thread'' or ''process'' to be more accurate) runs for more than a certain period of time (the ''thread quantum'' or a processes ''time slice''), the operating system will context switch to another program. This idea is called ''preemption''. Preemption is accomplished by setting a timed interrupt in the processor that will invoke context switching.  The time slice that is used may be different for each process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== C and Windows ==

Many of the low-level functions in Windows were created using the C programming language. C code tends to be relatively small and fast compared to VB code or even C++ code, and has a shorter development time compared to raw assembly code. All of the DLLs in the Win32 API, and most of the kernel-level structures are implemented in C code.

== Visual Basic and Windows ==

Visual Basic is essentially a &quot;Windows-only&quot; programming language - although some ports either exist or are in development for other systems, VB is not nearly as popular on other operating systems as it is on Windows. The VB runtime libraries tap into the Win32 API and the MFC libraries, to implement its functionality. The new version of VB, &quot;VB.NET&quot;, uses the .NET platform, and therefore will not be covered in this wikibook. Old versions of VB, or &quot;VB Classic&quot; utilize the same Win32 API and MFC interfaces that C and C++ use to communicate with Windows. However, not all of the functions are identical, because VB uses different data types, and stores data differently than C or C++. As we discuss the Win32 API and MFC, we will attempt to show how the same functionality is implemented in VB.

Visual Basic uses the STDCALL calling convention for implementing function calls. Most of the Win32 API uses the STDCALL calling convention as well, so much of the hard work for interfacing the two is done by the compiler. C and C++, on the other hand, do not use STDCALL by default, and if you want to manually link a VB object code file     with a C object file, you will need to explicitly make the C interface a STDCALL one.

== COM and Windows ==

Microsoft implemented a technology known as the '''Component Object Model''' for Windows. COM essentially takes the object-oriented programming paradigm to the next level, by standardizing the class interface, and allowing classes to be written in different languages (C++, VB, etc.) and interfaced together seamlessly. COM programs (or &quot;COM clients&quot;) can be written in most languages that allow object-orientation. More specifically, the only language requirement for COM is that code is generated in a language that can create structures of pointers and, either explicitly or implicitly, call functions through pointers.

== Other Languages ==

Many other programming languages have been implemented on Windows systems, and many of them have some sort of method for interfacing the Win32 API, or the MFC libraries. These interfaces are known collectively as ''wrappers'', because they wrap the functionality of the Win32 API in another programming language. Common wrappers are provided for Perl, Ada, Python, PHP, AutoIT, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== windows.h ==

The primary C header file for accessing the Win32 API is the &lt;code&gt;&lt;windows.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header file. To make a Win32 executable, the first step is to include this header file in your source code. The windows.h header file should be included ''before'' any other library include, even the C standard library files such as stdio.h or stdlib.h. This is because the windows.h file includes macros and other components that may modify, extend, or replace things in these libraries. This is especially true when dealing with UNICODE, because windows.h will cause all the string functions to use UNICODE instead. Also, because many of the standard C library functions are already included in the Windows kernel, many of these functions will be available to the programmer without needing to load the standard libraries. For example, the function &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; is included in windows.h automatically.

== Child Header Files ==

There are a number of header files that are automatically included with windows.h. Many of these files cannot simply be included by themselves, because of dependencies. The windows.h header file is actually a relatively small file, that provides conditional inclusion for a number of other header files, definitions of a few important macros, etc.

----- For a list of child header file visit----------
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows.h

== Additional Header Files ==

This section will talk about some other interesting header files and libraries that can be included with your project, but which are not included by default with windows.h.

== windows.h Macros ==

This section will briefly detail some of the changes that the user can make in the windows.h structure at compile time using macros.

=== WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN ===

The WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN macro causes several of the child headers to not be included in the build. This can help to speed up the compilation process.

=== UNICODE and _UNICODE ===

These macros, which we will discuss later, can generally be used interchangeably, but are frequently both defined together. These cause the program to be compiled with UTF-16 encoded strings instead of ASCII encoded strings. UTF-16 is one internationalized encoding based on the UNICODE standard and allows for more characters than the American ASCII encoding, although UTF-8 is often preferred in modern programming.

=== WINVER and _WIN32_WINNT ===

You must set these to a number greater or equal to 0x500 or you will not get some of the useful functions that are in Windows 2000 (and thus in any modern Windows) but were not in Windows 98.

== Introduction to Unicode ==
{{wikipedia|Unicode}}
'''Unicode''' is an industry standard whose goal is to provide the means by which text of all forms and languages can be encoded for use by computers.
Originally, text-characters were represented in computers using byte-wide data: each printable character (and many non-printing, or &quot;control&quot; characters) were implemented using a single byte each, which allowed for 256 characters total. However, globalization has created a need for computers to be able to accommodate many different alphabets from around the world. 

The old codes were known as ASCII or EBCDIC, but it was apparent that neither of these codes were capable of handling all the different characters and alphabets from around the world. The solution to this problem created Unicode. Windows NT implements many of its core functions with a &quot;wide&quot; 16-bit characters set, close to Unicode standard, although it provides a series of functions that are compatible with the standard ASCII characters as well.

UNICODE characters are frequently called &quot;Wide Characters&quot;, &quot;Generic Characters&quot;, or &quot;T Characters&quot;. This book may use any of these terms interchangeably.

=== Variable-Width Characters ===

Before Unicode, there was an internationalization attempt that introduced character strings with variable-width characters. Some characters, such as the standard ASCII characters would be 1 byte long. Other characters, such as extended character sets, were two bytes long. These types of character formats fell out of favor with the advent of UNICODE because they are harder to write and much harder to read. Windows does still maintain some functionality to deal with variable-width strings, but we won't discuss those here.

Unfortunately all advantages of using wide characters were lost because the number of characters needed quickly exceeded the 65,536 possible 16-bit values. Windows actually uses what is called UTF-16 to store characters, where a large number of characters actually take //two// words, these are called &quot;surrogate pairs&quot;. This development is after much of the Windows API documentation was written and much of it is now obsolete. You should never treat string data as an &quot;array of characters&quot;, instead always treat it as a null-terminated block. For instance always send the entire string to a function to draw it on the screen, do not attempt to draw each character. Any code that puts a square bracket after a LPSTR is wrong.

At the same time, variable-width character-based strings made a big comeback in the multi-platform standard called UTF-8, which is pretty much the same idea as UTF-16 except with 8-bit units. Its primary advantage is that there is no need for two APIs. The 'A' and 'W' APIs would have been the same if this were used, and since both are variable-sized, it has no disadvantage. Although most Windows programmers are unfamiliar with it, you may see increased references to using the non-UNICODE API.

== Windows Implementation ==

The Win32 API classifies all of its functions that require text input into two categories. Some of the functions have an &quot;A&quot; suffix (for ASCII), and some have a &quot;W&quot; suffix (for Wide characters, or Unicode). These functions are differentiated using the macro &quot;UNICODE&quot;:

 #ifdef UNICODE
 #define MessageBox MessageBoxW
 #else
 #define MessageBox MessageBoxA
 #endif

Because of this differentiation, when you receive a compiler error, you will get an error on &quot;MessageBoxW&quot; instead of simply &quot;MessageBox&quot;. In these cases, the compiler is not broken. It is simply trying to follow a complex set of macros.

== Unicode Environment ==

All Windows functions that require character strings are defined in this manner. If you want to use unicode in your program, you need to explicitly define the UNICODE macro before you include the windows.h file:

 #define UNICODE
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

Also, some functions in other libraries require you to define the macro _UNICODE. The standard library functions can be provided in unicode by including the &lt;tchar.h&gt; file as well. So, to use unicode in your project, you need to make the following declarations in your project:

 #define UNICODE
 #define _UNICODE
 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
 #include &lt;tchar.h&gt;

Some header files include a mechanism like the following, so that when one of the two UNICODE macros is defined, the other is automatically defined as well:

 #ifdef UNICODE
   #ifndef _UNICODE
     #define _UNICODE
   #endif
 #endif

 #ifdef _UNICODE
   #ifndef UNICODE
     #define UNICODE
   #endif
 #endif

If you are writing a library that utilizes UNICODE, it might be worthwhile for you to include this mechanism in your header files as well, so that other programmers don't need to worry about including both macros.

== TEXT macro ==

In C, to make a string of wide characters, you need to prefix the string with the letter &quot;L&quot;. Here is an example:

 char *asciimessage = &quot;This is an ASCII string.&quot;;
 wchar_t *unicodemessage = L&quot;This is a Wide Unicode string.&quot;;

The data type &quot;TCHAR&quot; is defined as being a char type if unicode is not defined, and is defined as being a wide type if UNICODE is defined (in tchar.h). To make strings portable between unicode and non-unicode, we can use the TEXT() macro to automatically define a string as being unicode or not:

 TCHAR *automessage = TEXT(&quot;This message can be either ASCII or UNICODE!&quot;);

Using TCHAR data types, and the TEXT macro are important steps in making your code portable between different environments.

Also, the TEXT macro can be written as:

 TEXT(&quot;This is a generic string&quot;);
 _T(&quot;This is also a generic string&quot;);
 T(&quot;This is also a generic string&quot;);

All three of these statements are equivalent.

The TEXT macro is typically defined like this:

 #ifdef UNICODE
 #define TEXT(t) L##t
 #define _T(t) L##t
 #define T(t) L##t
 #else
 #define TEXT(t) t
 #define _T(t) t
 #define T(t) t
 #endif

=== Control Characters ===
Unicode characters 0 to 31 (U+0000 to U+001F) are part of the C0 Controls and Basic Latin block. They are all control characters. These characters correspond to the first 32 characters of the ASCII set.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== WinMain ==

Programming Windows in C can be a little bit different from what most people are used to. First off, there isn't a '''main()''' function, but instead there is a '''_tWinMain()''' function to start your program off. _tWinMain() is defined as a macro in tchar.h as such:

 #ifdef _UNICODE
 #define _tWinMain wWinMain
 #else 
 #define _tWinMain WinMain
 #endif

This means that Windows functions can be written easily in Unicode or ASCII. Besides the difference in function name, _tWinMain also has different parameters than the standard main function:

 int WinMain(HINSTANCE hThisInstance, 
               HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, 
               LPSTR lpszArgument,  // LPWSTR for wWinMain
               int iCmdShow);

HINSTANCE objects are references to a program instance. hThisInstance is a reference to the current program, and hPrevInstance is a reference to any previously running versions of this same program. However, in Windows NT, the hPrevInstance data object is always NULL. This means that we can't use the hPrevInstance value to determine if there are other copies of the same program running on your system. There are different ways of checking for other copies of a program running, and we will discuss those methods later.

lpszArgument essentially contains all the information that the argc and argv variables used to show, except that the command-line arguments are not broken up into a vector. This means that if you want to sort individual arguments from the command line, you need to either break them up yourself, or call one of the available functions to break it up for you. We will discuss these functions later.

The last argument, &quot;int iCmdShow&quot; is a data item of type int (integer) that determines whether or not a graphical window should be displayed immediately, or if the program should run minimized.

WinMain has a number of different jobs:

#Register the window classes to be used by the program
#Create any Windows used by the program
#Run the message loop

We will explain each of those tasks in more detail.

=== Register Window Classes ===

Every little graphical detail you see on the screen is known as a &quot;window&quot;. Each program with a box around it, each button, each text box are all called windows. In fact, all of these various objects all get created in the same manner. This must mean that there are a large number of options and customizations available in order to get things as different as textboxes and scroll bars from the same method. Each window has an associated &quot;Window Class&quot; that needs to be registered with the system, to specify the different properties of the window. This is done by following 2 steps:

#Fill in the fields of the WNDCLASS data object
#Pass the WNDCLASS object to the RegisterClass function.

Also, there is an &quot;extended&quot; version of this procedure, that can be followed with similar results:

#Fill in the fields of the WNDCLASSEX object
#Pass the WNDCLASSEX object to the RegisterClassEx function.

Either of these methods can be used to register the class, but the -Ex version has a few more options.

Once the class is registered, you can discard the WNDCLASS structure, because you don't need it anymore.

== Create Windows ==

Creating Windows can be done with the CreateWindow or the CreateWindowEx functions. Both perform the same general task, but again, the -Ex version has more options. You pass some specifics to the CreateWindow function, such as the window size, the window location (the X and Y coordinates), the window title, etc. CreateWindow will return a HWND data object, that is a handle to the newly created window. Next, most programs will pass this handle to the '''ShowWindow''' function, to make the window appear on the screen.
The way CreateWindow() creates a window is as follows:
  
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;hwnd=CreateWindowEx(
     WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,
     g_szClassName,
     &quot;The title of my window&quot;,
     WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
     CW_USERDEFAULT,CW_USERDAFAULT,240,120,
     NULL,NULL,hTnstance,NULL);&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first parameter WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE is the extended window style. Next we have the class name g_szClassName, this tells the system what kind of window to create. Since we want to create a window from the class we just registered, we use the name of that class. After that we specify our window name or title which is the text that will be displayed in the caption, or title bar on our window. The parameter we have as WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW is the Window Style parameter. There are quite a few of these and you should look them up and experiment to find out what they do.
The next four parameters (CW_USERDEFAULT,CW_USERDAFAULT,240,120) are the X and Y co-ordinates for the top left corner of your window, and the width and height of the window. The X and Y co-ordinates are se to CW_USERDAFAULT to let the window choose where on the screen to put the window.
Next, (NULL,NULL,hTnstance,NULL) we have the parent window handle , the menu handle, the application instance handle, and a pointer handle to window creation data. In windows, the window on the screen is arranged in a hierarchy of the parent and child windows. When one sees a button on a window, the button is the Child and it is contained within the window that is it's Parent. In this example, the parent handle is NULL because we have no parent, this is our main or top level window. The menu is NULL for now since we don't have one yet. The instance handle is set to the value that is passed in as the first parameter of the WinMain(). The creation data that can be used to send additional data to the window that is being created is NULL.

== Message Loop ==

Once the window is created, the window will interact with the rest of the system by way of '''messages'''. The system sends messages to the window, and the window sends messages back. Most programs in fact don't do anything but read messages and respond to them! 

Messages come in the form of an MSG data type. This data object is passed to the GetMessage() function, which reads a message from the message queue, or waits for a new message from the system. Next, the message is sent to the TranslateMessage function, which takes care of some simple tasks such as translating to Unicode or not. Finally, the message is sent to the window for processing using the DispatchMessage function.

Here is an example:

 MSG msg;
 BOOL bRet;
 while( (bRet = GetMessage( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0 )) != 0)
 { 
    if (bRet == -1)
    {
        // handle the error and possibly exit
    }
    else
    {
        TranslateMessage(&amp;msg); 
        DispatchMessage(&amp;msg); 
    }
 }
 
 return msg.wParam;

That last line will be explained later.

== The Window Procedure ==

A window procedure may be named anything you want, but the general prototype for one is as follows:

 LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc (HWND hwnd, 
                           UINT msg, 
                           WPARAM wParam, 
                           LPARAM lParam);

An LRESULT data type is a generic 32-bit data object, that can be type-casted to contain any 32-bit value (including a pointer). The hwnd parameter is a handle to the window itself. The msg data value contains the current message from the operating system, and the WPARAM and LPARAM values contain the arguments for that message. For instance, if a button is pressed on the keyboard, the msg field will contain the message WM_KEYDOWN, and the WPARAM field will contain the actual letter pressed ('A' for instance), and the LPARAM field will contain information on whether or not the CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT buttons are down, and whether the type-matic repeat function has been triggered. Several macros have been defined that are very useful in separating out the WPARAM and LPARAM into different sized chunks:

;LOWORD(x): returns the low 16-bits of the 32-bit argument
;HIWORD(x): returns the high 16-bits of the 32-bit argument
;LOBYTE(x): returns the low 8-bits of the 16-bit argument
;HIBYTE(x): returns the high 8-bits of the 16-bit argument

For instance, to access the 2nd byte in the wParam field, we will use the macros as follows:

 HIBYTE(LOWORD(wParam));

Since the window procedure only has two available parameters, these parameters are often packed with data. These macros are very useful in separating that information out into different fields.

Here is an example of a general Window Procedure, that we will explain:

 LRESULT CALLBACK MyWinProc (HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
 {
    switch (msg)       
    {
        case WM_DESTROY:
            PostQuitMessage(0);
            break;
        default:           
            return DefWindowProc (hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);
    }
    return 0;
 }

Most window procedures only contain a simple loop that searches for particular messages from the system, and then acts on them. In this example, we are only looking for the WM_DESTROY message, which is the message that the kernel sends to the window when the window needs to close. In response to the WM_DESTROY message, the window calls the PostQuitMessage function, which puts a WM_QUIT message (which is defined as 0) into the message queue. When the message loop (described above) gets the WM_QUIT message, it breaks from the loop, and returns the value from the PostQuitMessage function.

Any message that is not handled by the loop should be (must be) passed to the DefWindowProc function. DefWindowProc will perform some default actions based on the messages received, but it won't do anything interesting. If you want your program to do something, you will need to handle these messages yourself. 

== Messages ==

There are a few other messages that we will talk about later on:

;WM_CREATE: Your window receives this message only once, when it is first created. Use this message to perform tasks that need to be handled in the beginning, such as initializing variables, allocating memory, or creating child windows (buttons and textboxes).
;WM_PAINT: This message indicates that it is time for the program to redraw itself. Use the graphical functions to redraw whatever is supposed to be on the window. If you don't draw anything, then the window will either be a boring white (or grey) background, or if the background was not erased, will keep whatever image is already shown on it (which looks unstable.)
;WM_COMMAND: This is a general message that indicates that the user has done something on your window. Either the user has clicked a button, or the user has selected a menu item, or the user has pressed a special &quot;Accelerator&quot; key sequence. The WPARAM and LPARAM fields will contain some descriptions on what happened, so you can find a way to react to this. If you do not process the WM_COMMAND messages, the user will not be able to click any buttons, or select any menu items, and that will be very frustrating indeed.
;WM_CLOSE: The user has decided to close the window, so the kernel sends the WM_CLOSE message. This is the final chance to preserve the window as necessary - if you don't want it closed completely, you should handle the WM_CLOSE message and ensure that it does not destroy the window.  If the WM_CLOSE message is passed to the DefWindowProc, then the window will next receive the WM_DESTROY message. 
;WM_DESTROY: The WM_DESTROY indicates that a given window is removed from the screen and will be unloaded from memory. Normally, your program can post the WM_QUIT message to exit the program by calling PostQuitMessage(). 

These are some of the most basic messages, and we will discuss other messages as the need arises.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''So you want to be a substitute teacher - or plan a lesson for a sub?  Here are some secrets for success.'''


== For the substitute ==

'''Follow the lesson plan.'''
A substitute teacher needs self-confidence.  You do matter and what you do during your time with students counts.  A conscientious teacher will leave you well-prepared plans accounting for every minute of each class period.  If this is the case, do not change the plan - especially when pressured by students who inevitably have a better idea, or a reason why they can't possibly complete the teacher's lesson.  Be firm, don't hesitate and don't accept whining or cajoling. Just do what you've been asked to do. Bear in mind that most often the classroom teacher has put time and effort into the substitute's plan and will depend on you to get the students to do the work. 

'''Get an early lead!'''
The sooner you can get the students seated and working, the easier and more effective your job will be. Take the time before the day's classes begin to read the plans carefully.  Be certain that you understand your charge and that you have all materials organized and ready for the entire day. 

'''Silence sometimes works best.'''
You are now organized and ready for your day. Consider handing students the assignment as they walk in the door, saying very quietly to each that he or she may take a seat and get started as you point to the assignment written on the board.  It would be helpful to write on the board the number of minutes the students will be given to complete the work.  Getting control of a class from the first minute will help to minimize outbursts, wisecracks, and other attempts at insurrection.

'''&quot;But we already did this!&quot;'''
Students work really hard to convince substitutes that the work left was an error on the part of the teacher.  They have, &quot;in fact&quot;, already completed this assignment.  Remember that the teacher is depending on you to have the students complete this assignment. Ask them to redo the work or pass it in.  Don't argue or challenge the students.  Simply say OK and remind them that the work will be graded based upon what is submitted at the end of the class.  If they have already done the work, they may go on to the next assignment or read or study silently. Remind them that you will ask for the assignment at the end of the class. Students that have already completed the work will pass in a note to the teacher saying they have already submitted said work.  These notes will be signed by the student and left for the teacher.  You'll be surprised that most students will complete the work.

'''Don't make deals!'''
You are the teacher.  You don't have to make deals. Don't negotiate an early dismissal or a shortened assignment. Don't feel like you have to schmooze the students into working.  Be cordial, soft-spoken, direct, and firm.  Never be confrontational or sarcastic. Teachers can tease their students because they have developed a trusting rapport.  But the students don't know you well enough for you to treat them casually. What's more, they will often take advantage of an opening to use sarcasm and humor to disrupt the entire class. Be proper and sincere, demonstrating your earnest desire to complete the work as outlined by the classroom teacher.

'''Don't be afraid to ask for help. ''' 
There are teachers all around you who can lend a hand.  Don't hesitate to ask for intervention if you have questions or need assistance.  You will earn more respect by asking for help than you will if you lose control of the class. 


=== Substituting in inner-city schools ===  
Subbing in an inner-city American secondary school can be an entirely rewarding experience or an unforgettable nightmare.  Your boundaries are going to be tested.  There are vast differences regarding student expectations in American schools.  Try to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the school when you enter.  Ask yourself some of these questions: Are the classes with the regular teachers loud and chaotic?
Are large numbers of students roaming the hallway?
Are students wearing hats in school?  
Do students mill around after the bell in the hallway?  
Do teachers shut their doors during classtime?

If the answer to these questions is yes, it is likely you are in a failing school.  Expectations of a substitute vary in each school.  If students are tossing a football around the hallway DURING class (I have been in schools where this has happened) or in front of an administrators office, the chances of you having a productive class are quite slim (although not entirely impossible). Unfortunately, in some schools it is expected that a substitute serves as a &quot;certified&quot; babysitter.  Most likely, if a school has a chaotic atmosphere, it is likely that administrators view a substitute as a babysitter.  In these failing schools, it is also likely the regular faculty and staff are regarded in the same manner.  It is unfortunate that a large number of inner-city schools in America operate in this dysfunctional manner.  Below are some do's and don'ts when subbing in a tough inner-city environment.

*'''Don't''' become emotional - never show anger, frustration or fear.

*'''Don't''' call administrators for minor behavior infractions, such as talking, not sitting in the proper seat, chewing gum, etc. You will end up getting a bad reputation.

*'''Don't''' let more than 3 students go to bathroom, nurse etc. during period.

*'''Do''' call administrators if you are sworn at or threatened, students are fighting, or if you encounter a weapon or drugs.

*'''Do''' take attendance...several times.

*'''Do''' list your rules on the blackboard for the class at the beginning of the period.

*'''Do''' bring in an extra assignment - something fun, like a wordsearch.


Some techniques that have proven effective in even the most difficult of environments are listed below:

*When a student asks to use the lav, ask him or her to ask you in five minutes.  When the first student asks to use the lav, or nurse etc., tell him or her that you will let them go, but they must wait for five minutes.  This technique is usually effective at controlling the number of students who leave a classroom in a given period.

*Tell class you only let three people out of the class at the beginning of the class.  

*If possible, read out loud. Don't rotate reading around room - ask for volunteers.

*If a teacher leaves a lesson that you feel is inadequate, don't be afraid to add on to it.  For example, your sub plans might say:  &quot;''p.435, #2-8; ALL CLASSES''&quot;.  The teacher has spent very little if any time preparing this lesson.  Do the lesson with the class, but maybe have a wordsearch or a popular crossword to complete after this assignment is complete.  By the way, students will very seldom answer questions out of a textbook.  If you are in a class where this is the assignment, don't be surprised if there is a fair amount of chaos.

*Remember, it's not your fault if the students are not doing their work.  It is not a reflection on you.  Keep calm and professional at all times.  You are the leader of the class for that particular day. It takes a lot strength and fortitude, mixed with a great amount of compassion and empathy to teach in an inner-city school.  Do not become discouraged, and have high expectations for ALL students you meet. Students can feel high expectations and will strive to meet them. 


== For the classroom teacher ==


'''Make expectations of substitutes clear.''' 
Take the time to discuss your expectations of student behavior with substitutes early in the year in case you are absent. When you are going to be absent, take the time to write thorough plans that account for every minute of class time.  Consider leaving alternative activities in case the class finishes early. If you know that you will be absent, organize your students the day before by telling them your expectations, detailing the assignment, and stating simple consequences for lack of compliance. If the students will work alone, tell them so and write it into the sub plans.  If they will be in groups, define the groups and include that information in the sub plans.  Specify if students are allowed to move their desks or chairs, or if they're allowed to work sitting on the floor, or even out in the hallway, the library, or outdoors.  Always let the sub know if classwork, homework, etc. is to be collected, or if the students are to place their work in specially designated baskets, trays or folders.  Let the substitute know if this includes ALL work, or only completed work.  If the latter, then specify what is to be done with incomplete work.

Two very essential items are a time schedule of each period (necessary if working in middle or  high schools), and a map of the school, including a map of &quot;duty&quot; stations.

Never say, &quot;You have cafeteria duty during period 5.&quot;  What exactly does the duty entail?  Does the sub stand by the doors, walk among the tables of students, stand by the food line, etc.  What exactly is the sub supposed to be looking out for?  Another example:  &quot;You have bus duty outside door #35.&quot;  Does the sub stand on the sidewalk?  Does she stand right by the door but within the building?  Does she go up to each bus and greet the students as they come out?  Is she supposed to stop by the main office first, to get a walkie-talkie?  How do you use the walkie-talkie?  Another example:  If there is bathroom duty and the bathrooms have to be locked and unlocked for safety reasons, where would the sub find the key?

Please advise if there is an accessible restroom for the sub, and let the sub know where the restroom is located.  It's humiliating for an adult to have to ask strangers &quot;Can you please open up the restroom for me?&quot;  Some subs won't use the restroom all day just for that reason.

Lesson plan packets usually include information about fire drills, lockdowns, eating policy, etc.  Although it is the sub's responsibility to know these regulations, it would still be greatly appreciated if you leave a list of basics.  Here is an example:
1. No staff or students may eat or drink in the classroom. (Then the sub knows not to take her lunch break in the classroom.)
2. Only two students out at a time, regardless of where they are going. (Very straightforward and helfpul.)

It's probably best not to advise the sub about which student behaves and which doesn't.   Sometimes, it is the so-called &quot;good&quot; student or &quot;honor&quot; student who misbehaves, while many so-called &quot;troublesome&quot; students behave pretty well.  Don't scare the sub with a biased picture; let the sub make up her own mind about how each student or class behaved.

Also ask the substitute to leave you feedback on a standard questionnaire or simply by leaving you a note. When you receive negative feedback about a student or a class, be sure to address it and assign reasonable but firm consequences including a hand-written note and/or verbal apology from the student to the substitute.

'''Make expectations of students clear.'''
Give students no opportunity to contradict the substitute. Distribute copies of the plan to the class. A well-prepared group of students will most often comply with the substitute. Explain to students that they must be on their best behavior for the substitute since he or she won't know them as you do, and may misinterpret their well-meaning quips. Define best behavior for them.  Never make jokes about substitute teachers and don't let students think that you have low expectations for days that you aren't there. 

'''Make a lesson plan.'''
It is vital that you take an adequate amount of time preparing for a substitute teacher. Give the substitute as much detail as necessary to make your wishes clear.  Review, organize and clearly label materials to be left for the substitute. The substitute needs enough material to keep the students busy for the entire class period.  Your instructions should be fairly detailed and legible, leaving no doubt about what you are trying to accomplish on that given day.  It might even be a good idea to include the actual goals and objectives that you are trying to attain to.  But at all costs, leave the substitute more than enough activities/material to keep the students busy.  Also, if you copy a ditto, always make a few extra copies.

Subs are expected to bring SOME things with them (#2 pencils, red pens, etc.), but the school should provide the majority of materials, since the school administration has its own requirements about which supplies are desired.  If you wish to leave your desks and cabinets locked, that is understandable, but at least leave a large sealed envelope marked &quot;FOR THE SUBSTITUTE&quot;, containing all the items the sub will need for the day.  For example, if you want papers collected from all classes, make sure you leave binder clips, large paper clips, or a stapler with enough staples (rubber bands are not good because they can snap).

Try not to make procedures or terminology complicated (many subs have not yet learned about KWL, concept webs, Bloom's Taxonomy questions, context clues, etc.).  Do give as much work as you like, but keep methods and instructions as simple as possible.

'''One more piece of advice:''' find out which substitute is your students' least favorite.  Usually you can find this information out fairly easily.  For instance, when you tell them that you will be gone, some students will inevitably say, &quot;Don't get Mrs. so-and-so&quot;.  If there is a particular sub that your students do not want, seek that person out.  Usually, the reason that the students don't &quot;like&quot; the sub is because he or she does a pretty good job of carrying out your instructions. This could also be a result of a sub who is simply not good. You should use judgement in this case. Students do sometimes like subs who follow the lesson plan, some are just plain crazy. It could be a legitimate reason for not wanting a sub. Ask the students why they don't want this person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:private}} is a Java [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]]
which declares a member's [[Java Programming/Access Modifiers|access]]
as private. That is, the member is only visible within the class,
not from any other class (including subclasses). The visibility of 
{{Java:private}} members extends to [[Java Programming/Nested Classes|nested classes]].

Please note: Because access modifiers are not handled at instance level but at class level, private members of an object are visible from other instances of the same class!


Syntax:
 {{java:private}} {{java:void}} method();

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:boolean}} is a [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] which designates the {{Java:boolean}} [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]]. There are only two possible {{Java:boolean}} values: {{Java:true}} and {{Java:false}}. The default value for {{Java:boolean}} fields is {{Java:false}}.

The following is a declaration of a {{Java:private}} {{Java:boolean}} field named &lt;code&gt;initialized&lt;/code&gt;, and its use in a method named &lt;code&gt;synchronizeConnection&lt;/code&gt;.
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-1&quot;&gt;'''Code section 1: Connection synchronization.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 4, 6&quot;&gt;
private boolean initialized = false;

public void synchronizeConnection() {
   if (!initialized) {
      connection = connect();
      initialized = true;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The previous code only creates a connection once (at the first method call). Note that there is no automatic conversion between integer types (such as {{Java:int}}) to {{Java:boolean}} as is possible in some languages like [[C Programming|C]]. Instead, one must use an equivalent expression such as &lt;code&gt;(i != 0)&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates to {{Java:true}} if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is not zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:public}} is a Java [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] which declares a member's [[Java Programming/Scope|access]] as public. Public members are visible to all other classes. This means that any other class can access a {{Java:public}} field or method. Further, other classes can modify {{Java:public}} fields unless the field is declared as {{Java:final}}.

A best practice is to give fields {{Java:private}} access and reserve {{Java:public}} access to only the set of methods and {{Java:final}} fields that define the class' public constants. This helps with encapsulation and information hiding, since it allows you to change the implementation of a class without affecting the consumers who use only the public API of the class.

Below is an example of an immutable {{Java:public}} class named &lt;code&gt;Length&lt;/code&gt; which maintains {{Java:private}} instance fields named &lt;code&gt;units&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;magnitude&lt;/code&gt; but provides a {{Java:public}} constructor and two {{Java:public}} accessor methods.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing: Length.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4, 5, 16-18, 20-22&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.java;

public class Length {
   private double magnitude;
   private String units;

   public Length(double magnitude, String units) {
      if ((units == null) || (units.trim().length() == 0)) {
          throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;non-null, non-empty units required.&quot;);
      }

      this.magnitude = magnitude;
      this.units = units;
   }

   public double getMagnitude() {
      return magnitude;
   }

   public String getUnits() {
      return units;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The Gastrointestinal System is responsible for the breakdown and absorption of various foods and liquids needed to substain life. Many different organs have essential roles in the digestion of food, from the mechanical disrupting of the teeth to the creation of bile (which is an [[w:Emulsifier|emulsifier]]) by the liver. In order to understand the interactions of the different components we shall follow the food on its journey through the human body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Believe it or not, fake Seikos not only exist, they are fairly common.  For collectors, there is also the problem of &quot;FrankenSeikos&quot;, watches using authentic Seiko parts, but from various sources.  Sometimes frankens are merely repaired using whatever parts are available, but sometimes these are trying to look like a more collectable watch. 



Common Signs of a fake:

Electra 360.  These were cheap pinlever movements

Bling--Frequently an Electra, fake diamonds as markers.  These will frequently be missing in places.

Mismatch of movement number
Seiko movement numbers are the first 4 digits of both the dial and case numbers.  While sometimes backs are swapped, it may be a sign that the watch is fake, especially on a &quot;new&quot; or &quot;NOS&quot; watch.  

Mismatch between jewel count and movement:  

Vibration engraved:  One Feiko I wound up with had the back engraved with a vibrating engraver--A series of small dots rather than continuous lines.  This one also had no serial number on the caseback, and was marked &quot;Rotomatic&quot; on the dial, a Swiss trademark.  Inside was a Ricoh movement.  

5 etched on the crystal of a non-5 watch

Holographic sticker on the crystal

Look for signs that letters were removed before and after the name--Some watches were printed as ASEIKON or ESEIKOR, with ink that can be easily removed.  

Day/date disks poorly aligned, cheaply printed.  

&quot;Swiss Made&quot;--Seiko did not use Swiss movements, but some fakes have cheap Swiss or Hong Kong pinlevers. 

Pinlever movement

Chrome plated--Not sure of older Seikos, but from the late 60's on, silvertone Seikos were stainless steel, not chrome.  

Quartz Seiko 5  The 5 is always an automatic. 

Misspellings--One fake Seiko had &quot;Sevesteen jewels&quot; engraved on the rotor, visible behind the display back.

Poor quality/misaligned day or date wheels

Aseikon watches are sold by thieves who will place one dial over the a and the other dial over the n so the watch reads &quot;seiko&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trusses are series of trianglular supports with no intraspan loads.  Classified as two force members,the beams have applied forces only at the ends.  The resultant forces at the ends must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, along the line of the joints of the member. These forces are called axial forces. The member is said to be in compression if T is negative (ie, the forces at each end are toward each other) or in tension if T is positive.

The main strategies for analyzing trusses are the method of joints and the method of sections.

==Example 1==

===Question===

[[Image:StaticsTrussEx1.svg|thumb|Blue lines are members of the truss, the blue circle is the joint which all members are attached to]]

The following picture shows a three member truss.  Angles, and one force are given in the picture.  Find the force in the vertical and diagonal member by using what you know about equilibrium.

===Answer===

Assign a coordinate system.  In this problem a two dimensional X,Y plane can be used with the positive X axis being horizontal running from left to right(pointing to the right).  The Y axis will be vertical and pointing upwards.

Since this is a statics problem, the joint cannot move.  The only way the joint won't move is if the forces acting on it are in equilibrium (the net force must be equal to zero in all directions).  An intelligent step now would be to sum X and Y forces at the joint.

Assign variable names so you don't get members confused with each other, let's call the vertical member's tension &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; and the diagonal member's tension &lt;math&gt; T_2 &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = 0 = -10 - T_2\cos(30) + T_1\cos(90)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = T_1 + T_2\sin(30)&lt;/math&gt;

The cosine of 90 degrees is zero so &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; drops out.  You could also drop out &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; simply by noticing that &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt; does not have an X component.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = 0 = -10 - T_2\cos(30)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ T_2 = -11.547N&lt;/math&gt;

The negative sign indicates that the force is in the opposite direction as in the picture.  This means the member is in compression instead of tension.  Now we can solve for &lt;math&gt; T_1 &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = T_1 + T_2sin(30) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0 = T_1 + -11.547sin(30) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ T_1 = 5.774N &lt;/math&gt;

This answer came out positive, meaning the direction indicated in the picture was correct and the member is in tension.  

The problem has been solved, we know the force in every member of the truss and whether the member is in tension or compression.  If you are having problems visualizing the problem see if the image below helps.

[[Image:StaticsTrussEx1Ans.svg|thumb|center|This picture displays every force acting on the joint in the correct orientation, you can see that the forces add to zero so the joint will not move.]]

==Notes==
The moments about all axes must also be zero, but the moments are already known to be zero about the joint because all forces pass directly through the joint.

'''Keywords''' are special tokens in the language which have reserved use in the language. Keywords may not be used as identifiers in Java &amp;mdash; you cannot declare a field whose name is a keyword, for instance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== XML Style Sheet ==

Similar to the layout we visited in chapter 3, this style sheet lists each hotel in the XML document by country.  But this time some new features have been added.  Price range elements have been included, each hotel’s amenities are now listed, and the population of each country has been formatted to improve readability.


=== XSLT Functions ===

When formatting XML output, there may be times when you might want to massage the data or get certain values for display.  Placed within the XML style sheet, functions can be used to manipulate data during the transformation.  We saw an example of this in chapter 3 when displaying the number of hotels within a city.

&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;count(hotel)&quot; /&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;

In order to make the population a little easier to read in our style sheet, we need to separate the digits into groups of threes and add commas.  To do this we use the format-number( ) function.  The purpose of this function is to convert a numeric value into a string using specified patterns that control the number of leading zeroes, separator between thousands, etc.  The basic syntax of this function is as follows:

&lt;center&gt;'''format-number (number, pattern)'''&lt;/center&gt;

* number is the numeric value to be formatted
* pattern is a string that lays out the general representation of a number.  Each character in the string represents either a digit from number or some special punctuation such as a comma or minus sign.

In order to display &lt;population&gt; with the digits grouped by three’s using commas as the separator, the format-number function was used in line {51} of our XML style sheet.  

The following are the characters and their meanings used to represent the number format when using the format-number function within a style sheet:


&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;font-size:small; width:50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;10%&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; Symbol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Meaning &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;# &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;. &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;, &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;; &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;% &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;X &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‘  
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
A digit.&lt;br&gt;
A digit, zero shows as absent.&lt;br&gt;
(period) Placeholder for decimal separator.&lt;br&gt;
Placeholder for grouping separator.&lt;br&gt;
Separate formats.&lt;br&gt;
Default prefix for negative.&lt;br&gt;
Multiply by 100 and show as a percentage.&lt;br&gt;
Any other characters can be used in the prefix or suffix.&lt;br&gt;
Used to quote special characters in a prefix or suffix.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



There are numerous other functions that you may find use for within a style sheet.  The following are some additional numeric based functions that are useful when handling numbers within a stylesheet.

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;font-size:small; width:50%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;28%&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Name &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Description &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ceiling() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Returns the smallest integer that is not less than the number argument &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;floor() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Returns the largest integer that is not greater than the number argument &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;number() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Converts the value argument to a number &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;round() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Rounds the number argument to the nearest integer &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;sum() &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Returns the total value of a set of numeric values in a node-set &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

                                            &lt;BR/&gt;
                                            &lt;b&gt;

'''Figure 5-5  XML stylesheet – amenity.xsl'''

In the XML stylesheet, you will see two additional functions '''position()''' and '''last()'''.  The position function returns the position of the current context node in the current context node-set.  The last function returns the index number of the last node in the context.  To list each amenity for each hotel, the transformation checks to see if the current position of the node is different than the position of the last context node in the set.  If this returns true, then a comma is added as the amenities are listed.

Although this stylesheet builds upon the one we saw in chapter 3, notice the use of embedded tables to further specify the layout of the data being conveyed.  Values and their indicators have been separated into table cells, allowing for a cleaner look and feel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the first things that is going to strike many first-time programmers of the Win32 API is that there are tons and tons of old data types to deal with. Sometimes, just keeping all the correct data types in order can be more difficult than writing a nice program. This page will talk a little bit about some of the data types that a programmer will come in contact with.

== Hungarian Notation ==

First, let's make a quick note about the naming convention used for some data types, and some variables. The Win32 API uses the so-called &quot;Hungarian Notation&quot; for naming variables. Hungarian Notation requires that a variable be prefixed with an abbreviation of its data type, so that when you are reading the code, you know exactly what type of variable it is. The reason this practice is done in the Win32 API is because there are many different data types, making it difficult to keep them all straight. Also, there are a number of different data types that are essentially defined the same way, and therefore some compilers will not pick up on errors when they are used incorrectly. As we discuss each data type, we will also note the common prefixes for that data type. 

Putting the letter &quot;P&quot; in front of a data type, or &quot;p&quot; in front of a variable usually indicates that the variable is a pointer. The letters &quot;LP&quot; or the prefix &quot;lp&quot; stands for &quot;Long Pointer&quot;, which is exactly the same as a regular pointer on 32 bit machines. LP data objects are simply legacy objects that were carried over from Windows 3.1 or earlier, when pointers and long pointers needed to be differentiated.  On modern 32-bit systems, these prefixes can be used interchangeably.

== LPVOID ==

LPVOID data types are defined as being a &quot;pointer to a void object&quot;. This may seem strange to some people, but the ANSI-C standard allows for generic pointers to be defined as &quot;void*&quot; types. This means that LPVOID pointers can be used to point to different types of objects, without creating a compiler error. However, the burden is on the programmer to keep track of what type of object is being pointed to. 

Also, some Win32 API functions may have arguments labeled as &quot;LPVOID lpReserved&quot;. These reserved data members should never be used in your program, because they either depend on functionality that hasn't yet been implemented by Microsoft, or else they are only used in certain applications. If you see a function with an &quot;LPVOID lpReserved&quot; argument, you must always pass a NULL value for that parameter - some functions will fail if you do not do so.

LPVOID objects frequently do not have prefixes, although it is relatively common to prefix an LPVOID variable with the letter &quot;p&quot;, as it is a pointer.

== DWORD, WORD, BYTE ==

These data types are defined to be a specific length, regardless of the target platform. There is a certain amount of additional complexity in the header files to achieve this, but the result is code that is very well standardized, and very portable to different hardware platforms and different compilers.

DWORDs (Double WORDs), the most commonly occurring of these data types, are defined always to be unsigned 32-bit quantities. On any machine, be it 16, 32, or 64 bits, a DWORD is always 32 bits long. Because of this strict definition, DWORDS are very common and popular on 32-bit machines, but are less common on 16-bit and 64-bit machines. 

WORDs (Single WORDs) are defined strictly as unsigned 16-bit values, regardless of what machine you are programming on. BYTEs are defined strictly as being unsigned 8-bit values. QWORDs (Quad WORDs), although rare, are defined as being unsigned 64-bit quantities. Putting a &quot;P&quot; in front of any of these identifiers indicates that the variable is a pointer. putting two &quot;P&quot;s in front indicates it's a pointer to a pointer. These variables may be unprefixed, or they may use any of the prefixes common with DWORDs. Because of the differences in compilers, the definition of these data types may be different, but typically these definitions are used:

 #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;


 typedef uint8_t BYTE;
 typedef uint16_t WORD;
 typedef uint32_t DWORD;
 typedef uint64_t QWORD;

Notice that these definitions are not the same in all compilers. It is a known issue that the GNU GCC compiler uses the ''long'' and ''short'' specifiers differently from the Microsoft C Compiler. For this reason, the windows header files typically will use conditional declarations for these data types, depending on the compiler being used. In this way, code can be more portable. 

As usual, we can define pointers to these types as:

 #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;


 typedef uint8_t * PBYTE;
 typedef uint16_t * PWORD;
 typedef uint32_t * PDWORD;
 typedef uint64_t * PQWORD;

 typedef uint8_t ** PPBYTE;
 typedef uint16_t ** PPWORD;
 typedef uint32_t ** PPDWORD;
 typedef uint64_t ** PPQWORD;

DWORD variables are typically prefixed with &quot;dw&quot;. Likewise, we have the following prefixes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Data Type !! Prefix
|-
|BYTE || &quot;b&quot;
|-
|WORD || &quot;w&quot;
|-
|DWORD || &quot;dw&quot;
|-
|QWORD || &quot;qw&quot;
|}

== LONG, INT, SHORT, CHAR ==

These types are not defined to a specific length. It is left to the host machine to determine exactly how many bits each of these types has. 

;Types:
 typedef long LONG;
 typedef unsigned long ULONG;
 typedef int INT;
 typedef unsigned int UINT;
 typedef short SHORT;
 typedef unsigned short USHORT;
 typedef char CHAR;
 typedef unsigned char UCHAR;

;LONG notation: LONG variables are typically prefixed with an &quot;l&quot; (lower-case L).

;UINT notation: UINT variables are typically prefixed with an &quot;i&quot; or a &quot;ui&quot; to indicate that it is an integer, and that it is unsigned.

;CHAR, UCHAR notation: These variables are usually prefixed with a &quot;c&quot; or a &quot;uc&quot; respectively.

If the size of the variable doesn't matter, you can use some of these integer types. However, if you want to exactly specify the size of a variable, so that it has a certain number of bits, use the BYTE, WORD, DWORD, or QWORD identifiers, because their lengths are platform-independent and never change.

== STR, LPSTR ==

STR data types are string data types, with storage already allocated. This data type is less common than the LPSTR. STR data types are used when the string is supposed to be treated as an immediate array, and not as a simple character pointer. The variable name prefix for a STR data type is &quot;sz&quot; because it's a zero-terminated string (ends with a null character).

Most programmers will not define a variable as a STR, opting instead to define it as a character array, because defining it as an array allows the size of the array to be set explicitly. Also, creating a large string on the stack can cause greatly undesirable stack-overflow problems.

LPSTR stands for &quot;Long Pointer to a STR&quot;, and is essentially defined as such:

 #define STR * LPSTR;

LPSTR can be used exactly like other string objects, except that LPSTR is explicitly defined as being ASCII, not unicode, and this definition will hold on all platforms. LPSTR variables will usually be prefixed with the letters &quot;lpsz&quot; to denote a &quot;Long Pointer to a String that is Zero-terminated&quot;. The &quot;sz&quot; part of the prefix is important, because some strings in the Windows world (especially when talking about the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Driver_Kit DDK]) are not zero-terminated. LPSTR data types, and variables prefixed with the &quot;lpsz&quot; prefix can all be used seamlessly with the standard library &lt;string.h&gt; functions.

== TCHAR ==

TCHAR data types, as will be explained in the section on Unicode, are generic character data types. TCHAR can hold either standard 1-byte ASCII characters, or wide 2-byte Unicode characters. Because this data type is defined by a macro and is not set in stone, only character data should be used with this type. TCHAR is defined in a manner similar to the following (although it may be different for different compilers):

 #ifdef UNICODE
 #define TCHAR WORD
 #else
 #define TCHAR BYTE
 #endif

== TSTR, LPTSTR ==

Strings of TCHARs are typically referred to as TSTR data types. More commonly, they are defined as LPTSTR types as such:

 #define TCHAR * LPTSTR

These strings can be either UNICODE or ASCII, depending on the status of the UNICODE macro. LPTSTR data types are long pointers to generic strings, and may contain either ASCII strings or Unicode strings, depending on the environment being used. LPTSTR data types are also prefixed with the letters &quot;lpsz&quot;.

== HANDLE ==

HANDLE data types are some of the most important data objects in Win32 programming, and also some of the hardest for new programmers to understand. Inside the kernel, Windows maintains a table of all the different objects that the kernel is responsible for. Windows, buttons, icons, mouse pointers, menus, and so on, all get an entry in the table, and each entry is assigned a unique identifier known as a HANDLE. If you want to pick a particular entry out of that table, you need to give Windows the HANDLE value, and Windows will return the corresponding table entry.

HANDLEs are defined as being unsigned 32-bit quantities in &lt;windows.h&gt;, but HANDLEs should never be used like integers. They are unique identifiers, and if you edit them, or use them in arithmetic, then they can never be used to get the table entry that they correspond to. In other words, HANDLEs should be stored, but they should never be changed by the programmer.

HANDLEs are generally prefixed with an &quot;h&quot;. BHandles are unsigned integers that Windows uses internally to keep track of objects in memory. Windows moves objects like memory blocks in memory to make room, if the object is moved in memory, the handles table is updated.

Below are a few special handles that are worth discussing: 

=== HWND ===

HWND data types are &quot;Handles to a Window&quot;, and are used to keep track of the various objects that appear on the screen. To communicate with a particular window, you need to have a copy of the window's handle. HWND variables are usually prefixed with the letters &quot;hwnd&quot;, just so the programmer knows they are important.

Canonically, main windows are defined as:

 HWND hwnd;

Child windows are defined as:

 HWND hwndChild1, hwndChild2...

and Dialog Box handles are defined as:

 HWND hDlg;

Although you are free to name these variables whatever you want in your own program, readability and compatibility suffer when an idiosyncratic naming scheme is chosen - or worse, no scheme at all.

=== HINSTANCE ===

HINSTANCE variables are handles to a program instance. Each program gets a single instance variable, and this is important so that the kernel can communicate with the program. If you want to create a new window, for instance, you need to pass your program's HINSTANCE variable to the kernel, so that the kernel knows what program instance the new window belongs to. If you want to communicate with another program, it is frequently very useful to have a copy of that program's instance handle. HINSTANCE variables are usually prefixed with an &quot;h&quot;, and furthermore, since there is frequently only one HINSTANCE variable in a program, it is canonical to declare that variable as such:

 HINSTANCE hInstance;

It is usually a benefit to make this HINSTANCE variable a global value, so that all your functions can access it when needed.

=== HMENU ===

If your program has a drop-down menu available (as most visual Windows programs do), that menu will have an HMENU handle associated with it. To display the menu, or to alter its contents, you need to have access to this HMENU handle. HMENU handles are frequently prefixed with simply an &quot;h&quot;.

== WPARAM, LPARAM ==

In the earlier days of Microsoft Windows, parameters were passed to a window in one of two formats: WORD-length (16-bit) parameters, and LONG-length (32-bit) parameters. These parameter types were defined as being WPARAM (16-bit) and LPARAM (32-bit). However, in modern 32-bit systems, WPARAM and LPARAM are both 32 bits long. The names however have not changed, for legacy reasons.

WPARAM and LPARAM variables are generic function parameters, and are frequently type-cast to other data types including pointers and DWORDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In 1999, a study group on Veterinary Public Health (VPH), convened jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United nations (FAO), and the Office International des epizooties (OIE), and including twenty-eight experts from eighteen countries, defined veterinary public health as  &quot;the contribution to the complete physical, mental, and social well-being of humans through an understanding and application of veterinary science.&quot; The emphasis was on the human ecosystem where the contribution of veterinary science to human health has been fundamental and sustained over millennia. It is not generally appreciated that this contribution pertains not only to livestock and food production, animal traction, and transportation, which have laid the basis for most urban societies around the world. The study and management of animal diseases have also laid the basis for much of what we know about the dynamics and management of infectious human diseases, and the promotion of environmental quality.  

Defined as diseases transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans, zoonotic diseases (zoonoses) include bubonic plague, Lyme disease, salmonella, and rabies. Disease-carrying animals, called reservoirs, infect humans through several pathways: when they are eaten by humans, when they bite humans, or when arthropods that have fed on them, such as mosquitoes or ticks, then feed on a human host. It has been estimated that over 60% of infectious diseases impacting humans are zoonotic in origin and zoonoses are on the rise globally, accounting for over 75% of emerging diseases.

Many important human diseases have originated in animals, and so changes in the habitats of animals that are disease vectors or reservoirs may affect human health, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively.  For example, the Nipah virus is believed to have emerged after forest clearance fires in Indonesia drove carrier bats to neighbouring Malaysia, where the virus infected intensively farmed pigs, and then crossed to humans. Intensive livestock production, while providing benefits to health in terms of improved nutrition, has also created environments favourable to the emergence of diseases. Greater human contact with wild species and 'bush meat' from encroachment in forests and changes in diet also create opportunities for disease transmission. Trends ranging from forest clearance to climate-induced habitat changes also appear to have impacted certain populations of mosquitoes, ticks and midges, altering transmission patterns for diseases like malaria and lyme disease.

Until recently, zoonotic diseases have not been treated as part of ecological systems. In response to the prevalence of zoonoses, the multidisciplinary field of disease ecology has emerged. It involves the study of any ecological system that includes pathogens and incorporates the complexity of multiple interactions.  The research area covers basic processes underlying the linkages between climate, ecosystems, and infectious disease, particularly the different ways that climate can influence the emergence and transmission of infectious disease agents.  For example Mexican researchers adopted an ecosystem approach to better understand the complex set of factors that influenced the incidence and spread of malaria in Oaxaca. This project includes the molecular biology of the vector and the parasite, community perceptions of malaria, statistical analyses, and a geographic information-based surveillance system.  

Mammals are the most common reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, with rodents leading the pack. The plague (Yersinia pestis), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) all owe their spread to the presence of rodents. From an ecological perspective, rodents occupy the middle rung of the food chain. Primarily herbivores, with diets rich in plant matter, they are a food source for vertebrate predators such as foxes, and owls. 

Aquatic animals that carry human parasites are also a source of disease and death. The human cost is high: The World Health Organization (WHO 2004, 2) estimates that globally &quot;1.8 million people die each year from diarrhoeal diseases, 200 million people are infected with schistosomiasis and more than 1 billion people suffer from soil-transmitted helminthes infections.&quot; 

Unfortunately, agricultural systems, especially irrigated ones, have long been associated with manifestations of extreme human ill-health arising from water-related diseases. The major reason is that public health and disease control programs have not been concerns of the water resources sector, which typically has focused on potential economic benefits of water bodies in terms of food production and power generation. This theme of applied ecology aims to increase knowledge of the relationship between water, human health and ecosystems; and to develop practical measures to reduce negative environmental health impacts by:

* mitigating adverse impacts due to malaria and other water-related parasitic diseases through water and land management strategies;
* managing the agricultural use of polluted water sources (including urban and industrial waste) so as to optimize food production and livelihoods benefits and minimize adverse health and environmental impacts;
* exploring the trade-offs necessary to provide for environmental water requirements in river basins, the wise use of wetland ecosystems, and the conservation of biodiversity through the application of eco-agricultural principles.

Another important issue is the dangerous integration of circumstances when animals and consumers from different ecosystems come into contact. The lack of resistance to new pathogens makes humans and animals replicating reservoirs, for viruses and bacteria to adapt and rapidly mutate. Further, the staggering numbers of animals and people in contact change one-in-a-million odds of a disease transfer into almost a daily possibility. Even under the most hygienic conditions, this pool of viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens creates optimal conditions for diseases to multiply rapidly and jump between species to exploit new potential hosts; something the most &quot;successful&quot; diseases do all too well. Under this scenario, two problems are created. First is the high risk of new diseases spreading into human populations. Second is that this can create a &quot;fear factor&quot; amongst people - their concern that wildlife is unhealthy might cause them to try to remove the threat by killing the wildlife. Shooting flying foxes was proposed in Southeast Asia when they were thought to be carrying nipa virus, even though the link has not been definitively proven and the disease is rarely found in flying foxes.  

The global trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms that not only cause human disease outbreaks but also threaten livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and the health of ecosystems. Outbreaks resulting from wildlife trade have caused hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage globally. 

In almost all cases, eradication schemes are not cost efficient or effective means to reduce disease spread when compared to health education, sanitation, and controlling animal movement. Moreover, eradication schemes do not address the fundamental problem of our creating conditions, which maximize opportunities for disease build-up and cross-species transmission. Much research is still needed on the links between viruses in different species and human disease, and means of transmission between the two. Rather than attempting to eradicate pathogens or the wild species that may harbour them, a practical approach would include decreasing the contact rate among species, including humans, at the interface created by the wildlife trade. Since wildlife marketing functions as a system of networks with major hubs, these points provide control opportunities to maximize the effects of regulatory efforts.

Intensive production has also given rise to new disease problems, such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease) and Avian flu. These indicate the potential for disease transmission through human food chains that are now often extended halfway across the globe. Industrialized animal production systems are now major features of human ecology.  They have considerable impacts on the quality of the atmosphere, water and soil due to nutrient overloads; they impact terrestrial ecosystems directly and indirectly; in addition, disruption of marine fisheries occurs locally with pollution and runoff from production facilities and globally in terms of depletion of fish stocks where fishmeal has become a large commodity in the production of livestock feeds. 

The response to the fact that several vector-borne, parasitic or zoonotic diseases have (re)-emerged and spread in Europe with major health, ecological, socio-economical and political consequences, has been the establishment of EDEN (Emerging Diseases in a changing European Environment). Most of these outbreaks are linked to global and local changes resulting from climate change, human-induced landscape changes or the activities of human populations. Europe must anticipate, prevent and control new emergences to avoid major societal and economical crises (cf. SARS in Asia, West Nile in the USA). EDEN offers a unique opportunity to prepare for uncertainties about the future of the European environment by exploring the impact of environmental.  Other aims are to identify, evaluate and catalogue European ecosystems and environmental conditions linked to global change, which can influence the spatial and temporal distribution and dynamics of human pathogenic agents. The project will develop and co-coordinate at the European level a set of generic methods, tools and skills such as predictive emergence and spread models, early warning, surveillance and monitoring tools and scenarios, which can be used by decision makers for risk assessment, decision support for intervention and public health policies both at the EU and at the national or regional level. Part of EDEN's innovation will be to combine spatial data (earth observation data, GIS etc.) with epidemiological data.

EDEN has selected for study a range of indicator human diseases that are especially sensitive to environmental changes and will be studied within a common scientific framework (involving Landscapes, Vector and Parasite bionomics, Public Health, and Animal Reservoirs). Some of these diseases are already present in Europe (tick- and rodent-borne diseases, leishmaniasis, West Nile fever); others were present historically (malaria) and so may re-emerge, whilst others are on the fringes of Europe (Rift Valley fever) in endemic regions of West and Northern Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dynamic link libraries ==
'''Dynamic Link Libraries''' (DLLs) were introduced with the first releases of the Microsoft Windows operating system, and today are a fundamental structural component of the OS. They are found not only on the OS core, but as part of many of the frameworks created by Microsoft like the MFC, ATL, .NET, etc, even C and the C++ runtime libraries are distributed as DLLs.

DLLs allow certain code fragments to be compiled into a single library, and to be linked to by multiple programs. This means that only one copy of the library needs to exist, and multiple programs can share the functions and the data between them. The Windows system makes itself accessible, in several of its user-space features, by providing DLLs that programmers can use.  

The difference between a DLL and a static library is that when you compile your programs, the DLL is not compiled into your executable, but instead remains a separate module. This feature helps to keep executable size low, and also allows for a DLL to be loaded into memory only when it is needed. As a self contained entity a DLL also permits kick and target updates to the system and to applications. By simply replacing a DLL with a newer version that contains fixes or improvements, it is easy to extend the alteration to multiple dependent programs instantly.

The exact method of building a DLL file is dependent on the compiler you are using. However, the way in which DLLs are programmed is universal. We will talk about how to program DLL files in this chapter.

=== DLL hell ===
The common problem referred generically as &quot;[[w:DLL hell|DLL hell]]&quot; has always been a bane to Windows programmers and it really doesn't seem to have a solution in the horizon. The problem was stated in the 90s and that was when the term was coined. The issue is on the permissibility of the OS to let incorrect DLLs version to be loaded upon the request from an application, that would invariably lead to a crash. Today an application will simply refuse to run.

== __declspec ==

The '''__declspec''' keyword is a strange new keyword that is not part of the ANSI C standard, but that most compilers will understand anyway. '''__declspec''' allows a variety of non-standard options to be specified, that will affect the way a program runs. Specifically, there are two '''__declspec''' identifiers that we want to discuss:

*__declspec(dllexport)
*__declspec(dllimport)

When writing a DLL, we need to use the '''dllexport''' keyword to denote functions that are going to be available to other programs. Functions without this keyword will only be available for use from inside the library itself. Here is an example:

 __declspec(dllexport) int MyFunc1(int foo)

The '''__declspec''' identifier for a function needs to be specified both in the function prototype and the function declaration, when building a DLL.

To &quot;import&quot; a DLL function into a regular program, the program must link to the DLL, and the program must prototype the function to be imported, using the '''dllimport''' keyword, as such:

 __declspec(dllimport) int MyFunc1(int foo);

Now the program can use the function as normal, even though the function exists in an external library. The compiler works with Windows to handle all the details for you.

Many people find it useful to define a single header file for their DLL, instead of maintaining one header file for building a DLL, and one header file for importing a DLL. Here is a macro that is common in DLL creation:

 #ifdef BUILDING_DLL
 #define DLL_FUNCTION __declspec(dllexport)
 #else
 #define DLL_FUNCTION __declspec(dllimport)
 #endif

Now, to build the DLL, we need to define the '''BUILDING_DLL''' macro, and when we are importing the DLL, we don't need to use that macro. Functions then can be prototyped as such:

 DLL_FUNCTION int MyFunc1(void);
 DLL_FUNCTION int MyFunc2(void);
 .......

(just a note: Microsoft did not intend for this __declspec syntax to be used. Instead the intention was that the public api of a DLL would be declared in an &quot;exports&quot; file. However the above syntax, despite requiring the macro to switch it back and forth, was much more convenient and is pretty much used by all software today).

== DllMain ==

When Windows links a DLL to a program, Windows calls the library's '''DllMain''' function. This means that every DLL needs to have a DllMain function. The DllMain function needs to be defined as such:

 BOOL APIENTRY DllMain (HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved)

The keywords &quot;BOOL&quot;, &quot;APIENTRY&quot;, &quot;HINSTANCE&quot;, etc., are all defined in &lt;windows.h&gt; so you must include that file even if you don't use any Win32 API functions in your library.

'''APIENTRY''' is a keyword that Windows uses internally so you don't need to worry about it. The variable &quot;hInstance&quot; is the HINSTANCE handle for the library, and you can keep this and use it, or you can trash it. '''reason''' will be one of four different values:

;DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: a new program has just linked to the library for the first time.
;DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: a program has unlinked the library.
;DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: a thread from a program has linked to the library.
;DLL_THREAD_DETACH: a thread from a program has just unlinked the library.

The DllMain function doesn't need to do anything special for these cases, although some libraries will find it useful to allocate storage for each new thread or process that is being used with the library.

The DllMain function must return TRUE if the library loaded successfully, or FALSE if the library had an error and could not load. Applications that cannot successfully open a library should fail gracefully.

Here is a general template for a DllMain function:

 BOOL APIENTRY DllMain (HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD reason, LPVOID lpReserved)
 {
    switch (reason)
    {
      case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        break;
      case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
      case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        break;
      case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
 }

However, if you aren't interested in any of the reasons, you can remove the entire switch statement from your program and return TRUE.

== Linking a DLL ==

DLL libraries can be linked to an executable in two ways: Statically and Dynamically.

=== Static Linking to a DLL ===

When static linking to a DLL, the linker will do all the work, and it will be transparent to the programmer that the functions are located in an external library. That is, it will be transparent if the library writer has properly used the _DECLSPEC modifier in the library's header file.

When compiling a DLL, the compiler will generate two files: the DLL library file, and a static-linking stub .LIB file. The .LIB file acts like a mini static library, that tells the linker to statically link the associated DLL file. When using a DLL in a project, you can either provide the linker with the .LIB stub file, or some linkers allow you to specify the DLL directly (and the linker will then try to find the .LIB file, or may even attempt to create the .LIB file automatically).

=== Loading DLLs Dynamically ===

The real power behind DLL files is that they can be loaded into your program dynamically at execution time. This means that while your program is running, it can search for and load in new components, without needing to be recompiled. This is an essential mechanism for programs that allow plugins and extensions to be loaded at execution time. To Dynamically load the DLL file, you can call the '''LoadLibrary''' function to get a handle to that library, and then pass that handle to one of several other functions to retrieve data from the DLL. The prototype for LoadLibrary is:

 HMODULE WINAPI LoadLibrary(LPCTSTR lpFileName);

HMODULE is a HANDLE to a program module. ''lpFileName'' is the file name of the DLL you want to load. Keep in mind that when loading a module, the system will check in your PATH first. If you want the system to check in other specified directories first, use the '''SetDllDirectory''' function first.

Once a DLL is loaded, and you have a handle to the module, you can do various things:

*Use '''GetProcAddress''' to return a function pointer to a function in that library.
*Use '''LoadResource''' to retrieve a resource from the DLL.

Once you are finished with a DLL file, and you want to remove it from memory, you can call the '''FreeLibrary''' function with the DLL's module handle.

==URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection) / Common cold==

&lt;p&gt;Common. Take temperature and ask the patient the following:
Hot and shivery? / muscle pains? (signs of systemic viraemia)
Cough +/- sputum? (associated chest infection)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viraemia carries a risk of cardiac involvement with a predisposition to perioperative cardiac arrhythmias (dysrhythmias).&lt;br&gt;Associated chest infection may worsen with either general or major regional anaesthesia (impaired cough and ciliary escalator). Elective surgery should be postponed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apyrexial (&lt;37.5°C) and no muscle pains or cough: probably OK to proceed with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: the prodromal period of many systemic viral illnesses is indistinguishable from the typical short-lived URTI. The patient recovering from major surgery may find this complicated by a developing viral illness. &lt;p&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dubaduba. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dubaduba~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What are the Rules of Accounting? ==

'''Accounting''' is the mechanism used to record activities and transactions that occur within a business.. In its simplest terms, Accounting is the &quot;language of business.&quot; However, in order to have an understandable record, a standard set of rules for accounting within the U.S. has been established. These rules are called the '''Generally Accepted Accounting Principles''' (GAAP), and all U.S. businesses are expected to follow them. 

The '''first general rule''' of accounting is that every transaction is recorded. It has been said that businesses that do not record transactions, or incorrectly record transactions, are committing fraud, although this is not necessarily the case. Fraud is part of a much broader area called material misstatement which also can include error. An error is not necessarily fraud under the law. While there are exceptions to this rule, the guidance for applying those exceptions is specifically defined by GAAP, and is applicable to all businesses.

The '''second general rule''' of accounting is that transactions are recorded using what is called a &quot;double-entry&quot; accounting method. Originally developed in Italy in the 1400s, double-entry means that for a complete record of a transaction, two entries are made.'' For example, if you have $5 in cash, and want to buy some gasoline for your lawn mower, you take your portable gas can and your money to the gas station and exchange $5 in cash for $5 in gas. This transaction is recorded as an increase in the asset &quot;gas&quot; for $5, and a corresponding reduction in the asset &quot;cash&quot; for $5. In this example, one transaction contained two entries.'' This takes a little time to get used to, but it is a critical concept in basic accounting. Double entry is tied to the concept of Debits and Credits, which you will learn about in the next section. The act of recording transactions is commonly referred to as making journal entries. In a few more paragraphs, we'll discuss what a journal entry looks like.

The '''third general rule''' of accounting is that every recorded transaction is captured in a log called the &quot;General Journal.&quot;

In general, &quot;Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, summarizing and interpreting a business transaction.&quot;

To make this easier, we can follow the golden rules of accounting.  Accounts are one of three basic types:

| '''Nominal'''
| Temporary income and expenditure accounts for ''recognition of the implications of financial transactions during each fiscal term till finalization of accounts at term end''

Example: The ''Sales'' account is opened for recording the sales of goods or services. At the end of the financial period, the total sales are transferred to the revenue statement account (''Profit and Loss Account'' or ''Income and Expenditure Account'').

Similarly, expenses during the financial period are recorded using the respective ''Expense'' accounts, which are also transferred to the revenue statement account.
The net positive or negative balance (profit or loss) of the revenue statement account is transferred to reserves or capital account as the case may be.&lt;!-- End copied portion --&gt;

== The Nature of Accounts: Definitions ==

An ''''account'''' is a specific location for recording transactions of a like kind. For example, in the gas-for-cash transaction above, two accounts are used, a &quot;Cash&quot; account and a &quot;Gas&quot; account. Unused by that example, but described is an account for &quot;Equipment&quot; which would include the portable gas can and the lawn mower.

The basic types of accounts are:

''''Assets:'''' items of value that the company owns or has right to. Examples include: cash, real estate, equipment, money or services that others owe you, and even intangible items such as patents and copyrights.

''''Liabilities:'''' obligations that are owed to other parties. Examples include: wages payable, taxes due, and borrowed money (also called debt).

''''Equity:'''' the ownership value of a company. Examples include: common stock and retained earnings (we'll describe retained earning below in &quot;Financial Statements&quot;)

''''Revenues:'''' the mechanisms where income enters the company (note that revenue and income are not the same thing--they are used here to describe each other in basic terms only).

''''Expenses:'''' the costs of doing business. Examples include: salary expense, rent, utilities expense, and interest on borrowed money.

''''Income:'''' in U.S. business and financial accounting, the term 'income' is also synonymous with revenue; however, many people use it as shorthand for net income, which is the amount of money that a company earns after covering all of its costs.

== Overview of the accounting cycle ==

&lt;!-- This section can discuss the process of journalizing your transactions, then posting those transactions. --&gt;
When a transaction occurs, a document is produced. Most of the time, these documents are external to the business, however, they can also be internal documents, such as inter-office sales. These documents are referred to as a source document. Some examples of source documents are:
* The receipt you get when you purchase something at the store.
* Interest you earned on your savings account which is documented in your monthly bank statement.
* The monthly electric utility bill that comes in the mail.

These source documents are then recorded in a '''Journal'''. This is also known as a '''book of first entry'''. The journal records both sides of the transaction recorded by the source document. These write-ups are known as '''Journal entries'''.

These Journal entries are then transferred to a '''Ledger'''.The group of accounts is called ledger. A ledger is also known as a '''book of accounts'''. The purpose of a Ledger is to bring together all of the transactions for similar activity. For example, if a company has one bank account, then all transactions that include cash would then be maintained in the Cash Ledger. This process of transferring the values is known as '''posting'''.

Once the entries have all been posted, the Ledger accounts are added up in a process called '''Balancing'''. (This will make much more sense when you learn about Debits and Credits. Balancing implies that the sum of all Debits equals the sum of all Credits.)

A particular '''working document''' called an '''unadjusted trial balance''' is created. This lists all the balances from all the accounts in the '''Ledger'''. Notice that the values are not posted to the trial balance, they are merely copied.

At this point accounting happens. The accountant produces a number of '''adjustments''' which make sure that the values comply with accounting principles. These values are then passed through the accounting system resulting in an '''adjusted trial balance'''. This process continues until the accountant is satisfied.

[[../Financial statements/]] are drawn from the trial balance which may include:
*the [[../Income statement/]] 
*the [[../Balance sheet/]]
*the [[../Cash flow statement/]]

Finally, all the revenue and expense accounts are closed.

===Debits and Credits===

For the purposes of accounting, please forget what you know about credits and debits. In accounting, debit (Dr.) and credit (Cr.) have nothing to do with plastic cards that let you buy stuff. In fact, what most beginning accounting students need to know about Dr/Cr can be boiled down to two sentences.

&lt;center&gt;'''Debit is on the left. Credit is on the right.'''&lt;/center&gt;
How are debit and credit rules applied to different types of accounts?

{{center|
'''DEBIT'''......NATURE OF A/Cs.......'''CREDIT'''

Increase.........'''ASSETS'''........Decrease&lt;br/&gt;
Decrease......'''LIABILITIES'''......Increase&lt;br/&gt;
Decrease.........'''REVENUE'''.......Increase&lt;br/&gt;
Decrease.........'''EQUITY'''........Increase&lt;br/&gt;
Increase........'''EXPENSES'''.......Decrease&lt;br/&gt;
Increase........'''DRAWINGS'''.......Decrease&lt;br/&gt;
}}

In case of ASSETS and EXPENSES; increases go to the debit side, while decreases go to credit side. On the other hand, in case of LIABILITIES, REVENUE and EQUITY; increases go to the credit side and decreases go to debit side.

An account will have either a &quot;'''normal credit balance'''&quot; or a &quot;'''normal debit balance'''&quot;, depending on the type of account. The normal balance indicates which side of the account the amount goes to when the account balance increases. For example, the account 'Cash' has a normal debit balance: receiving cash results in a debit entry, spending it results in a credit entry.

Debits and credits may be derived from the ''fundamental accounting equation''. They result from the nature of double entry bookkeeping.  Two entries are made in each balanced transaction, a debit and a credit.  This allows the accounts to be balanced to check for entry or transaction recording errors.

{{bookkeeping journal
|name=Example
|page=1
|entry=
{{bookkeeping entry|date=2005&lt;br/&gt;Feb|day=1|description=account1|dr=350}}
{{bookkeeping entry|description=account2|cr=350}}
}}

''Owner's Equity = Assets - Liabilities''  is written from the perspective of the owner.  In accounting this is generally rewritten from the perspective of the business or commercial entity the books detail:

''Assets = Owner's Equity + Liabilities'' (Fundamental Accounting Equation)

Entries in the books are in pairs and track the advantage or asset of the company simultaneously with the disadvantage or liability.  In this view the Owner's equity is a claim of the investor against the company.

* On the left side or ''Assets'' side of the Fundamental Accounting Equation:
** Transaction halves which increase the business assets are &quot;debits&quot; on the left side of the equation.  
** Transaction halves which decrease the business assets are &quot;credits&quot;.  
* On the right or balancing side or ''Owner's Equity + Liabilities'':
** Transaction halves (i.e. the part of the transaction) that increase the Owner's Equity are credits to the company books as they are claims of what the company owes the owner or investor
** Transaction halves that decrease the Owner's Equity (dividends paid or loss writeoffs) are beneficial to the company's future financial position by reducing claims and are considered debits.
** Liabilities incurred by the business entity (which are tracked by the books) are credits
** Liabilities reduced or paid off are debits.

==Separate Entity Concept==

Even when a business has a single owner we make a distinction between the owner's assets and the assets of the business.  For example if the owner gives a van to the business this will count as capital introduced, if the owner takes a salary this will be accounted for as drawings.Famous case laws are &quot;salomon vs salomon &amp; co.ltd&quot;,Lee vs Lee's air farming ltd.&quot; etc


=== Journal Entries ===

All accounting transactions are first recorded in a ''journal''. The most common of these is the '''General Journal''', sometimes also known as the Book of Original Entry, because it is the first place a transaction is entered into the books. Journal Entries are made from ''source documents'', which can be anything from receipts to invoices to bank statements.

{{bookkeeping journal
|name=General
|page=1
|entry=
{{bookkeeping entry| date = 2005&lt;br/&gt;Jan| day = 1| description = Cash | dr = 10,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Sales | cr = 10,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = ''To record cash sales.''}}
{{bookkeeping entry}}
{{bookkeeping entry| day = 6 | description = Equipment | dr = 15,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = Accounts Payable | cr = 15,000 }}
{{bookkeeping entry| description = ''To record purchase or equipment on credit'' }}
}}

These two entries show the premise of ''double-entry accounting''. Note that the ''form'' of what is written is as important as the actual text:
*Debits are always recorded first, followed by the credits.
*In keeping with the rule of &quot;Debit = Left, Credit = Right&quot;, all accounts that are credited have their titles indented (&quot;Sales&quot; and &quot;Accounts Payable&quot; in this example).
*The year and month are only recorded once in the date column. They are recorded again at the top of every new page, and whenever the month or year changes. However, a new page is usually started at the beginning of each month, because end-of-period entries are normally recorded on a separate page.
*A description of each entry is placed on the line below the entry. While this is not required, it is good practice because, at times, account titles may not be enough to describe what actually occurred for a specific transaction.
*A blank line is inserted between entries.

The process of recording entries to a journal is called '''journalizing'''.

=== T-Accounts ===

&lt;pre&gt;
Form:                              Example:
    Account Name                          Cash
    -------------                     -------------
    Debit |Credit                   $750.00 |  100.00
          |                           65.00 |   80.00
   _______|_______                  ________|_______

  Balance | Balance                 $635.00 |
&lt;/pre&gt;
One representation of an account is called the '''T-account''', shown above. A T-account contains just the basic elements of the account, so it lacks the necessary detail for use in bookkeeping operations. However, it has its uses as both an illustrative tool and a quick reference.

Each account needs to have a unique ''Account Name'', such as Cash, for ease of reference later on. In modern accounting systems, you will often see an account number alongside the name in order to facilitate report generation and computer entry. Under the bar are the debit (from the Latin ''debere'', to owe) and credit (''credere'', to believe) columns.

As it shows in the example above, the balance of a T-account can be figured by first totaling each column. Second, subtract the smaller subtotal from the larger, and finally placing the total in the larger number's column.

=== Ledger Accounts ===

While a T-Account is useful for quickly summarising an account's balance, it only contains a fraction of the information that was recorded in the Journal.

===Types of Accounts===

&lt;center&gt;'''Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity'''&lt;/center&gt;

A central axiom for accounting is the accounting equation above. Depending on the type of company involved, Owner's Equity may be &quot;Shareholder's&quot; or simply &quot;Equity&quot;, but the equation holds. The list of all of the accounts (along with their respective account numbers) is called the '''Chart of Accounts'''

'''Asset accounts''' indicate what a company owns. This can be actual possession or the right to take possession, such as a loan extended to another company. Some assets are identifiable by the term ''&quot;Receivable&quot;''. Assets have a normal debit balance.

'''Liability accounts''' indicate what a company owes to others. Examples of liabilities include loans to be repayed and services that have been paid for that the company hasn't performed yet. Many liabilities can be identified by the term ''&quot;Payable&quot;'' in their account name. Liabilities have a normal credit balance.

'''Equity accounts''' are a group of accounts that represent the amount of owner's equity in the business. There are four main types of Equity accounts:

*'''Revenue accounts''' indicate revenue generated by the normal operations of a business. Fees Earned and Sales are both examples of Revenue accounts. Revenue accounts have a normal credit balance.

*'''Expense accounts''' indicate the expenses incurred by a business during normal operations. Most account names ending in ''&quot;Expense&quot;'' are classified as expenses. Expenses have a normal debit balance.

*The '''Owner's Equity''' or '''Owner's Capital''' accounts (for a Proprietorship/Partnership) or the '''Shareholder's Equity''' accounts (for a Corporation) indicate the owner's equity in the business. As the accounting equation indicates, equity is the difference between the assets of the company, and the company's debts. Equity accounts are directly affected by Revenue and Expenses, and the standard Equity accounts have Credit balances.

*'''Dividends''' represents equity removed from the business by the owners. In a proprietorship or partnership, each owner has an '''Owner's Withdrawals''' account. In a corporation, equity is removed by way of dividends, and a Withdrawal account is not needed. Since these accounts represent capital removed from the business, they have a Debit balance.

The effects of debits and credits on the types of accounts is shown on the following table:

==== Summary of types of account ====
The main axiom to remember is that :
*  ''Assets = liabilities + equity''' 
* Debits and credits are opposite , for any one type of account.
* At the first level of the equation,  on the left, debits increase, on the right, credits increase.
* Common assets accounts, that are short-term, liquid, or current,  are cash in bank, accounts receivable, inventory. They are on the left.
* common non-current asset accounts include property , plant and equipment. They are on the left, however changes to their value is accumulated in contra-asset accounts, called accumulated depreciation, and hence they are contra to debit being positive, credits increase accumulated depreciation. They can be thought of as negative asset accounts on the left, paired with a non-current asset account which shows cost value, or revaluation value, in which case they are also paired with a revaluation reserve account to show the amount of revaluation ( in order for the above equation to stay in  balance after revaluation).
* Common current liability accounts  are accounts payable, bills payable, salaries payable. They are on the right , so credit increases the liability and debit decreases.
* common non-current liability accounts include bank loans , debentures and mortgage payable, which all incur interest expense and are either repaid in full or incrementally over time with cash in bank. These are on the right too, so an initial credit establishes the long term liability, and debits coupled with cash in bank credits (decrease) account for repayment.
* Common equity accounts are divided according to the entity type: for a sole trader, it is owner capital ; for partnerships, there is a owner capital account for each partner; for companies, there is shareholder's equity, and a retained earnings account to hold accumulated profits. Equity is on the right, so ''credit increases equity''.
* Other accounts arise from temporary , periodic operations, and are '''temporary accounts'''. They mainly deal with recording accumulated changes to equity, and are usually divided into Incomes and Expenses. ''Income accounts move equity positively, so Credit increases Income accounts''. ''Expenses move equity negatively'', so increase in these accounts  decreases equity, ie in the same direction as Debit, so ''Debits increase expense accounts''.
* Common income accounts are  (operating) revenue, dividends, interest, gains.
* Common expense accounts are (operating) expenses such as Cost of Goods sold, salary expense, utilities expense (telephone, electricity), rent expense, insurance expense.
* When equity decreases, assets decrease by the same amount, or liability increases, in order to meet the equation. 
* As expense accounts decrease equity, they usual decrease assets , usually as a decrease in cash in bank. 
* A special type of expense is depreciation, which decreases non-cash / non-current assets, and for depreciable assets, usually there is a contra-asset account set up, called accumulated depreciation for each type of asset, to record the accumulated depreciation expense. When the accumulated depreciation equals the current assessed value of the non-cash asset, the asset can be disposed of, and ''written-down'' , so both the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the statement of accounts.
* Another special type of expense is bad debts expense, as they also do not decrease cash asset directly, but decrease accounts receivable asset. There is a contra-asset account which records bad debt expense accrued estimation,''allowance for bad debts'', which is eventually balanced in the equation with a decrease in accounts receivable asset when bad debts are determined to have occurred, and are ''written down'', and accounts receivable asset as well as the allowance have the amount determined to be bad debt ''written off''. ''Allowance for impairment of accounts receivables'' is another name for the allowance account, and it is deducted from the accounts receivables account on the balance sheet , in order to show that the accounting equation balances in the period when the estimated bad debts expense is incurred.

==Basic Accounting Principles==

'''Historical Cost Principle:'''
Assets and liabilities should be recorded at the price at which they were acquired. This is to ensure a reliable price; market values can fluctuate and be different between differing opinions, so the price of acquisition is used.

'''Matching Principle:'''
Expenses should be matched with revenues. The expense is recorded in the time period it is incurred, which means the time period that the expense is used to generate revenue. This means that you can pay for an expense months before it is actually recorded, as the expense is matched to the period the revenue is made.

'''Revenue Recognition Principle:'''
Revenues should not be recorded until the earnings process is almost complete and there is little uncertainty as to whether or not collection of payment will occur. This means that revenue is recorded when it is earned, which means the job is complete.

== Financial Statements==

The '''Income statement''' is a list of all inflows and outflows of economic benefits(revenues and expenses).

The '''statement of cash flows''' is a listing of the inflows and outflows of cash.

It follows the general subdivision of business activity into trying to make money by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.  ''Operating activities'' include the main business that is concentrated on, and paying taxes on this business, as well as interest for liabilities from owning non-current assets such as machinery to run the business. ''Investing activities'' include cash used for investment in plant and equipment or recovered from sale of plant or equipment, and  money made outside of the main business activity using resources available from the business : this include investing cash available in other investments , receiving cash   interest or dividends from continuing other investment. ''Financial activities'' are cash activities undertaken when other entities  invest in the operations of the main business. So finance activities include cash from issuing shares in the company, cash given as dividends to shareholders, cash from borrowing and cash out due to borrowing repayment .

Hence this derives a list of activities to account for cash flow:
* operating activities - cash from operations : customer receipts, and supplier payments ; cash paid for taxes; cash paid as interest for borrowings to operate plant and equipment.
* investing activities - cash out for purchase plant and equipment, and cash in from sale of these ; cash put in other investments; cash received from dividends received and from interest earned related to running other investments.
* finance activities - cash in from issuing shares, cash out from payment of dividends  ; cash in from borrowing money, cash out for repayment of borrowing

A few items are reported as netted if they are sufficiently short term or liquid ( such as other investments, equity shareholding changes) : e.g. &quot;quick turnover, short maturity and large - AASB 7&quot;;, but many items are required to be reported as gross i.e. cash out and cash in for the same type of item are required to be reported separately e.g. property sale and purchase, interest paid and interest earned , borrowings and repayment of borrowings.

== Basic Accounting  Classes Course Notes ==

* accounting transactions are entered as journal entries consisting of the Account name, and either a debit (left side) amount or credit (right side) amount. For each entry the debits and credits must balance, and overall on the trial balance (lists all the debits and credits for all the accounts) must always balance.

* There are 5 main classes of Accounts:	
					
** '''Assets''': Anything of value that the business owns. This includes tangible assets such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, buildings, and machinery, as well as intangible assets such as copyrights, trademarks, and goodwill. Asset accounts normally have a Debit (left side) balance. In transaction entries, a debit to an asset account shows an increase in its amount, while a credit (right side) indicates a decrease in the asset value.
*** Example: Buying Equipment for Cash. One asset (Equipment) increases, and therefore it is Debited. Cash, which is also an asset, is decreased with a Credit.
  Equipment (debit)			$40,000
      Cash (credit)			     $40,000

** '''Liabilities''': Debts and obligations that the business owes. This includes accounts payable, payroll liabilities, and long term debts (such as bonds). Liabilities accounts normally have a Credit (right side) balance. In transaction entries, a credit to a liability account signifies an increase in its amount, while a debit (left side) indicates a decrease in the liability value.
*** Example: Buying Inventory on credit. Merchandise Inventory (an asset) increases with a debit, and Accounts Payable (a liability) also increases with a credit.
  Merchandise Inventory (debit)	$100,000
      Accounts Payable (credit)		     $100,000

** '''Equity''': This is essentially the value that accrues (accumulates) to the owners (shareholders, sole trader…). This ranges from Partner 1’s capital, Partner 1’s profits, retained earnings, etc. Equity accounts normally have a Credit (right side) balance. In transaction entries in the journals, a credit to an equity account signifies an increase in its amount, while a debit (left side) indicates a decrease in the equity value.  Always keep the accounting equation in mind:
                 Assets = Liabilities + Equity				
Since Assets normally have a Debit balance and both liabilities &amp; equity normally have a credit balance, therefore applying the equation above, we always check that the trial balance has a NET value of Zero (the total debits and credits should match).

** '''Revenue''': This is the entire amount of income made through the sale of goods/services, and is sometimes referred to as Income or Sales. Depending on the nature of the goods / services being sold, companies track this account either as one big account (e.g. Sales) or as many separate accounts (e.g. Sales Prod 1, Sales Prod 2, Freight Income etc.). Revenue accounts normally have a Credit (right side) balance, and therefore a credit to a revenue account signifies an increase in its amount, while a debit (left side) indicates a decrease in the revenue amount.  A decrease of revenue would take place in circumstances such as for example sales returns and discounts (explained further down).
*** Example: Recording cash sales. Cash is debited because it is an increase in an asset account, and Sales is credited because a Revenue account is increased.
      Cash (debit)		       $112,000
      Sales (credit)			     $112,000
							
** '''Expenses''': These are the general costs of doing business. This would include operating expenses such as Salaries Expense, Rent Expense, and Advertising Expense, as well as non-operating expenses such as Loss on Sale of Assets. Expense accounts normally have a Debit (left side) balance. In transaction entries, a debit to an expense account signifies an increase in its amount, while a credit indicates a decrease (which rarely occurs, unless an error needs to be corrected).	
*** Example: The company rents office space at $15,000 per month. Rent Expense is debited, and Cash is credited.
  Rent Expense (debit)		$15,000
      Cash (credit)			     $15,000

* Some very important aspects to remember in addition to the above: 		
		
** '''Depreciation, Amortization, and Depletion''' are used to allocate the cost of an asset over its useful life.  Depreciation is the allocation over time of tangible assets, Amortization is the allocation over time of intangible assets and Depletion is the allocation over time of natural resources.'''Accumulated depreciation''' is a contra-asset account (with a normal Credit balance) used to keep a running total of the depreciation to date. The book value of any asset at any time is the Original Cost less any accumulated depreciation. Contra-asset accounts are listed in the assets section of the balance sheet along with the corresponding asset account, making it easier to see what the assets original cost was and what it is presently valued at. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable is also a contra-asset account with a normal credit balance which is netted against the Accounts Receivable account.

			
** '''Sales Returns and Allowances &amp; Sales Discounts''' are '''contra-revenue accounts''', and the normal balance of this account is a Debit. These are used to offset the revenue credit balance. 

								
** '''Cost of Goods Sold''' (COGS): This account is used to track how much you paid for goods / material that was held in inventory until it was sold. COGS normally is a debit balance.  This account is recorded in entries when a sale is made, and COGS is debited for the cost, while inventory is credited (asset account=&gt;decreased) for the cost.	

						
** '''Credit Notes/memo/refunds''' are used to refund customers if they return products bought from the company. The entry for this transaction is usually :
      Revenue (Debit)		sale price
      Inventory (Debit)                     Cost of product
                COGS (Credit)               Cost of product
                Cash or A/R (Credit)	    sale price

* a summary :
  assets ( current asset (cash in bank + accounts receivables - allowance for bad debts)  + ( non-current asset - accumulated depreciation) ) 
   = liability ( current liability + non-current liability ) 
   + equity ( capital + ( issued share equity + retained earnings ) 
   + change in equity ( income (revenue + gains )  - expenses ( operating + depreciation + bad debt ) - drawings )

      <text xml:space="preserve">Antipsychotics interact with a number of receptors, including dopamine receptors, the receptor system involved in psychosis, which is theorized to occur as a result of a functional excess of dopamine in certain parts of the brain.  Many antipsychotics work by targeting dopamine receptors, such that dopamine levels are reduced.  Antagonism of the dopamine D2 receptor subtype, is one well characeterized mechanism of action, although other receptors, including non-dopamine receptors, are involved, depending on the antipsychotic.

The older antipsychotics are also known as &quot;typical antipsychotics&quot; or &quot;first generation antipsychotics&quot;. More recently developed antipyschotics are also known as &quot;atypical antipsychotics&quot; or &quot;second generation antipsychotics&quot;. The atypical or second generation antipsychotics are also active at other receptors, including serotonin receptors, such that side effects, especially motor ones, are thought to be reduced. Neuroleptics is another commonly used name, although its use has fallen out of favor.

Well known antipsychotics include haloperidol (Haldol) and chlorpromazine (Thorazine), which are older agents. The newer agents, many developed near the 1990's, include risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), and aripiprazole (Abilify). Aripiprazole is thought to be a dopamine system stabilizer in that it acts as a funtional antagonist of dopamine where dopamine levels are in excess and a functional agonist where dopamine levels are low.

'Species re-introduction' is a process to establish a plant or animal in an area which was once part of its historical range, but from which it has been extirpated or become extinct.  'Species re-establishment' is a synonym, which usually implies that the re-introduction has been successful. The term translocation is used to describe the deliberate and mediated movement of wild individuals or populations from one part of their range to another. Reinforcement or supplementation means the addition of individuals to an existing population.

'Benign introduction' is a process to establish a species, for the purpose of conservation, outside its recorded distribution but within an appropriate habitat and eco-geographical area.

Zoos, aquaria, marine parks, insect houses, botanical gardens - all have their role to play in captive breeding of plants and animals to provide stocks for reintroductions, be it by actually conducting captive breeding, or providing expertise and help. It is estimated that there are about 500,000 animals in captivity in zoos throughout the world. However, it is widely believed that for best results, captive breeding must be done with minimum human contact. The survival of up to 60,000 plant species - about a quarter of the world's total - will be threatened over the next few decades by population growth, deforestation, habitat loss, destructive development and agricultural expansion.  Human survival is threatened by the destruction of plants on such a massive scale. In addition to the small number of crop plants we use for our basic food, many wild plants also have great economic importance, providing food, fuel, clothing and shelter for hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. Plants also supply medicines, especially in developing countries where vast numbers depend on wild plants for their traditional remedies. Plants also help maintain the planet's environmental balance and ecosystem stability and provide habitats for the world's animal life. 

===Botanical Gardens===

[[File:Botanical_garden_-_Cibodas_-_Indonesia_5.jpg|right|400px|Cibodas Botanical Garden in Java, Indonesia]]

There are about 1,600 botanic gardens in the world. They grow tens of thousands of plant species between them; probably as much as a quarter of all the world's flowering plants and ferns are in their collections. The increasing rate of the loss of plant diversity and wild habitats worldwide has encouraged many botanic gardens to become important conservation centres. 

In many countries, botanic gardens are amongst the leading, and sometimes the only, institutions involved in or capable of undertaking extensive work in wild plant research and conservation. Many new botanic gardens are being opened or developed to act as centres for plant conservation, study and education, particularly of plants native to their own regions. 

Botanic gardens can be defined as public gardens which maintain collections of live plants mainly for study; for scientific research, conservation or education. Many different types of botanic gardens occur, large and small. While their size and resources varies hugely, botanic gardens are united in the belief of the important role that they must play in preserving the world's plant diversity. 

* Botanical gardens grow large collections of endangered plants, holding them safely in cultivation or seed banks in case wild populations are destroyed. 
* They reintroduce plants back to wild as part of species recovery projects. 
* They undertake botanical research to document and record the plants of the world and their characteristics. For example, their collections of dried plants (herbaria) contain millions of specimens as a permanent global reference on plant diversity. 
* They promote environmental awareness amongst the general public through their education work. Globally, botanic gardens receive more that 150 million visitors each year. 
* They are expert centres for horticulture and training; knowing how to grow a plant may be a key to its future survival.

===Zoos and Other Institutions for Animal Breeding===

A commonly stated aim of many captive breeding programmes conducted in zoological parks is to produce founder populations for release into the wild in reintroduction programmes.  Not many zoos possess the know-how for seriously managing captive populations, though that is a situation that is rapidly changing. With new technology, like molecular and DNA analysis, species management has become easier and helps scientists avoid potential pitfalls. For example, mapping genealogical information also helps minimising inbreeding. 

Policy guidelines have been drafted by the Re-introduction Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in response to the increasing occurrence of re-introduction projects worldwide, and consequently, to the growing need for specific policy guidelines to help ensure that the re-introductions achieve their intended conservation benefit, and do not cause adverse side-effects of greater impact.

These guidelines are intended to act as a guide for procedures useful to re-introduction programmes and do not represent an inflexible code of conduct. Many of the points are more relevant to re-introductions using captive-bred individuals than to translocations of wild species. Others are especially relevant to globally endangered species with limited numbers of founders. Each re-introduction proposal should be rigorously reviewed on its individual merits. It should be noted that re-introduction is always a very lengthy, complex and expensive process.  The following sections which illustrate the requirement to integrate ecological knowledge with re-introduction, have been taken from the guidelines.

==Aims and objectives== 

The principal aim of any re-introduction should be to establish a viable, free-ranging population in the wild, of a species, subspecies or race, which has become globally or locally extinct, or extirpated, in the wild. It should be re-introduced within the species' former natural habitat and range and should require minimal long-term management.

The objectives of a re-introduction may include: to enhance the long-term survival of a species; to re-establish a keystone species (in the ecological or cultural sense) in an ecosystem; to maintain and/or restore natural biodiversity; to provide long-term economic benefits to the local and/or nataional economy; to promote conservation awareness; or a combination of these.

A re-introduction requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of persons drawn from a variety of backgrounds. As well as government personnel, they may include persons from governmental natural resource management agencies; non-governmental organisations; funding bodies; universities; veterinary institutions; zoos (and private animal breeders) and/or botanic gardens, with a full range of suitable expertise. Team leaders should be responsible for coordination between the various bodies and provision should be made for publicity and public education about the project.

===Biological===

::(i) Feasibility study and background research

An assessment should be made of the taxonomic status of individuals to be re-introduced. They should preferably be of the same subspecies or race as those which were extirpated, unless adequate numbers are not available. An investigation of historical information about the loss and fate of individuals from the re-introduction area, as well as molecular genetic studies, should be undertaken in case of doubt as to individuals' taxonomic status. A study of genetic variation within and between populations of this and related taxa can also be helpful. Special care is needed when the population has long been extinct. 

:Detailed studies should be made of the status and biology of wild populations(if they exist) to determine the species' critical needs. For animals, this would include descriptions of habitat preferences, intraspecific variation and adaptations to local ecological conditions, social behaviour, group composition, home range size, shelter and food requirements, foraging and feeding behaviour, predators and diseases. For migratory species, studies should include the potential migratory areas. For plants, it would include biotic and abiotic habitat requirements, dispersal mechanisms, reproductive biology, symbiotic relationships (e.g. with mycorrhizae, pollinators), insect pests and diseases. Overall, a firm knowledge of the natural history of the species in question is crucial to the entire re-introduction scheme.
 
:The species, if any, that has filled the void created by the loss of the species concerned, should be determined; an understanding of the effect the re-introduced species will have on the ecosystem is important for ascertaining the success of the re-introduced population. 

:The build-up of the released population should be modelled under various sets of conditions, in order to specify the optimal number and composition of individuals to be released per year and the numbers of years necessary to promote establishment of a viable population.
 
:A Population and Habitat Viability Analysis will aid in identifying significant environmental and population variables and assessing their potential interactions, which would guide long-term population management.
 
::(ii) Previous Re-introductions

:Thorough research into previous re-introductions of the same or similar species and wide-ranging contacts with persons having relevant expertise should be conducted prior to and while developing re-introduction protocol. 

::(iii) Choice of release site and type

:Site should be within the historic range of the species. For an initial re-inforcement there should be few remnant wild individuals. For a re-introduction, there should be no remnant population to prevent disease spread, social disruption and introduction of alien genes. In some circumstances, a re-introduction or re-inforcement may have to be made into an area which is fenced or otherwise delimited, but it should be within the species' former natural habitat and range.
 
:A conservation/ benign introduction should be undertaken only as a last resort when no opportunities for re-introduction into the original site or range exist and only when a significant contribution to the conservation of the species will result. 

:The re-introduction area should have assured, long-term protection (whether formal or otherwise).
 
::(iv) Evaluation of re-introduction site

:Availability of suitable habitat: re-introductions should only take place where the habitat and landscape requirements of the species are satisfied, and likely to be sustained for the for-seeable future. The possibility of natural habitat change since extirpation must be considered. Likewise, a change in the legal/ political or cultural environment since species extirpation needs to be ascertained and evaluated as a possible constraint. The area should have sufficient carrying capacity to sustain growth of the re-introduced population and support a viable (self-sustaining) population in the long run. 

:Identification and elimination, or reduction to a sufficient level, of previous causes of decline: could include disease; over-hunting; over-collection; pollution; poisoning; competition with or predation by introduced species; habitat loss; adverse effects of earlier research or management programmes; competition with domestic livestock, which may be seasonal. Where the release site has undergone substantial degradation caused by human activity, a habitat restoration programme should be initiated before the re-introduction is carried out. 

::(v) Availability of suitable release stock

:It is desirable that source animals come from wild populations. If there is a choice of wild populations to supply founder stock for translocation, the source population should ideally be closely related genetically to the original native stock and show similar ecological characteristics (morphology, physiology, behaviour, habitat preference) to the original sub-population.
 
:Removal of individuals for re-introduction must not endanger the captive stock population or the wild source population. Stock must be guaranteed available on a regular and predictable basis, meeting specifications of the project protocol. 

:Individuals should only be removed from a wild population after the effects of translocation on the donor population have been assessed, and after it is guaranteed that these effects will not be negative. 

:If captive or artificially propagated stock is to be used, it must be from a population which has been soundly managed both demographically and genetically, according to the principles of contemporary conservation biology. 

:Re-introductions should not be carried out merely because captive stocks exist, nor solely as a means of disposing of surplus stock. 

:Prospective release stock, including stock that is a gift between governments, must be subjected to a thorough veterinary screening process before shipment from original source. Any animals found to be infected or which test positive for non-endemic or contagious pathogens with a potential impact on population levels, must be removed from the consignment, and the uninfected, negative remainder must be placed in strict quarantine for a suitable period before retest. If clear after retesting, the animals may be placed for shipment. 

:Since infection with serious disease can be acquired during shipment, especially if this is intercontinental, great care must be taken to minimize this risk. 

:Stock must meet all health regulations prescribed by the veterinary authorities of the recipient country and adequate provisions must be made for quarantine if necessary.
 
::(vi) Release of captive stock

:Most species of mammal and birds rely heavily on individual experience and learning as juveniles for their survival; they should be given the opportunity to acquire the necessary information to enable survival in the wild, through training in their captive environment; a captive bred individual's probability of survival should approximate that of a wild counterpart. 

:Care should be taken to ensure that potentially dangerous captive bred animals (such as large carnivores or primates) are not so confident in the presence of humans that they might be a danger to local inhabitants and/or their livestock.
 
===Socio-economic and Legal===

:Re-introductions are generally long-term projects that require the commitment of long-term financial and political support.
 
:Socio-economic studies should be made to assess impacts, costs and benefits of the re-introduction programme to local human populations. 

:A thorough assessment of attitudes of local people to the proposed project is necessary to ensure long term protection of the re-introduced population, especially if the cause of species' decline was due to human factors (e.g. over-hunting, over-collection, loss or alteration of habitat). The programme should be fully understood, accepted and supported by local communities. 

:Where the security of the re-introduced population is at risk from human activities, measures should be taken to minimise these in the re-introduction area. If these measures are inadequate, the re-introduction should be abandoned or alternative release areas sought. 

:The policy of the country to re-introductions and to the species concerned should be assessed. This might include checking existing provincial, national and international legislation and regulations, and provision of new measures and required permits as necessary. 

:Re-introduction must take place with the full permission and involvement of all relevant government agencies of the recipient or host country. This is particularly important in re-introductions in border areas, or involving more than one state or when a re-introduced population can expand into other states, provinces or territories. 

If the species poses potential risk to life or property, these risks should be minimised and adequate provision made for compensation where necessary; where all other solutions fail, removal or destruction of the released individual should be considered. In the case of migratory/mobile species, provisions should be made for crossing of international/state boundaries. 

::(i) Planning, preparation and release stages

:Approval of relevant government agencies and land owners, and coordination with national and international conservation organizations.
 
:Construction of a multidisciplinary team with access to expert technical advice for all phases of the programme. 

:Identification of short- and long-term success indicators and prediction of programme duration, in context of agreed aims and objectives. 

:Securing adequate funding for all programme phases. 

:Design of pre- and post- release monitoring programme so that each re-introduction is a carefully designed experiment, with the capability to test methodology with scientifically collected data. Monitoring the health of individuals, as well as the survival, is important; intervention may be necessary if the situation proves unforseeably favourable. 

:Appropriate health and genetic screening of release stock, including stock that is a gift between governments. Health screening of closely related species in the re-introduction area. 

:If release stock is wild-caught, care must be taken to ensure that: a) the stock is free from infectious or contagious pathogens and parasites before shipment and b) the stock will not be exposed to vectors of disease agents which may be present at the release site (and absent at the source site) and to which it may have no acquired immunity. 

:If vaccination prior to release, against local endemic or epidemic diseases of wild stock or domestic livestock at the release site, is deemed appropriate, this must be carried out during the &quot;Preparation Stage&quot; so as to allow sufficient time for the development of the required immunity. 

:Appropriate veterinary or horticultural measures as required to ensure health of released stock throughout the programme. This is to include adequate quarantine arrangements, especially where founder stock travels far or crosses international boundaries to the release site. 

:Development of transport plans for delivery of stock to the country and site of re-introduction, with special emphasis on ways to minimize stress on the individuals during transport. 

:Determination of release strategy (acclimatization of release stock to release area; behavioural training - including hunting and feeding; group composition, number, release patterns and techniques; timing). 

:Establishment of policies on interventions (see below). 

:Development of conservation education for long-term support; professional training of individuals involved in the long-term programme; public relations through the mass media and in local community; involvement where possible of local people in the programme. 

:The welfare of animals for release is of paramount concern through all these stages. 

::(ii) Post-release activities'''

:Post release monitoring is required of all (or sample of) individuals. This most vital aspect may be by direct (e.g. tagging, telemetry) or indirect (e.g. spoor, informants) methods as suitable. 
:Demographic, ecological and behavioural studies of released stock must be undertaken. 
:Study of processes of long-term adaptation by individuals and the population. 
:Collection and investigation of mortalities. 
:Interventions (e.g. supplemental feeding; veterinary aid; horticultural aid) when necessary. 
:Decisions for revision, rescheduling, or discontinuation of programme where necessary. 
:Habitat protection or restoration to continue where necessary. 
:Continuing public relations activities, including education and mass media coverage. 
:Evaluation of cost-effectiveness and success of re- introduction techniques. 
:Regular publications in scientific and popular literature.

= Free and Bound Variables =

== Informal notions ==

The two English sentences,

: If Socrates is a person, then Socrates is mortal,
: if Aristotle is a person, then Aristotle is mortal,

are both true.  However, outside any context supplying a reference for 'it',

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If it is a person, then it is mortal,

is neither true nor false.  'It' is not a name, but rather an empty placeholder.  'It' can refer to an object by picking up its reference from the surrounding context.  But without such context, there is no reference and no truth or falsity.  The same applies to the variable &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If ''x'' is a person, then ''x'' is mortal.

This situation changes with the two sentences:

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For any object, if it is a person, then it is mortal,
: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For any object ''x'', if ''x'' is a person, then ''x'' is mortal.

Neither the occurrences of 'it' nor the occurrences of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in these sentences refer to specific objects as with 'Socrates' or 'Aristotle'.  But (3) and (4) are nonetheless true.  (3) is true if and only if:

: (5) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Replacing both occurrences of 'it' in (3) with a reference to any object whatsoever (the same object both times) yields a true result.

But (5) is true and so is (3).  Similarly, (4) is true if and only if:

: (6) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Replacing both occurrences of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in (4) with a reference to any object whatsoever (the same object both times) yields a true result.

But (3) is true and so is (4).  We can call the occurrences of 'it' in (1) free and the occurrences of 'it' in (3) bound.  Indeed, the occurrences of 'it' in (3) are bound by the phrase 'for any'.  Similarly, the occurrences &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in (2) are free while those in (4) are bound.  Indeed, the occurrences of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in (4) are bound by the phrase 'for any'.

''An occurrence of a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is bound'' in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if that occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; stands within a subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; having one of the two forms:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \psi\ ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\exists \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the formula

: &lt;math&gt;(7) \quad (\exists x_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \forall y_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(y_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Both instances of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are bound in (7) because they stand within the subformula

: &lt;math&gt;\exists x_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, both instances of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are bound in (7) because they stand within the subformula

: &lt;math&gt;\forall y_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(y_0)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


''An occurrence of a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is free'' in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not bound in &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The occurrences of both &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(8) \quad (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{G^1_0}(y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are free in (8) because neither is bound in (8).


We say that ''an occurrence of a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is bound in by a particular occurrence'' of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if that occurrence is also the first (and perhaps only) symbol in the shortest subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the formula

: &lt;math&gt;(9) \quad \forall x_0\, (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \forall x_0\, \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The third and fourth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9) are bound by the second occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  However, they are not bound by the first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  The occurrence of

: &lt;math&gt;(10) \quad \forall x_0\, \mathrm{G^1_0}(x_0)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in (9)&amp;mdash;as well as the occurrence of (9) itself in (9)&amp;mdash;are subformulae of (9) beginning with a quantifier.  That is, both are subformula of (9) having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Both contain the second third and fourth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  However, the occurrence of (10) in (9) is the ''shortest'' subformula of (9) that meets these conditions.  That is, the occurrence of (10) in (9) is the shortest subformula of (9) that both (i) has this form and (ii) contains the third and fourth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  Thus it is the second, not the first, occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9) that binds the third and forth occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).  The first occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\forall\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9) ''does'', however, bind the first two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (9).


We also say that ''an occurrence of a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ''is bound in by a particular occurrence'' of &lt;math&gt;\exists\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if that occurrence is also the first (and perhaps only) symbol in the shortest subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\exists \alpha\, \psi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Finally, we say that ''a variable'' &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (not a particular occurrence of it) ''is bound (or free)'' in a formula if the formula contains a bound (or free) occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is both bound and free in

: &lt;math&gt;(\forall x_0\, \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

since this formula contains both bound and free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, the first two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are bound and the last is free.

== Sentences and formulae ==

A ''sentence'' is a formula with no free variables.  Sentential logic had no variables at all, so all formulae of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are also sentences of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In predicate logic and its language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, however, we have formulae that are not sentences.  All of (7), (8), (9), and (10) above are formulae.  Of these, only (7), (9), and (10) are sentences.  (8) is not a sentence because it contains free variables.

       if typeOf e1 &lt;&gt; BoolTy then raise Err
       else if typeOf e2 &lt;&gt; typeOf e3 then raise Err
       else typeOf e2

== Examples ==

All occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(11) \quad \forall x_0 (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound in the formula.  The lone occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is free in the formula.  (11) is a formula but not a sentence.

Only the first two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(12) \quad (\forall x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound in the formula.  The last occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the lone occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the formula are free in the formula.  (12) is a formula but not a sentence.

All four occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(13) \quad (\forall x_0 \mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \exists x_0 \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound.  The first two are bound by the universal quantifier, the last two are bound by the existential quantifier.  The lone occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the formula is free.    (13) is a formula but not a sentence.

All three occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in

: &lt;math&gt;(14) \quad \forall x_0 (\mathrm{F^1_0}(x_0) \rightarrow  \exists y_0 \mathrm{G^2_0}(x_0, y_0))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are bound by the universal quantifier.  Both occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the formula are bound by the existential quantifier.  (14) has no free variables and so is a sentence and as well as a formula.</text>

== What is a low-sodium diet? ==

A low-sodium diet is normally advised for people who suffer from heart and blood related conditions, such as high blood pressure, angina and for people who have previously suffered heart attacks (myocardial infarction), and also for people who have suffered, or who are prone to, conditions such as stroke or CVA (cerebrovascular attack).

Foods prepared and cooked for patients on this diet should contain as little added salt as possible, preferably none. This allows the consumer to season the food according to their own taste.  Generally meals falling into this category contain &lt; 0.5 grams of sodium per portion (about 1/8tsp).

Some people find food in this dietary grouping quite bland and &quot;boring&quot;, so it is up to the preparer to find new and interesting ways to season the food, in order to provide as much taste as possible, with little salt or sodium. To improve the flavours of sodium-free food, one can add combinations of herbs and spices. 

If you have just started a sodium-free diet, it will take at least 2 weeks for your palate to adjust to the lack of salt.</text>

== Solutions ==

I'm learning Haskell, so I decided to do the exercises on this page.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 -- 1.
 takeInt :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 takeInt 0 _ = []
 takeInt m (n:ns) = n : takeInt (m-1) ns
 main = print (takeInt 4 [11,21,31,41,51,61])

 -- 2.
 dropInt :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 dropInt 0 n = n
 dropInt m (n:ns) = dropInt (m-1) ns
 main = print (dropInt 3 [11,21,31,41,51])

 -- 3.
 sumInt :: [Integer] -&gt; Integer
 sumInt [] = 0
 sumInt (n:ns) = n + (sumInt ns)
 main = print (sumInt [1..5])

 -- 4.
 scanSum :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 scanSum n = scanSum' n 0
 scanSum' [] _ = []
 scanSum' (n:ns) a = n+a : (scanSum' ns (n+a))
 main = print (scanSum [2,3,4,5])

 -- 5.
 diffs :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 diffs [] = []
 diffs (m:[]) = []
 diffs (m:n:ns) = n-m : (diffs (n:ns))
 main = print (diffs [3,5,6,8])
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
--[[User:Colonel panic|Colonel panic]] 21:14, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Maybe something like this is what the author was looking for, based on the hint:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 -- 5.
 diffs' :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 diffs' _ [] = []
 diffs' [] _ = []
 diffs' (a:ax) (b:bx) = (b-a) : diffs' ax bx
 diffs :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 diffs [] = []
 diffs (a:ax) = diffs' (a:ax) ax
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

-- [[User:Fshahriar|Fshahriar]] 23:44, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

I think it would be more intuitive to substract the second from first element, and so on. At least when I read &quot;difference between adjacent elements&quot; I immediatly thought that [3,5,6,8] should produce [-2,-1,-2], only the example clarifies that.

-- Moritz, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

:Hi folks, would you maybe consider updating the [[Haskell/Solutions/More_about_lists|solutions page]] to this module?  Thanks -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:28, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

== Alternate Solution for scanSum ==

There's a solution for creating scanSum with only one function.  The trick is in the pattern matching - &quot;(x:y:zs)&quot; will match the first element in a set, the second element, and the remainder.

== Aborting evaluation ==

The note about aborting evaluation is useful here, but it may be a good idea to also include it in an earlier chapter, where factorial is introduced.  In that chapter, it mentions that you can get into an infinite loop by feeding in a negative number, but it doesn't tell you how to abort.  Also, it may be a good idea to spell out the keypress, in the case that the reader doesn't know what &quot;C-c&quot; means.  [[User:65.201.194.91|65.201.194.91]] 23:13, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

== head/tail ==
ghci gives an error on compiling your solution of the head/tail-based implementation of &quot;lastOf&quot;:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 lastOf :: [a] -&gt; a
 lastOf [] = error &quot;Empty list&quot;
 lastOf ls = if (tail ls == [])
   then head ls
   else lastOf ls
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Error:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
    Could not deduce (Eq a) from the context ()
      arising from a use of `==' at taken.hs:68:15-29
    Possible fix:
      add (Eq a) to the context of the type signature for `lastOf'
    In the predicate expression: (tail ls) == []
    In the expression: if (tail ls) == [] then head ls else lastOf ls
    In the definition of `lastOf':
        lastOf ls = if (tail ls) == [] then head ls else lastOf ls
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Before giving this solution,  you should explain the expression Eq.

By the way there is an error in the last line; it should read: &quot;else lastOf (tail ls)&quot;. The complete correct function would be:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 lastEl2 :: Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
 lastEl2 [] = error &quot;empty list&quot;
 lastEl2 ls = if (tail ls == []) 
   then head ls 
   else lastEl2 (tail ls) 
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

: Well spotted... going to fix both of these issues. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 15:00, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

== Rewrite of list comprehensions section ==

As a newbie Haskeller I am following this book chapter by chapter. When I reached the list comprehensions subsection it kind of bothered me because:

* Many of the examples and commentaries were distracting and only tangentially related to the main subject.
* Some of the code examples relied on language features not yet covered at this point of the book.
* As a whole, it made the list comprehensions look far more complicated than they actually are.

In order to alleviate these problems I performed a substantial rewrite of the section. Some details - and, crucially, good exercises - are still to be added, but the key changes are already in place. Since I am still a newbie, I feel it would be mandatory to have the changes discussed and reviewed by more experienced people, so I invite you all to do so. Thanks! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 18:47, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks, and much appreciated! On first glance, your edits sound great to me, but I'll check them in detail when I've got the time.
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 18:43, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

:: Your changes to the list comprehensions are fine. Note, however, that list comprehensions are even more general, they also involve &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the following
:: &lt;code&gt;[ (x,y,z) | x&lt;-[1..50], y&lt;-[1..50], z&lt;-[1..50], x^2 + y^2 == z^2]&lt;/code&gt;
:: lists all the Pythagorean triples with numbers smaller than 50.

:: Concerning the order of the list chapters, however, I recommend the following order for the different functions and concepts:
:: 1 - (:) and [], head and tail
:: 2 - map, filter, [1..100] syntax
:: 3 - list comprehensions as a more readable syntax for  map  and filter.
:: 4 - (++), concat
:: 5 - Defining recursive functions on lists, zip
:: 6 - sum, product, all, any; then show that they are special cases of fold
:: -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 14:16, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

== Renaming to be more clear ==

This chapter covers generalized functions, currying, and mapping… Mostly, it is about how functions work and the concepts aren't all that list-specific. It could have a much more precise chapter title than &quot;More about lists&quot;[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 23:51, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
: Possibly, but there are some subtle issues involved. While about half of the chapter is about lists, the more interesting parts are in the other half. On the other hand, the discussions about functions here aim at introducing &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; as a key function on lists, and not as a convenient example of something else. It's just that higher order functions are too important for their first example to be presented as a black box. There are deeper discussions of higher order functions, partial application and related matters in &quot;More on Functions&quot; and &quot;Higher Order Functions&quot;; however I do not see that as duplication, but as deliberate strategy (i.e. introducing a concept in a very elementary way and then later coming back to it with a deeper treatment). You will find that strategy is used for a few other themes in the book.
: The peculiar status of &quot;More About Lists&quot; and &quot;List Processing&quot; (the latter, in my opinion, has an even worse name than this one) is in part due to historical reasons. In essence, they are a single chapter which was arbitrarily divided in two because it was too big. That is why there is no introductory paragraph in &quot;List Processing&quot;. Furthermore, back in 2010 I swapped large amounts of text between the two chapters in order to eliminate circular dependencies between the topics. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 07:51, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== Code in &quot;Generalizing even further&quot; is incorrect ==

The following code from this chapter causes an error in GHC.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
applyToIntegers :: (Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
applyToIntegers _ [] = []
applyToIntegers f (n:ns) = (f n) : applyToIntegers f ns

multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList = applyToIntegers (*)
&lt;/source&gt;
In the above code, &lt;tt&gt;multiplyList&lt;/tt&gt; is a partially-applied version of &lt;tt&gt;applyToIntegers&lt;/tt&gt;, meaning that it takes an argument of type &lt;tt&gt;[Integer]&lt;/tt&gt; and returns a value of type &lt;tt&gt;[Integer]&lt;/tt&gt;. Its type signature, however, states otherwise: that it takes two arguments, of type &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[Integer]&lt;/tt&gt;, respectively. GHCi complains about this as follows:

&lt;tt&gt;
 Couldn't match type `[Integer]' with `Integer'
 Expected type: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 Actual type: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
 In the return type of a call of `applyToIntegers'&lt;/tt&gt;

The definition of &lt;tt&gt;multiplyList&lt;/tt&gt; should be either of the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList = applyToIntegers . (*)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList x = applyToIntegers ((*) x)
&lt;/source&gt;

Which is better given the context of the lesson?

Since I don't think composition (.) is really discussed that much until the later chapter &quot;Higher-order functions and Currying,&quot; your second suggestions seems better to me at this point in the tutorial. Another possible way to correct this, (which as a novice seems to flow best in my thought pattern but may not be idiomatic Haskell) is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList x = applyToIntegers (x *)
&lt;/source&gt;

: Thanks for the correction, it was meant to be as you two have written. &lt;code&gt;((*) x)&lt;/code&gt; is the best phrasing at this point, both because it's better to wait for &quot;Higher-order functions&quot; to go full point-free and because in Haskell Basics/Elementary Haskell we avoid insisting much on syntactic variations, as they can distract away from the key points (so sections can wait till &quot;More on functions&quot;). As for the final question, personally I prefer &lt;code&gt;(x *)&lt;/code&gt; in actual code, and &lt;code&gt;. (*)&lt;/code&gt; when proving things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Student Congress is==
Student Congress (Legislative debate) is a high school co-curricular imitating our US Congress. It provides students with the
opportunity to combine the traditional oratory skills of speech and debate with the
interpersonal skills of working and negotiating with others. As members of congress,
students are offered the chance to think and reflect on some of the most difficult and
important issues facing the world today. In a number of ways, Student Congress
provides an education that can exceed the typical education received by many students
in the classroom. The active and engaging environment of congress challenges students
to consider, analyze, and articulate public policy ideas and positions.

There is a related book on this wiki:
* [[Issue Guide]] which covers debating topics in general.  Some of the topics in that book may be useful in student debates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have read the page, and corrected some minor errors in spelling.

Is there an &quot;in place&quot; space for criticism of Islam?
(obviously, criticism should not be directed to this page.)

Is this something to be handled inside of this wiki city, or, outside
of it?

Thanks.

Criticism against Islam is not allowed inside the book. The reason is this book should contains real life muslim view and practice on their religion. However you have two choice.

# You can put links on the sources part
# Put you critics here in discussion.

I do not understand why this is in My Talk as I have made no contributions to such a discussion!
Why has this come to me?
-
Probably a mistake. The entry in your Talk is deleted, and this entry will be as well.

== Spin off this book ==

In the future, I will spin off this book.
Reason:
# Incompatibility: The [[Islam Way of Life]] talks about The Ancient Islam (not a religion), while this book about The Modern Islam (a religion)
# Too big for a chapter: This book will be expanded with more detail. 

Steps to spin off this book:
# Rename from &quot;Muslim Life&quot; to &quot;Practising Islam&quot;
# Add More Practical Detail (such as types of Zakat)
# Add More Example Story (such as paying Zakat as an employee)
# Add Reference to Fiqh Book (such as Imam Nawawi)
# Spin off the Book

Now that you now how to create a schema to define a conceptual primary/foreign key relationship, you need to know how to access and display that data. Take a look at the stylesheet below for an example. 
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;670&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; bgcolor=&quot;lightyellow&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

xmlns:fo=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format&quot;&gt;

&lt;!-- See note below about new elements added  --&gt;

&lt;xsl:key name=&quot;predecessor&quot; match=&quot;president&quot; use=&quot;@primaryKey&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--xsl:key name=&quot;name referenced from within XSL file&quot; match=&quot;element in XML file containing key&quot;
use=&quot;attribute or sub-element containing actual value of key &quot;--&gt;
&lt;!--key() function use: key('predecessor',2) will return the nodes contained 
by the president element with attribute: primaryKey=&quot;2&quot;
Since a node list is returned, &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;key('predecessor',2)/firstName&quot;/&gt; 
will output John --&gt;
	&lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
		&lt;table style=&quot;font-family:arial&quot;&gt;
			&lt;tr style=&quot;background-color:#6495ED;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;

						&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
						&lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
							&lt;!--Equivolent to else--&gt;
							&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;SMALL&gt;'''Table 6-3:  XML stylesheet for President Entity – [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/president.xsl president.xsl]&lt;/SMALL&gt;'''

=== A look at the new elements: ===

* &amp;lt;xsl:key&amp;gt; This element is a necessary declaration in order to use the key() function described next. There are three necessary attributes to be used in this element:  
** &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This attribute contains the name to be referenced from within XSL file in the key() function. The value in the name attribute can be thought of in programmatic terms as a variable containing an instance of an object, such as: “String stringVariable” in Java. 
** &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;match&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This attribute is similar to the .&amp;lt;xsd:selector&amp;gt; element described above. This is the element in XML file containing the parent key (primary key of the relationship). 
** &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This attribute is similar to the &amp;lt;xsd:field&amp;gt; element describe above. This is the field containing the parent key value. 
  
* key(string,object) function: This function returns a node set based on the parameters passed to it. The &lt;i&gt;string &lt;/i&gt; parameter is the value defined in the &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; attribute in the &amp;lt;xsl:key&amp;gt; tag. The &lt;i&gt;object &lt;/i&gt; parameter is the value of primary key for which you wish to get the nodes for. key('predecessor',2) will return the nodes contained by the president element with attribute: primaryKey=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; . Since a node set is returned, you can access child nodes of the returned set with an x-path expression just as you would any element. So: &amp;lt;xsl:value-of select=&amp;quot;key('predecessor',2)/firstName &amp;quot;/&amp;gt; would output “John.” For more information on the key function visit: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#key
* &amp;lt;xsl:choose&amp;gt;  This XSL element provides a means for creating an if-else type structure in an XSL stylesheet. This is necessary in our example because the first President will not have a predecessor. We display the predecessor if only there is one! There are two elements within the &amp;lt;xsl:choose&amp;gt; element to perform this: 
** &amp;lt;xsl:when&amp;gt; This element is the equivalent to the programmatic 'if' statement. The &lt;i&gt;test&lt;/i&gt; attribute contains a test statement as described in chapter 5. In the above example, it is simply testing to see if the predecessor element is there (if a President has a predecessor). 
** &amp;lt;xsl:otherwise&amp;gt; This element is the equivalent to the programmatic 'else' statement. Its contents are displayed if the test condition in the &amp;lt;xsl:when&amp;gt; statement fails.

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;SMALL&gt;'''Table 6-4:  XML stylesheer for Team Entity – [http://www.opentourism.org/xmltext/team.xsl team.xsl]&lt;/SMALL&gt;'''

===A look at the new elements===

* &amp;lt;!doctype stylesheet[….]&amp;gt; - This declaration is necessary to declare an entity and must come before the &amp;lt;xsl:stylesheet&amp;gt; tag  
* &amp;lt;!ENTITY space &amp;quot;&amp;lt;xsl:text xmlns:xsl='http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform'&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; {2}- This decaration must come between the brackets “[]” in the doctype  declaration shown above. “space” is the name of the entity you are defining. The value in between the double quotes is what the the entity represents. In our example above, the entity &lt;i&gt;space &lt;/i&gt; is referring to a single whitespace, represented with the &amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt; statement. The &lt;i&gt;xmlns &lt;/i&gt; attribute located within the &amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; element is only necessary for parsers using the Microsoft XML parser, but should be included anyway for cross compliance. The syntax for using the entity is the same syntax for using any other entity in an XSL stylesheet, which is an ampersand (“&amp;amp;”) followed by the entity name and a semi-colon. In the example above, this would be &amp;amp;space; as shown on. Now whenever a space is needed in the style sheet “&amp;amp;space;” can be used instead of &amp;lt;xsl:text&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/xsl:text&amp;gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rosacea ([[w:IPA|IPA]]:{{IPA|ɹəʊ.ˈzeɪ.ʃə}}) is a common but often misunderstood condition that is estimated to affect over 45 million people worldwide. Most often, it begins as flushing and redness on the central face and across the cheeks, nose, or forehead but can also less commonly affect the neck, chest, scalp or ears. As rosacea progresses, other symptoms can develop such as permanent redness, red bumps (some with pus), red gritty eyes, burning and stinging sensations, small blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin, and in some advanced cases a bulbous nose. The disorder can be confused and co-exist with acne vulgaris and/or seborrheic dermatitis. People that are fair-skinned are disproportionately affected. Rosacea affects both men and women of all ages, but middle-aged women are more susceptible because of hot flushes caused by menopause.

===Subtypes and symptoms===
There are four identified rosacea subtypes&lt;ref name=&quot;JAmAcadDermatol2004-Wilkin&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wilkin J, Dahl M, Detmar M, Drake L, Liang MH, Odom R, Powell F | title=Standard grading system for rosacea: report of the National Rosacea Society Expert Committee on the classification and staging of rosacea | journal=J Am Acad Dermatol | year=2004 | pages=907-12 | volume=50 | issue=6 | id=PMID 15153893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patients may have more than one subtype present.

#''Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea:'' Permanent redness (erythema) with a tendency to flush and blush easily. It is also common to have small blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) and possibly burning or itching sensations.
#''Papulopustular rosacea:'' Some permanent redness with red bumps (papules) with some pus filled (pustules) (which typically last 1-4 days but sometimes as long as a month or more); this subtype can be easily confused with acne.
#''Phymatous rosacea:'' This subtype is most commonly associated with rhinophyma, an enlargenent of the nose. Symptoms include thickening skin, irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement. Phymatous rosacea can appear on the nose, chin, forehead, cheeks, and ears. Small blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) may be present.
#''Ocular rosacea:'' Red, dry and irritated eyes and eyelids. Some other symptoms include foreign body sensations, itching and burning.

Rosacea sufferers often report periods of depression stemming from cosmetic disfigurement, painful burning sensations, and decreases in quality of life.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ClinDermatol1984-Panconesi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Panconesi, E.| title=Psychosomatic dermatology | journal=Clin Dermatol | year=1984 | pages=94-179 | volume=2 | id=PMID 6242532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
The precise pathogenesis of rosacea still remains unknown, but most experts believe that rosacea is a disorder where the blood vessels become damaged when repeatedly dilated by stimuli. The damage causes the vessels to dilate too easily and stay dilated for longer periods of time or remain permanently dilated, resulting in flushing and redness. Immune cells and inflammatory mediators can leak from the microvascular bed causing inflammatory pustules and papules, especially with those with papulopustular rosacea.

Rosacea has a hereditary component and those that are fair-skinned of European or Celtic ancestry have a higher genetic predisposition to developing it. Women are more commonly affected but when men develop rosacea it tends to be more severe. People of all ages can get rosacea but there is a higher instance in the 30-50 age group. The first signs of rosacea are said to be persisting redness due to exercise, changes in temperature, and cleansing.

Triggers that cause episodes of flushing and blushing play a part in the development of rosacea. Exposure to temperature extremes can cause the face to become flushed as well as strenuous exercise, heat from sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, cold wind, moving to a warm or hot environment from a cold one such as heated shops and offices during the winter. There are also some foods and drinks that can trigger flushing, these include alcohol, foods high in histamine and spicy food.

Certain medications and topical irritants can quickly progress rosacea. If redness persists after using a treatment then it should be stopped immediately. Some acne and wrinkle treatments that have been reported to cause rosacea include microdermabrasion, chemical peels, high dosages of isotretinoin, benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin. ''Steroid induced rosacea'' is the term given to rosacea caused by the use of topical or nasal steroids. These steroids are often prescribed for seborrheic dermatitis. Dosage should be slowly decreased and not immediately stopped to avoid a flare up.

Studies of rosacea and demodex mites have revealed that some people with rosacea have increased numbers of the mite, especially those with steroid induced rosacea.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntJDermatol1998-Erbagcaronci&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Erbagcaronci Z, Özgöztascedili O | title=The significance of Demodex folliculorum density in rosacea | journal=Int J Dermatol. | month=June | year=1998 | pages=421-5 | volume=37 | issue=6 | id=PMID 9646125}}&lt;/ref&gt; When large numbers are present they may play a role along with other triggers.

It has also been suggested that rosacea might be a neurological disorder resulting from hypersensitization of sensory neurons following activation of the plasma kakllikrein-kinin system by exposure to intestinal bacteria in the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClinExpDermatol2004-KendallSN&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kendall SN | title=Remission of rosacea induced by reduction of gut transit time. | journal=Clin Exp dermatol. | month=May | year=2004 | pages=297-9 | volume=29 | issue=3 | id=PMID 15115515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
===Age===
There has never been a thorough study on the incidence of age and rosacea. The National Rosacea Society and their Canadian affiliate the Rosacea Awareness Program report in their 'Standard classification of rosacea' that &quot;Rosacea occurs in both men and women and, although it may occur at any age, the onset typically begins at any time after age 30&quot;. This statement is believed to be based on a large mail in survey which the results are summerised in ''Figure 1''. This can be compared to an Internet survey ''Figure 2'' that reported different results. Both surveys are considered to be inaccurate as both methods used to survey have inherent flaws and large bias.

One of the major defining characteristics of a nation, and, arguably, a world, is philosophy. Philosophy comes from many sources, but usually there are people looked up to as &quot;philosophers,&quot; or lovers of knowledge. There are few well-known modern-day philosophers, but some of the better known and recent ones include Mohandas Gandhi and Albert Einstein. However, you are not interested in the philosophers of this world-- you want to create your own philosophy. To do this, you must first understand how philosophy comes about.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soups|Soups]]

This is the basic recipe and method for Jewish Rosehip Soup. It is also popular in Iceland and parts of Scandinavia, where, because of the cold temperatures, it's often used for colds and sore throats. 

==Ingredients==  
* 1 [[Cookbook:L|litre]] fresh rosehips
* 2 [[Cookbook:L|litres]] [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* For each litre, 1 liquid quart of rosehip pulp
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] potato flour
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:almond|almonds]] 

==Method==
#Rinse the rosehips. Crush dried hips. Boil in water till soft.
#Press through a [[Cookbook:colander|colander]]. Measure the pulp and dilute with water if necessary. 
#Bring the pulp to a boil and add sugar. Add more sugar if it is too tart.
#Mix potato flour with some cold water. Thicken the soup while you stir and bring to a boil. Add blanched and shredded almond.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Hot soup is often served with vanilla ice cream and/or macaroons. 
*Cold soup can be diluted to make a nice thirst-quencher.
*The Icelandic recipe differs in that it contains less sugar (approx. 1 tbsp) and cornstarch is used to thicken it, not potato flour.

I am the [[Wiktionary:robot|'bot]] account under which all of [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]]'s automated and semi-automated editing tools run when major work is being performed.

It is intended that I will be flagged as a 'bot, as my edit load ''will'' flood recent changes.  However, that is not the case yet, and all of my edits are currently subject to the usual scrutiny of edits made by pseudonymous users.

For details of the tools used, see [[User:Uncle G's 'bot]].

== Tasks ==
This is what I do.
=== Renaming Cookbook talk pages ===
When the &lt;tt&gt;Cookbook:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace was created, the talk pages (&lt;tt&gt;Talk:Cookbook:X&lt;/tt&gt;) were not renamed (&lt;tt&gt;Cookbook talk:X&lt;/tt&gt;).  I have a list of the 525 cookbook talk pages that exist, and I am using WIKIMOVE.exe to rename all of them to the &lt;tt&gt;Cookbook talk:&lt;/tt&gt; namespace.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Uncle G's major work 'bot. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Uncle G's major work 'bot~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:assert}} is a Java [[Java Programming/Keywords|keyword]] used
to define an [[Java Programming/Statements/assert|''assert statement'']].
An assert statement is used to declare an expected boolean condition in a program.
If the program is running with assertions enabled, then the condition
is checked at runtime. If the condition is false, the Java runtime system
[[Java Programming/Statements/throw|throws]] a {{Java:api|java.lang|AssertionError}}.

Assertions may be declared using the following syntax:

{{XCode|1=&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
assert expression1 [: expression2];
&lt;/source&gt;}}

&lt;tt&gt;expression1&lt;/tt&gt; is a boolean that will throw the assertion if it is false.  When it is thrown, the assertion error exception is created with the parameter &lt;tt&gt;expression2&lt;/tt&gt; (if applicable). 

An example: 
{{XCode|1=&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
assert list != null &amp;&amp; list.size() &gt; 0 : &quot;list variable is null or empty&quot;;
Object value = list.get(0);
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Assertions are usually used as a debugging aid.  They should not be used instead of validating arguments to public methods, or in place of a more precise runtime error exception. 

Assertions are enabled with the Java &lt;code&gt;-ea&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-enableassertions&lt;/code&gt;
runtime option. See your Java environment documentation for additional options
for controlling assertions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The {{Java:if}} ... {{Java:else}} statement is used to conditionally execute one of two
statements, depending on the result of a boolean condition.

Example:

 {{Java:if}} (list == null) {
   {{Java://|this block of statements executes if the condition is true
 }
 {{Java:else}} {
   {{Java://|this block of statements executes if the condition is false
 }

An {{Java:if}} statement has two forms:

 {{Java:if}} ({{Java:boolean-condition}})
    {{Java:statement1}}

and

 {{Java:if}} ({{Java:boolean-condition}})
    {{Java:statement1}}
 {{Java:else}}
    {{Java:statement2}}

Use the second form if you have different statements to execute if the
{{Java:boolean-condition}} is true or if it is false.
Use the first if you only wish to execute {{Java:statement1}} if
the condition is true and you do not wish to execute alternate
statements if the condition is false.

The following example calls two {{Java:int}} methods, &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;, stores the results, then uses an {{Java:if}}
statement to test if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is less than y and if it is,
the {{Java:statement1}} body will swap the values. The end result is
x always contains the larger result and y always contains the smaller result.

 {{Java:int}} x = f();
 {{Java:int}} y = y();
 {{Java:if}} ( x &lt; y ) {
   {{Java:int}} z = x;
   x = y;
   y = z;
 }

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Java '''Literals''' are syntactic representations of boolean, character, numeric, or string data. Literals provide a means of expressing specific values in your program. For example, in the following statement, an integer variable named &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is declared and assigned an integer value. The literal &lt;code&gt;'''0'''&lt;/code&gt; represents, naturally enough, the value zero.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-61&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.61: Numeric literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int count = 0;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The [[#code-section-62|code section 3.62]] contains two number literals followed by two boolean literals at line 1, one string literal followed by one number literal at line 2, and one string literal followed by one real number literal at line 3:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-62&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.62: Literals.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
(2 &gt; 3) ? true : false;
&quot;text&quot;.substring(2);
System.out.println(&quot;Display a hard coded float: &quot; + 37.19f);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Boolean Literals ==
There are two boolean literals

* {{Java:true}} represents a true boolean value
* {{Java:false}} represents a false boolean value

There are no other boolean literals, because there are no other boolean values!

== Numeric Literals ==
There are three types of numeric literals in Java.
=== Integer Literals ===
In Java, you may enter integer numbers in several formats:

# As decimal numbers such as &lt;code&gt;1995&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;51966&lt;/code&gt;. Negative decimal numbers such as &lt;code&gt;-42&lt;/code&gt; are actually ''expressions'' consisting of the integer literal with the unary negation operation &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;.
# As octal numbers, using a leading &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (zero) digit and one or more additional octal digits (digits between &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;), such as &lt;code&gt;077&lt;/code&gt;. Octal numbers may evaluate to negative numbers; for example &lt;code&gt;037777777770&lt;code&gt; is actually the decimal value -8.
# As hexadecimal numbers, using the form &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;0X&lt;/code&gt;) followed by one or more hexadecimal digits (digits from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;). For example, 0xCAFEBABEL is the long integer 3405691582. Like octal numbers, hexadecimal literals may represent negative numbers.
# Starting in J2SE 7.0, as binary numbers, using the form &lt;code&gt;0b&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;0B&lt;/code&gt;) followed by one or more binary digits (0 or 1). For example, 0b101010 is the integer 42. Like octal and hex numbers, binary literals may represent negative numbers.

By default, the integer literal primitive type is {{Java:int}}. If you want a {{Java:long}}, add a letter ''el'' suffix (either the character &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; or the character &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;) to the integer literal. This suffix denotes a ''long integer'' rather than a standard integer. For example, &lt;code&gt;3405691582L&lt;/code&gt; is a long integer literal. Long integers are 8 bytes in length as opposed to the standard 4 bytes for {{Java:int}}. It is best practice to use the suffix &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; to avoid confusion with the digit &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (one) which looks like &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; in many fonts: &lt;code&gt;200l&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ne; &lt;code&gt;2001&lt;/code&gt;. If you want a short integer literal, you have to cast it.

Starting in J2SE 7.0, you may insert underscores between digits in a numeric literal. They are ignored but may help readability by allowing the programmer to group digits.

=== Floating Point Literals ===
Floating point numbers are expressed as decimal fractions or as exponential notation:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-63&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.63: Floating point literals.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double decimalNumber = 5.0;
decimalNumber = 5d;
decimalNumber = 0.5;
decimalNumber = 10f;
decimalNumber = 3.14159e0;
decimalNumber = 2.718281828459045D;
decimalNumber = 1.0e-6D;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Floating point numbers consist of:
# an optional leading &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; sign, indicating a positive or negative value; if omitted, the value is positive,
# one of the following number formats
#* ''integer digits'' (must be followed by either an exponent or a suffix or both, to distinguish it from an integer literal)
#* ''integer digits'' &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
#* ''integer digits'' &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; ''integer digits''
#* &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; ''integer digits''
# an optional exponent of the form
#* the exponent indicator &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;
#* an optional exponent sign &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (the default being a positive exponent)
#* ''integer digits'' representing the integer exponent value
# an optional floating point suffix:
#* either &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; indicating a single precision (4 bytes) floating point number, or
#* &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; indicating the number is a double precision floating point number (by default, thus the double precision (8 bytes) is default).

Here, ''integer digits'' represents one or more of the digits &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.

Starting in J2SE 7.0, you may insert underscores between digits in a numeric literal. They are ignored but may help readability by allowing the programmer to group digits.

=== Character Literals ===
Character literals are constant valued character expressions embedded in a Java program. Java characters are sixteen bit Unicode characters, ranging from 0 to 65535. Character literals are expressed in Java as a single quote, the character, and a closing single quote ({{Java:ch|a}}, {{Java:ch|7}}, {{Java:ch|$}}, {{Java:ch|π}}). Character literals have the type {{Java:char}}, an unsigned integer [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive type]]. Character literals may be safely promoted to larger integer types such as {{Java:int}} and {{Java:long}}. Character literals used where a {{Java:short}} or {{Java:byte}} is called for must be cast to {{Java:short}} or {{Java:byte}} since truncation may occur.

== String Literals ==
String literals consist of the double quote character (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) (ASCII 34, hex 0x22), zero or more characters (including Unicode characters), followed by a terminating double quote character (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), such as: {{Java:string|Ceci est une string.}}

So a string literal follows the following grammar:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;STRING :
        &quot;\&quot;&quot;
        (    (~[&quot;\&quot;&quot;,&quot;\\&quot;,&quot;\n&quot;,&quot;\r&quot;])
        |(&quot;\\&quot;
            ( [&quot;n&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;\\&quot;,&quot;'&quot;,&quot;\&quot;&quot;]
            |[&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;]([&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;])?
            |[&quot;0&quot;-&quot;3&quot;][&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;][&quot;0&quot;-&quot;7&quot;]
            )
        )
        )*
        &quot;\&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Within string and character literals, the backslash character can be used to escape special characters, such as [[Java Programming/Syntax/Unicode Escape Sequences|unicode escape sequences]], or the following special characters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
! Name
! Character
! ASCII
! hex
|-
| Backspace
| &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt;
| 8
| 0x08
|-
| TAB
| &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt;
| 9
| 0x09
|-
| NUL character
| &lt;code&gt;\0&lt;/code&gt;
| 0
| 0x00
|-
| newline
| &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;
| 10
| 0x0a
|-
| carriage control
| &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;
| 13
| 0xd
|-
| double quote
| &lt;code&gt;\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| 34
| 0x22
|-
| single quote
| &lt;code&gt;\'&lt;/code&gt;
| 39
| 0x27
|-
| backslash
| &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt;
| 92
| 0x5c
|}

String literals may not contain unescaped newline or linefeed characters. However, the Java compiler will evaluate compile time expressions, so the following String expression results in a string with three lines of text:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-64&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.64: Multi-line string.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String text = &quot;This is a String literal\n&quot;
            + &quot;which spans not one and not two\n&quot;
            + &quot;but three lines of text.\n&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== null ==
{{Java:null}} is a special Java literal which represents a ''null value'': a value which does not refer to any object. It is an error to attempt to dereference the null value &amp;mdash; Java will throw a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;. {{Java:null}} is often used to represent uninitialized state.

== Mixed Mode Operations ==
In concatenation operations, the values in brackets are concatenated first. Then the values are concatenated from the left to the right. Be careful when mixing character literals and integers in String concatenation operations:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-65&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.65: Concatenation operations.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
int one = '1';
int zero = '0';

System.out.println(&quot;120? &quot; + one + '2' + zero);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Console for Code section 3.66'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
120? 49248
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The unexpected results arise because {{Java:ch|1}} and {{Java:ch|0}} are converted twice. The expression is concatenated as such:
{| style=&quot;margin: auto; text-align: center;&quot;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;120? &quot; + one + '2' + zero&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;120? &quot; + '''49'''&lt;/u&gt; + '2' + '''48'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''&quot;120? 49&quot;''' + '2'&lt;/u&gt; + 48&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''&quot;120? 492&quot;''' + 48&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;'''&quot;120? 49248&quot;'''&lt;/code&gt;
|}

# &lt;code&gt;one&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; are integers. So they store integer values. The integer value of {{Java:ch|1}} is 49 and the integer value of {{Java:ch|0}} is 48.
# So the first concatenation concatenates {{Java:string|120? }} and &lt;code&gt;49&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;49&lt;/code&gt; is first converted into String, yielding {{Java:string|49}} and the concatenation returns the string {{Java:string|120? 49}}.
# The second concatenation concatenates {{Java:string|120? 49}} and {{Java:ch|2}}. {{Java:ch|2}} is converted into the String {{Java:string|2}} and the concatenation returns the string {{Java:string|120? 492}}.
# The concatenation between {{Java:string|120? 492}} and {{Java:ch|0}} returns the string {{Java:string|120? 49248}}.
The [[#code-section-66|code section 66]] yields the desired result:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-66&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.66: Correct primitive type.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
char one = '1';
char zero = '0';

System.out.println(&quot;120? &quot; + one + '2' + zero);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Console for Code section 3.66'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
120? 120
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

It is nearly midnight at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley]] home, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], crouched under his bed covers, is reading ''A History of Magic'' and writing a summer homework essay on witch burning. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] locked Harry's school trunk in the cupboard, and Harry had to pick the cupboard lock and steal his books, quill, parchment, and ink, in order to do his homework.

As usual, Harry celebrates his birthday alone. Other than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] botched phone call, which ended with Uncle Vernon hanging up on him, Harry has heard nothing from his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] friends all summer. As Harry prepares to go to sleep, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]] (the Weasley’s owl) arrive with presents. Ron sends Harry a Pocket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sneakoscope|Sneakoscope]] and a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']] article about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Ron’s father]] winning a contest. The Weasleys used the prize money for a trip to Egypt; the article's photo shows the entire Weasley family, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Ron's pet rat]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] wearing his new Head Boy badge. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], vacationing in France with her parents, sends Harry a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Broomstick]] Servicing Kit. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] gift is a strange book titled ''The Monster Book of Monsters''. It almost seems alive, nipping at Harry and nearly waking the Dursleys as it scrambles around the room before Harry subdues it.

Another owl delivers the usual Hogwarts' letter with instructions about classes, textbooks, and supplies. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] has included a permission form that a parent or guardian needs to sign, allowing students to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], the Wizarding village in which Hogwarts is located. Harry doubts he can persuade the Dursleys to sign it, but for now, he is happy that his birthday has been remembered by his friends.

== Analysis ==

Harry must endure yet another unhappy summer at the Dursleys. His confinement there only reinforces what little connection Harry retains to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle world]] and how he longs to return to Hogwarts, the only place he feels he truly belongs. Although Harry's first eleven years at the abusive Dursleys were unhappy, he survived relatively well, unaware then that he actually belonged somewhere else. Now, knowing that another world exists where he is happy, has friends, and is accepted for who and what he is, his confinement to Privet Drive is intolerable. He was prematurely liberated the previous year by Ron and the Twins, who rescued him in the flying car and took him to their home, but it seems unlikely Harry will be as fortunate this summer. He has not been totally shut off from the Wizarding realm, however. Reading ''A History of Magic'' is one means by which he remains connected. Also, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid have remembered him, sending gifts and letters. Ron's present, an inexpensive Sneakoscope, likely will play a significant role in the plot, as may the photograph of the Weasleys in Egypt. Hagrid's gift is also notable, though it seems more aligned to his own interests than Harry's. And while Harry is left confused as to why Hagrid sent such a &quot;ferocious&quot; gift, the &quot;Monster&quot; book, as well as Hermione's present, may also foreshadow upcoming plot elements.

Readers might notice a minor mistake in early editions of this book. The textbook that Harry is reading, ''A History of Magic'', is said to be by Adalbert Waffling. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we are told that ''A History of Magic'' is by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]. Adalbert Waffling is the author of ''Magical Theory'', according to Book 1. This mistake is pointed up by Bathilda's becoming a more important character in book 7. While it is possible, as in the Muggle world, that these are two separate books by different authors that just happen to have identical titles, and that ''Magical Theory'' is another book by Waffling, it seems in fact to be only a minor mistake, corrected in later editions.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The Weasley family photograph, though seemingly mundane and insignificant, is actually what spurs the majority of the book's action. When Harry's convicted godfather, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] sees the picture in the Daily Prophet, he recognizes Ron’s rat as being something other than a pet; this compels him to escape [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] prison, apparently intent on murdering Harry, but actually for another purpose.

Ron mentions that the Sneakoscope is cheap and probably faulty, it having gone off two times when he believes it should not have. Harry's thought that it had reacted to the Twins, and later Ron, behaving in an untrustworthy manner, leaves us wondering whether Ron's assessment is correct. It will go off twice more, and though the warnings are again disregarded, the Sneakoscope is, in every case, correctly signaling an untrustworthy person's nearby presence. 

Hermione's gift, a broomstick servicing kit, while unimportant to the plot, may represent just how significant Harry's brooms are to him, as well as foreshadowing a major subplot involving Harry's treasured Nimbus 2000 broom. When it is accidentally destroyed, he will receive an expensive replacement from an anonymous benefactor, only to have it confiscated by concerned Hogwarts staff, though it is eventually returned when it is declared to be safe. This cycle's effect of loss and recovery will be felt by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as well as the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and it could also be seen as a metaphor for Harry's own life.

Unknown to Harry just yet, Hagrid is the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher. ''The Monster Book of Monsters'' is his chosen &quot;set book&quot; (textbook), and he has partly selected it because he finds it humorous. The book can only be opened by stroking it, whereupon it purrs and relaxes. No one will be able to figure this out, and the entire class will have bound their textbooks with belts and ropes to prevent attacks. This is hardly surprising; the Flourish &amp; Blotts staff, who as booksellers should know such details about the books they sell, are equally unable to tame the vicious tomes and keep them securely caged.

=== Connections ===
* The Sneakoscope will appear twice more in this book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|once on the Hogwarts Express]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 11|again near Christmas]]. A different Sneakoscope will appear on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody's]] desk [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 20|in the fourth book]], and another, possibly Moody's, will appear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|the Room of Requirement]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 18|in the fifth book]]. The specific Sneakoscope that we see in this chapter will not be seen after this book until, old and broken, it is cleaned out of Harry's school trunk [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 2|in the final book]]. Hermione will give Harry a new Sneakoscope [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 7|for his birthday that year]], and it will be used multiple times during the Trio's travels through England in that book.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;They strive for a global theocracy and are not above using terrorism to achieve their ends.&quot;

I think that you should make up your mind here wether you are writing
a simple Islamic explanation page, or a POV page. If it is a POV page, then be honest about it and link to something to balance it.

I notice that you didn't mention
the same problem with Christians, who have killed and murdered far more people in the name of their religion than any other.
And who actually achieved a near global theocracy at the height
of the Roman Catholic Empire.

I'm not going to edit it, and to be truthful, I agree with you, but
that isn't the point. I think that having two pages, one to simply tell the &quot;Nuetral facts&quot; and one to then discuss the serious problems, is in order, and far more fair.

On the other hand, i could go find a dozen Islamic BBSes, post your
article, leave a link, and let you hear from them what they think about it...lol.
(Sorry, i wouldn't do that,)

Also, I think that it is very important, even whilst indicting 
Islam for its serious flaws, to make a distinction between those
who follow the faith ernestly, and those who are actually politicos,
using the faith as a way to manipulate the populations.
(And again, the same thing goes for christianity)
Islams Core tenets, just as Christianities core tenets, do have injunctions against war and violence.

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 03:33, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

* Hello Prometheuspan:
Yes, you make a good point. But I was referring to “Islamists,” not Muslims (this also covers your last point, I think) and referring to current, not past, behaviours. Christians, certainly, behaved just as badly (or even worse). But someone might like to edit the text to clarify this point. Thanks. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 22:00, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

P.S. See [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist#Islamist_movements| Islamism. 4.Islamist movements]] [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:07, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt; [[Portuguese/Contents|Contents]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Function==

The conditional mood in Portuguese is the equivalent of the &quot;would + infinitive&quot; construction in English. 

It is used to express a situation in which there are &quot;conditions&quot;.
For example:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''I would go''' to the party if you took me. &lt;br&gt;
''Eu iria à festa se você me levasse''

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The conditional is frequently used along with the imperfect subjunctive, as in the context above.
 
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''conditional + if + imp. subjunctive''' - Eu compraria um carro se tivesse dinheiro. 

'''If + imp. subjunctive + conditional''' - Se eu tivesse dinheiro, compraria um carro.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

It is also used with the verb gostar. For example:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE7AA&quot;&gt;
''' Eu gostaria de ir ao centro. ''' - ''I would like to go into town.'' 

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Also note that the first person plural contains an accent over the last &quot;i&quot;. 

'''''Gostaríamos''''' ''de ir ao centro se você chegasse também.''

==Formation==

In regular verbs, the conditional is formed by adding these never-changing endings to the infinitive.

'''FALAR - to speak'''
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot;
 border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;I would speak&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eu falar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (s,inf) would speak&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Tu falar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ias&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;He would speak&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;i&gt;also ela, voc&amp;ecirc;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;íamos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (p) would speak&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;V&amp;oacute;s falar&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;íeis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They would speak&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;

&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;iam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

#Mastermind 007 11:32, 4 February 2006 (UTC) --- This book definitely contains all the content needed to face the difficulties and suggestions in your life. An excellent try by [[User:Vikram Vaka|Vikram Vaka]] for this book. Keep it up.

* I have some doubts. In my opinion the book is still not finished. And chapter titles are somewhat misleading: they look like they belonged to book &quot;Guide to Growning Up&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:14, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

* I still think this book requires lots of polishing. Some chapters are way too short and do not tell enough, and there are some uncompleted parts. [Lycaphim 2/8/06]

* The quality of most of its material is, unfortunately, quite low.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:42, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

#[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:18, 3 February 2006 (UTC) I just discovered this neat little gem of a book that has been developed as a class project for a Mechanical Engineer class.

* Quite nice, but I think that Book of the Month should be more polished. There's a cleanup message on the book's main page, many images lack license and there is no print version ready. That's why I will wait before I vote for it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:04, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

*If we are going to use the Book of the Month to show off a sampling of the best of Wikibooks, I think this ought to be something that simply must be in the list of the best items ever developed on Wikibooks.  Almost a project unto itself, it is certainly worthy of congratulations and deserves feature status on the front page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:58, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

*This would be a classically good book for collaboration.  It is a subject of which many people have knowledge, it is a basic subject on which we should have a top-quality text, and it isn't just some stub hoping to be a book some day.  It also has the advantage that it isn't being simultaneously nominated as Book of the Month, which situation I never understand.  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 13:50, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The balance of a watch needs thin delicate pivots and fragile jewels to run well.  The balance is generally one of the largest and heaviest jewelled wheels in the watch, and thus one of the most likely to be damaged if the watch is dropped or bumped.  

==Shock Springs==
Modern shock protection began commercially with the introduction of the [[wikipedia:Incabloc]] system in the 1930s, although not widely used until the 50's.  
{|
|[[Image:321 balance a.jpg|thumb|upright|Incablock balance spring]]
|[[image:BwcSeikoDiashock.jpg|thumb|upright|Seiko Diashock spring]]
|}

In this system the balance jewels are spring-mounted, and the balance staff is specifically shaped.  In the event of a shock, the balance can push the jewels out of position temporarily.  If the shock is severe, a thicker and stronger portion of the balance staff will contact a strong part of the jewel setting before the jewel reaches the end of its travel.  After the shock, the springs force the jewels back to their proper place.    The same basic system is also used by Kif, Seiko's Diashock and Citizen's Parashock.   


==Other systems==
Wyler had the Incaflex system as an alternative to shock springs.  In this system, the rim of the balance is connected to the staff with springy spiral arms.  
{|
| [[Image:Incaflex2.jpg|thumb|right|Wyler Incaflex balance in movement]]
| [[Image:Incaflex1.jpg|thumb|left|Wyler Incaflex balance wheel]]
|}

Under a shock, the heavy rim of the balance would displace and contact a rim around the circumference before enough force was applied to damage the staff or jewels.  (Note the cap jewel with no shock spring)  

Timex used the V-Conic system.  Instead of the traditional arrangement of slender pivots, Timex used a conical profile.  Instead of jewel bearings, they used metal cups shaped to match the V-conic pivots.  This system was both less expensive to manufacture, but also inherently stronger than traditional pivots, allowing Timex to meet shock-resistance standards with no springs.  

==Other wheel springs==
Sometimes you may see what appear to be shock springs on other wheels--These are actually retaining springs rather than shock springs, to allow the cap jewels to be more easily removed for cleaning.  Seiko calls their version Diafix rather than Diashock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:16-hole chrom 10-hole diatonic.jpg|right|thumb|A Chromatic and Diatonic harmonica]]
The '''harmonica''' is a free reed wood-wind instrument. Harmonicas have an incredibly rich range of expression, are easy to pick up, since there's no need for fingerings, etc. They play numerous &quot;intervals&quot; (two or more notes), which is difficult or impossible for many other wind instruments. It also works very well in the modern musical setting, where one needs to play most music through an amplifier or loudspeaker. A harmonica player can easily adapt to this by cupping a microphone and his or her harmonica in the hands, without sacrificing any other aspect of playing.

Harmonicas are extremely important for Blues music - in order to acquire its unique, soulful sound, a harmonica is needed. Harmonicas cross many genres - the diatonic harmonica is frequently used for rock, country, folk music and Irish jigs; and the chromatic harmonica is often associated with Jazz music, and more recently, Classical music. The tremolo harmonica is often used for Japanese folk songs.

The harmonica is also a very portable instrument. They can fit easily into any reasonably sized jacket pocket, which is very rare for all instruments.

Furthermore, learning the harmonica can improve your breathing, and thus, your health. The constant breathing into and out of a harmonica is substantial exercise for the diaphragm, which is why harmonicas are sometimes used to improve breathing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The blues genre of music originated in the USA in the 19th century and was a form of music developed by African-Americans. It is described as a soulful and emotional music whose themes are primarily about the lives, loves, hardships and hopes of African-Americans. 

Slowly the blues spread into urban areas which was mainly due to the fact that many rural blues musicians were leaving the countryside to find work in the factories of major cities. By 1920, three major formats of blues were common: The 8 bar blues, the 12 bar blues and the 16 bar blues. Blues also developed various styles, or subgenres, such as Mississippi Delta blues and Chicago electric blues.

==Blues scale==

Blues leads are played relying heavily on the notes of a minor pentatonic scale.  The minor pentatonic scale played over major chords creates the baseline for the dissonances that drive blues to a resolution.  The flatted seventh degree of the minor pentatonic lines up with the flatted seventh in the V7/IV chord which ties the chord progression and the leads together.  

Since the chord progression being played are mostly made up of major chords though, degrees from the major scale may also be included when playing blues leads.  The major third and major sixth are often added to the minor pentatonic scale to further tie the leads and chords together.  

The major third is most often played in blues immediately after the minor third and it often precedes either a resolution to the tonic of the scale or a jump up to the fifth degree.  

The major sixth is most often played immediately after the fifth degree of the scale and often precedes a resolution to the tonic of the scale or a jump to the minor third.  The tritone jump from major sixth to minor third is commonly played over the IV chord because it outlines the dominant seventh chord played based on that degree of the scale (V7/VII).  

The second and minor sixth degrees of the scale may only be played in a context where they are part of a chromatic run at least three notes long, for example: the motion from second - minor third - major third, or the motion from fifth - minor sixth - major sixth.  

Another common note present in the blues scale is the flatted fifth or tritone of the tonic of the scale.  The most common idea of a blues scale, and the quickest and easiest to pick up consists of a minor pentatonic scale with the added flatted fifth because use of the flatted fifth does not depend heavily on context and may be relied upon almost as frequently as any of the other notes in the pentatonic scale.  

The real blues scale includes all the chromatic notes between octaves except for the major seventh and minor second in the following order of commonality of use: tonic, minor third, perfect fifth, minor seventh, perfect fourth, major third, tritone, major sixth, minor sixth, major second.  

==Blues Chords==

Blues chord progressions are often made up by major chords and dominant seventh chords.  In 12 bar blues (explained later), the chord progression follows the most common underlying driving chord progression in western music moving from the tonic (I) to the sub-dominant (IV) to the dominant (V) back to the tonic (I).  In blues, the first tonic is often played as a dominant seventh chord written as the V7/IV.  This dominant seventh chord departs from the basic major scale by flatting the seventh degree, but it also creates a dissonance which resolves very nicely to the IV chord.  The IV chord then resolves up to the V chord weakly which is often played as a V7 chord, crating a dissonance which resolves to the I chord.  

The most common chord progression played in blues is the 12 bar blues pattern which follows this general outline:

  I |  I | I | I
 IV | IV | I | I
  V | IV | I | I

This pattern is heavily based on jazz progression and was mainly adopted to create some sense of uniformity among blues songs.  In early blues, the verses were not locked in to twelve bars and the only common line between songs was that it tonally moved from the tonic (I) to sub-dominant (IV) to dominant (V) back to tonic (I).  The usual chords to meet these purposes weren't even set, for example the dominant was occasionally played as a III chord rooted on the minor third, or just by hitting the minor third and fifth together to create some semblance of resolution when the 1 chord was returned to.  Blues verses could range anywhere from around seven bars in length to fifteen.  When record companies began to discover blues musicians, they realized this looseness of playing made blues songs less marketable and made it more difficult to bring many blues musicians together to play with each other, so they urged blues musicians to record their songs in uniform sets of twelve bars like jazz musicians did.  

The 12 bar blues progression is essentially a more complicated version of a I IV V progression.  If you simplify the bars into sets of two by the strong chords in the set, you can begin to see how this tonally makes sense: (I I)(I), (I I)(I), (IV IV)(IV), (I I)(I), (V IV)(V), (I I)(V).  The 12 bar blues can be further simplified into three sections the first being the tonic section with four bars of the tonic (I I I I)(I), the second being the sub-dominant section with two bars of the sub-dominant and two bars of the tonic (IV IV I I)(IV), and the third being the dominant section with a bar of the dominant, a bar of the sub-dominant, and two bars of the tonic (V IV I I)(V).  The presence of the two bars of tonic in the sub-dominant section doesn't change the tonal feel of the section, but gives it a feeling of motion and interest, just as the presence of the sub-dominant and tonic in the dominant section do.  The V IV I return to I also creates a more powerful resolution because the most powerful motions in music are the V - I relationship, and scalar movement.  The V to IV creates scalar motion without losing the dominant feel of the first chord then resolves to the I in the same direction of the scalar motion.  Since the dominant feel has not been lost, the resolution still feels like it is moving straight from from V to I.  Any twelve bar blues song can be played in a simplified version by playing the chord progression:  

  I |  I |  I |  I
 IV | IV | IV | IV
  V |  V |  I |  I

Another common practice in blues is to play the entire song over a single chord, for example, listen to catfish blues, first recorded by Skip James, or I'm a Man by Bo Diddly.  The song is often driven by a single riff that adds interest and a backbone behind the lyrics.  This practice doesn't warrant too much explanation due to its simplicity.

==Common Blues Elements==

One of the most recognizable blues riffs is the Mannish Boy riff.  This riff is commonly played over a single chord song and creates space between the lines.  It can also be heard in Hoochie Coochie Man, and George Thourogood's Bad to The Bone.  It is most commonly played in the key of G because in this key it can be played easily on all Bb brass instruments, harmonica, slide guitar in both standard tuning, and open G, piano, and bass.  The riff is played: G A G Bb G.  

Another common blues practice, especially on electric guitar is the shift from a power chord to the interval on the major sixth and back.  This rhythm switching back and forth serves as the backbone of most electric blues and early rock.  Over twelve bar blues, this rhythm would be played

{|

|}

Finally, the turnaround is a common element of almost every blues song.  The turnaround is how blues musicians make transition from the dominant section back to the tonic more interesting.  The most simple turnaround is just hitting the V chord at the end of the dominant section again instead of just sitting on the I.  The basic concept of most turnarounds is the chromatic run from the minor seventh to the fifth.  Many blues musicians abandon the harmonic root of this practice and just play either the notes alone, or some chord containing the minor seventh and chromatically move the chord down four half steps.  The chord progression that gave rise to this practice though is V7/IV -&gt; Idim -&gt; IVadd9 -&gt;  IIm7b5 -&gt; I.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of blues usually takes the form of a narrative. Most blues lyrics deal with personal woes and hard times, or simply day to day life. Blues lyrics rely on the idea that simple and understandable is easier for an audience to relate to than the eloquent and sometimes obscure lyrics in other popular genres of music.  Many blues songs also deal with the topics of personal pride, defiance, or powerful emotions other than woe such as love or anger.  While blues lyrics seldom turn to extremely happy topics, they are often uplifting, empowering, or humorous.  It cannot be said that blues is a 'sad' genre.  The blues are a way of dealing with sorrow, rather than wallowing in it.  

There are a few main structures of blues lyrics.  

Most commonly, a verse over one repetition of a I IV V or twelve bar blues progression consists of two distinct rhyming lines.  The first line is repeated twice, first over the tonic section and second over the sub-dominant section.  The second line is sung over the dominant section and often sums up the emotion of the first line.  A good example of this structure lies in How Many More Years, in which Howlin' Wolf sings:

I   &quot;How many more years, do I have to let you dog me around,
IV  How many more years, do I have to let you dog me around,
V   I'd rather be dead, lyin' six feet underground&quot;

A second common structure for blues lyrics contains a refrain and a few lines that change in every verse.  The progression is played with extra-long measures to accommodate the words.  The variable lyrics are sung over the tonic section and the refrain is sung over the sub-dominant and dominant sections.  The variable section of lyrics often rhymes with itself and the refrain rhymes with itself, but the rhyme schemes don't carry over between each other.  A good example of this structure is the verses of Muddy Waters' song, Can't be Satisfied, in which he sings:

I   &quot;Well I'm goin' away to leave, won't be back no more
I   Goin' back down south, child, don't you want to go?
IV  Woman I'm troubled, 
I   I be all worried in mind
V   Well baby I just can't be satisfied
I   And I just can't keep from cryin'&quot;

A final common structure for blues lyrics is a single line that repeats twice.  The first repetition of the line is sung over the tonic chord, and the second is split into two halves, covering the sub-dominant and the dominant chords.  A good example of this structure is Robert Johnson's Walking Blues, where he sings: 

I   &quot;Woke up this morning, looked 'round for my shoes
I   You know I had those mean old walking blues
IV  Woke up this morning,
I   Looked round for my shoes
V   You know I had those
I   Mean old walking blues&quot;

Welcome to the '''XML Schema''' book. It describes the structure of an XML Schema and explains how XML Schemas are used to validate XML documents.
{{Editor note|This book is designed as a reusable [[w:Learning Object|Learning Object]] and must take into consideration the constraints of many learning environments.  Please think carefully about adding material that would not allow the course to be reused by a broad variety of audiences and thus the course should be kept as modular as possible. These materials are designed to be implementation technology neutral so the course can be integrated into open source learning management systems such as Moodle.  For example, please do not put examples that depend on either using Java or Microsoft .Net. Computer language and operating system-specific issues such as Java, Microsoft, Mac, GNU/Linux and Windows dependencies should be isolated into separate labs that can be optimally included by instructors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
All the examples should use [[w:IEC_11179|ISO/IEC 11179]] three-part [[w:CamelCase|UpperCamelCase]] notation (ObjectPropertyTerm). This is designed to be consistent with [[w:ebXML|ebXML]] and [[w:NIEM|NIEM]] standards. See [[w:Data Element Name|Data Element Name]] and [[w:Representation term|Representation term]] for more information.
}}

==Prerequisites==
{{wikipedia|XML Schema (W3C)}}
{{TOC right}}
Students reading this book should already be familiar with the fundamental principles of [[XML]] and have some background on [[w:Data Type|Data Types]].

==Course Guidelines==
Only the [[#The prefix|The prefix]], [[#The root element: &lt;xs:schema&gt;|The root element: &lt;xs:schema&gt;]] and [[#Elements|Elements]] sections are required to build XML Schemas. [[#History of the XML Schema|History of the XML Schema]], [[#What are XML Schemas used For?|What are XML Schemas used For?]], [[#When XML Schema become inefficient at validating complex rules|When XML Schema become inefficient at validating complex rules]] and [[#XML Schema Example|XML Schema Example]] can be skipped and the sections following the [[#Elements|Elements]] section are additional information starting from the most important ones.

==History of the XML Schema==
'''XML Schema''' is a standard created by the world wide web consortium [http://www.w3c.org http://www.w3c.org]. Unlike DTDs, XML Schema uses XML file formats to define the XML Schema itself. Once you learn the structure of an XML file, you don't have to learn another syntax.

==What are XML Schemas used For?==

XML Schemas are primarily used to validate the structure and data types of an XML document. By structure we mean that an XML Schema defines:

# what data elements are expected
# what order the data elements are expected in
# what nesting these data elements have
# what data elements are optional and what data elements are required

XML Schemas can also be used by XML data mapping tools for quickly extracting data from databases and transferring them in XML files.

One of the best analogies is the blueprint analogy. Just like there are architectural blueprints that describe the structural design of a house, an XML Schema provides the &quot;structural design&quot; of a file.

==When XML Schema become inefficient at validating complex rules==
Although XML Schemas are excellent at sequential validation of data elements and data types, XML Schema tend to be cumbersome at expressing highly complex business rules. For example when you are at the end of a large file it is difficult to state a rule that checks if a data element has some value that another data element at the beginning of the file should have had another values. This can be done by using XML transforms and XPath expressions.

==XML Schema Example==
Here is a full example of a complete XML Schema file of personal contacts.

&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

==Structure of an XML Schema Document==
Like any other XML file, XML Schema files normally begin with an XML declaration (&lt;code&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which is followed by a root element (always &lt;code&gt;xs:schema&lt;/code&gt;).

===The prefix===
Although any prefix can be used to refer to the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, the most common convention is to use &quot;xs&quot;. Some people prefer &quot;xsd&quot;; some prefer to use the default namespace (which means no prefix is necessary). All XML Schema elements are in this namespace.

===The root element: &lt;xs:schema&gt;===
All XML Schema files must begin and end with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:schema&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
  targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
  xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
  elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
    ...other structure here...
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
    ...any elements here...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}
The schema MUST end with an &lt;code&gt;&lt;/xs:schema&gt;&lt;/code&gt; end markup.

An XML Schema defines elements and attributes which are available in a namespace (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/contactExample&lt;/nowiki&gt;). In the XML Schema, this namespace is defined using the &lt;code&gt;targetNamespace&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

In an XML file, a namespace can be imported using the &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; attribute (&lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; stands for '''XML''' '''N'''ame'''S'''pace). The &lt;code&gt;xmlns&lt;/code&gt; attribute name can be ended with &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and a prefix (i.e. &lt;code&gt;xs&lt;/code&gt;). In this case, the imported tags must be used with this prefix. Prefix are used to distinguish tags with same names imported from different namespaces.

You can see that the target namespace we are defining in the example is one of the namespace imported in the XML file. You can see that we are importing the namespace of the document itself with the &lt;code&gt;tns&lt;/code&gt; prefix, so that elements we are defining in the document can be used in the document itself starting with &lt;code&gt;tns:&lt;/code&gt; .

&lt;xs:sequence&gt; is used for ordered group of elements for unordered group of elements use &lt;xs:all&gt;.

===Elements===
Elements are defined in XML Schema using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd &quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

=== Elements with text body ===
For elements with text body, the type of the text can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attribute:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example

...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;ex:PersonGivenName&gt;Sue&lt;/ex:PersonGivenName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName&gt;Smith&lt;/ex:PersonFamilyName&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;
|-

...
   &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; type=&quot;xs:date&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
   &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate&gt;1990-09-23&lt;/ex:PersonBirthDate&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-

Some schema restrictions and facets can be defined to the data type using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:simpleType/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:restriction/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markups. For instance, a body text of string type can be fixed to a length of 5 characters using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:length/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup as above:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:white&quot;| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:simpleType&gt;
       &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xs:length value=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
     &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
   &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:PersonGivenName&gt;Kevin&lt;/ex:PersonGivenName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:PersonGivenName&gt;Helen&lt;/ex:PersonGivenName&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Here are all the schema restrictions and facets that can be used:

===Complex element===
Any element type that can have sub-elements and/or attributes is considered as a complex element. Complex element types are defined using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:complexType/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.

==== Sub-elements of a complex element ====
Sub-elements are defined with different apparition rules.

Sub-elements can be defined into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:all/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup: the sub-elements must all exist and can appear in any order.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;

           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:all&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Sub-elements can be defined into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup: the sub-elements must appear in the same order.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;

    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Sub-elements can be defined into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup: one and only one sub-element must appear.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;

...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Some apparition rules can be included into others apparition rules. &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup and &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup can be included into a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup or a &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.

&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Number of occurrences can be changed with the &lt;code&gt;minOccurs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maxOccurs&lt;/code&gt; attributes of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; minOccurs=&quot;0&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; minOccurs=&quot;3&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;/&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; minOccurs=&quot;2&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

By default, the minimum occurrence is 1 and the maximum occurrence is 1. To define an infinite number of occurrence, specify &lt;code&gt;unbounded&lt;/code&gt;.

===== Complex element with sub-elements and text =====
Complex elements can contain text in their body before, between and after their sub-elements setting the &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType mixed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    You can add text before,
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName /&gt;
    between,
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName /&gt;
    and after the sub-elements.
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

By default, the &lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Attributes of a complex element ====
The attributes of an element can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:attribute/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;relation&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;ex:Person relation=&quot;a colleague&quot;/&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

If the element contains both attributes and sub-elements, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:attribute/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markups must be defined above the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:all/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:sequence/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:choice/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup. Data types, restrictions and facets can be defined for attributes as it is for text-body-only elements.

By default, attributes are optional. This can be changed with the &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
* If its value is &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt;, the attribute can be left.
* If its value is &lt;code&gt;required&lt;/code&gt;, the attribute must be present.

A default value can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; attribute. If the attribute is not present, the parsers will consider the attribute is present and its value is the default value.

The attribute can be restricted to a constant value with the &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute. As the &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; attribute also acts as a default value, you must not define a &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; attribute too.

===== Complex element with attributes and text body =====
Elements can contain both attributes and text body using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:simpleContent/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup (remember that a simple type element can't contain attributes).

    1864
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

=== Type definition ===
Simple and complex types can be defined beside the element tree. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup has no body, keeps its &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute and has a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; attribute. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:complexType/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup is then defined outside the root element with a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute containing the element type name. There is no change for the XML file validation. Let's take this XML Schema:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;LastUpdate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xs:simpleType&gt;
          &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:date&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xs:minExclusive value=&quot;2003-05-06&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
        &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
      &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd&quot;
    LastUpdate=&quot;2003-05-07&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Now let's define Person complex type and the LastUpdate simple type beside the root element tree:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;PersonType&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;

  &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;LastUpdateType&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:date&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:minExclusive value=&quot;2003-05-06&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot; type=&quot;PersonType&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;LastUpdate&quot; type=&quot;LastUpdateType&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd&quot;
    LastUpdate=&quot;2003-05-07&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Complex and simple types can be defined in any order. A defined type can be reused in different elements of the schema and then its description is not duplicated. It avoids the XSD file to be too much indented. Moreever, using type definitions, the elements have not only a name but also a type name which can be used as a class name too. Some tools used to parse XML content according to an XML Schema can require a type name for complex type elements.

=== Element and attribute reference ===
Elements and attributes can be reused using references. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:element/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup or &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:attribute/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup has no body, no &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute and has a &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute. This &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; attribute contains the name of another element or another attribute. Let's use a reference on the Person element on the previous example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

  &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;LastUpdateType&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:date&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:minExclusive value=&quot;2003-05-06&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element ref=&quot;Person&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;LastUpdate&quot; type=&quot;LastUpdateType&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd&quot;
    LastUpdate=&quot;2003-05-07&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ex:Person&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

The difference between separate type definition above and using reference is that any element or attribute can be referenced. Moreever, using reference, links are done using names instead of type names. This means the we are not linking classes but instances of classes.

=== Extension ===
Defined complex types can be reused adding sub-elements or attributes. The complex type is then extended. It can be done using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:complexContent/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:extension/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markups. The extended type name is defined in the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;xs:extension/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; markup. Here is an example where the &lt;code&gt;PersonType&lt;/code&gt; complex type is extended with the &lt;code&gt;professional&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; element:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width:12em&quot; | XML Schema file !! A compliant XML file example

    targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&gt;

  &lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;PersonType&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonFamilyName&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;xs:element name=&quot;PersonBirthDate&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;

  &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Contacts&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:complexContent&gt;
              &lt;xs:extension base=&quot;PersonType&quot;&gt;
                &lt;xs:attribute name=&quot;professional&quot; type=&quot;xs:boolean&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;/xs:extension&gt;
            &lt;/xs:complexContent&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ex:Contacts xmlns:ex=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample&quot;
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.example.org/contactExample contactExample.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ex:Person professional=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonGivenName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonFamilyName/&gt;
    &lt;ex:PersonBirthDate/&gt;
  &lt;/ex:Person&gt;
&lt;/ex:Contacts&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|}

Various elements with common and different sub-elements or attributes can be defined like that. The common items would be defined in a common complex type and the different items would be defined in different complex types extending the first one.

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== [[XForms]] and [[XRX]] ==

I just wanted to let you know that I've been watching some of your edits recently (I watch the entire live RC feed) and you're doing some really great work on these two books. 

Also, the [[XForms]] book was voted to become a featured book a while back, so I've taken the liberty of putting the appropriate template onto the book. I hope you don't mind, but it's a nice little reminder of what a good condition that book is in. Keep up the good work! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:15, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:It's no problem, when I see good work, I like to acknowledge it. 
:Hit counting is something that we've been pursuing through the technical channels, but unfortunately it's difficult to do. We had a simple counter set up at one point, but the server for that has been down for some time. Digging back through my logs (and I have to go back to about October to get any data at all), it appears that the [[XForms]] book is getting about 300 page hits per day, total. Unfortunately, I can't break that number up by individual chapters. If I had to make a guess, I would assume that many of the page hits from readers (and the 300 number would include page hits from you and other editors) are probably centralized in the beginning chapters. Sorry I can't be more helpful in this. We are working to get a better page counter set up, but progress is slow. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:20, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Google Analytics ==

We tried Google Analytics before. However, the WMF has a privacy policy that prevents us from sharing personal tracking information with third parties. This means that we cannot install Google Analytics here on our website. There was an attempt for us to have users install the Analytics for themselves, but not enough users subscribed to it to make it worthwhile. 

A big problem with page counting is that the website is aggressively cached so we can't record hits on the database servers themselves, but the volume at the caches is huge (because WP, WB, and all the other WMF websites go though the same caches). They are working on solutions, but they are far from being available. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:42, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Screenshots ==

Hi Dan,

A quick note on your screenshots. As they are derivative works of the software they depict, they must be licensed accordingly. I updated your latest image upload license. Could you please go through your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?limit=50&amp;tagfilter=&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Dmccreary&amp;namespace=6&amp;year=&amp;month=-1 uploads] and ensure that these are properly tagged. Free license software needs compatible licensing (and should be uploaded to [[Commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] if they can be of use outside Wikibooks). Non-free may be kept in accordance with [[Wikibooks:Media]], but require a fair-use statement. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:08, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:Hello Swift.  Thank you for looking at the licenses for the images.  I apologize that I do not understand your note.  Since I create the images from my own forms I did not think they were derivative works.  I am the creator of both the form and the image.  They go together.  Neither is created by anyone else.  Perhaps I misunderstand the term &quot;derivative work&quot;.  I thought it implied that I took the work from some other area.  I also create all the forms specifically for this book.  Others are fee to put them in the commons area but I do want them to give attribution to the original authors.  My understanding is that the licenses should all be consistent with the wikibooks (Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0).  I have worked hard to make sure that all images are in fact Creative Commons with Attribution but I know that sometimes I don't select the right selection dropdown list.  Is there some way to generate a report of all the images to make sure that they in fact Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0?  Do you have any documents that I should read to help create precise guidelines for the authors?  --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 12:18, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

:: The images must be licensed identically to the software and an indication should be made that they are screenshots, that you did not create the image, but rather that it is a visual representation of software. Swift added &lt;nowiki&gt;{{free screenshot|license=BSD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the image he refers to in order to indicate this. I couldn't find what license XForms uses to know if a BSD license is correct, but it would be similar for GPL or LGPL software. See [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files#Screenshots]] for more information. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:37, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

::: Hello Adrignola.  Just to clarify, XForms is not a software package but a [[W3C|World Wide Web]] standard, just like HTML or CSS.  This is a book about the standard, not a specific software package.  There are many tools use to transform the forms into HTML and CSS.    [http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms See W3C Specification] I am still trying to figure out how to license the screen images and I very much want to conform to the guidelines in the Wikibooks.  This is really complicated!  --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 13:46, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: Ah, well no wonder I couldn't find licensing information.  Maybe you'd also want to consider {{tlx|PD-ineligible}}, though that would sacrifice attribution.  Personally, I'm fine with the licensing you've put on the images (Creative Commons). -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:00, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

::::: Yes really don't want to sacrifice attribution.  We want to give our authors as much credit as we can to encourage them to contribute more.  If you are OK then I am OK.  I will wait to see if Swift has any other suggestions.  Thanks Bunches! --[[User:Dmccreary|Dmccreary]] ([[User talk:Dmccreary|talk]]) 15:38, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Disp==
Disp ''variable or expression''
e.g. :Disp &quot;HELLO!&quot;

Displays on screen and scrolls down. Numbers right, strings left.
To make a blank line, type :Disp &quot;&quot;

There can be multiple expressions or variables with each having its own line

 :Disp &quot;HELLO&quot;,&quot;WORLD!&quot;

If no arguments are added, the Home screen is displayed.

==Pause==
 Pause ''variable or expression''
e.g.
 :Pause &quot;Press the right arrow key to see the rest of this sentence.&quot;

Displays on screen and scrolls down. Numbers right, strings left. If item is longer than 16 widths, user can scroll.

== Text() ==
Text(y,x,Var) or Text(y,x,Str) or Text(y,x,Str,Var)

e.g. 
&lt;pre&gt;
:Text(1,1,A) or :Text(1,1,&quot;HELLO&quot;) or :Text(1,1,&quot;VALUE IS&quot;,A)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This command displays text or variables like all the other commands, though it displays text on the draw screen, using a slightly more space efficient font size. &lt;br&gt;*Notice that this command inverts the x and y coordinates when displaying text and that it starts from the upper left 1,1 coordinate.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Text(-1,1,1,A)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This command writes the text as big as it would be written on the HomeScreen.

==Output==
Output(''x'',''y'',''expr'')
e.g. :Output(1,1,&quot;HELLO!&quot;)
This displays text starting on that square, and wraps to next line. If it is the 8th/last line, subsequent text is ignored. If it is the last command in the program, &quot;Done&quot; is prevented from displaying.
Therefore, it is useful to end a program:
&lt;pre&gt;
...
:''commands''
:''commands''
:Lbl Q:''closing commands'':'''Output(1,1,&quot;&quot;)'''
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes how to get out of problems when programs go wrong. The most common way is by killing the process - an individual program or one of its parts. If you kill a process, you'll probably lose any unsaved data in that program, and possibly from other programs it has spawned or is communicating with..

This page also describes what to do if the computer is completely frozen.

These suggestions have more adverse consequences the further down the list you go. For example killing a window in KDE will lose the unsaved data in that program, whereas pressing the reset button could corrupt all data on a hard drive (in extreme cases). Don't resort to extreme measures unless you have no other choice.

== On the Desktop ==

=== In X-Window (general) ===

The default easy-to-use application for killing frozen pieces of software when using an X environment is '''xkill'''. When executed, the mouse cursor will change to an icon of a skull and crossbones, and the next window you click will be killed.
  xkill

Sometimes this can be done by doing Control+Alt+Escape, or alternatively by bringing up the &quot;Run&quot; dialog box with ALT+F2 and typing in &quot;xkill&quot; followed by RETURN.

=== In KDE ===

[http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdebase/ksysguard/usingtheksysguard.html KDE System Guard] (installed by default) can be used to kill troublesome processes. '''Ctrl+Esc''' is the default key combination for starting it, or run ''ksysguard''.

=== In GNOME ===

The '''gnome-system-monitor''' GUI program is one way to view active processes, end processes, and kill them too. There is also a &quot;Force Quit&quot; widget which can be added to a panel which replicates the function of '''xkill'''.

== Killing at the Console ==

The easiest way of stopping a program running on the terminal you are using is pressing '''Ctrl+C''', which asks a program to stop (sends [[w:SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]]) - but the program can ignore this. Ctrl+C also works on programs like XTerm or Konsole. See also [[#Alt+SysRq|Alt+SysRq+K]] below.

In addition, there are several commands to kill processes from any terminal window, not just the one a program is running from. You can use a program like XTerm or Konsole to provide a fake terminal, or you can switch to a terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+function key; ie '''Ctrl+Alt+F2''' to Ctrl+Alt+F6 (depending on your system). Ctrl+Alt+F7 gets you back to the desktop (again, depending on your system).

The [[Guide to UNIX/Commands/Process Management]] page has more information on process management commands, but a few popular ones are below:
* '''pkill''' and '''killall''' are the most useful program-killing commands, and they do similar things. Just type
 pkill -[[w:SIGTERM|TERM]] ''program_name''
:or
 killall ''program_name''
:In addition, '''pgrep''' can be used to list running processes.

== Forcing the X Window System to Quit ==

* To kill and restart the X Window System, press '''Ctrl+Alt+Backspace'''. Lots of programs need X-Window, so using this will cause most running programs to quit or crash.
* You should probably try to reset your computer after this: type
 shutdown -r now
:to do this. You may need to be root.
* If you have access to the command line, you can also type
 sudo /etc/init.d/(gdm or kdm or xdm) shutdown
:to stop X.
* Note that the ability to restart X by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Backspace can be disabled from X's configuration file. In the X.Org implementation, a &quot;DontZap&quot; option can be added to xorg.conf to do this. If Ctrl+Alt+Backspace is not working, this may be the reason why.

If you do '''Ctrl+Alt+Backspace''' and you have a login manager like XDM enabled usually you will be thrown back to that after x RESTARTS. If you started X by typing startx this will usually throw you back to the command line

'''Ctrl+Alt+Backspace''' is useful for restarting X after changing the resolution, for example, too.

== Alt+SysRq ==

If all else fails, you may still be able to communicate with the [[w:kernel|Kernel]].

To use, just press the Alt and [[w:sysrq|SysRq]] (PrintScreen) keys and one of the keys listed below, all together. You should try switch into a terminal window, if possible, first by pressing '''Ctrl+Alt+F2''' ''(use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the desktop)''.

If your computer is not responding you can use the following steps to perform a reboot with less chance of [[w:fscking|fscking]] your files. This is a suggested method:
# Press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch to a terminal window. Sometimes, this is not possible.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''R''' to get the keyboard
# If pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2 before failed, try it again now.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''E''' to term all processes.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''I''' to kill all processes.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''S''' to sync your disks.
# '''Wait''' for OK or Done message. If you don't see a message, look at your HDD light to see if Sync made a difference.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''U''' to umount all disk drives.
# '''Wait''' for OK or Done message. If you don't see a message, in 15-30 seconds, assume disks are unmounted (or that an unmount is not posssible) and proceed.
# Press Alt+SysRq+'''B''' to reboot.

The Letters used spell REISUB - use the mnemonic ''Reboot Even If System Utterly Broken''. Another popular one is ''Raising Elephants Is So Utterly Boring'', or just spell BUSIER backwards.

The Full list of available commands is shown below. It's largely taken from [http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysrq.txt Documentation/sysrq.txt] in the Linux Kernel Sources.

Certain systems (systems administrated by a department or group other than yourself, e.g. a corporate or government location) may remove the ability to use the SysRq key combinations in order to secure their system from low level commands. If you try a few commands and notice nothing is happening, or error messages occur, this may be the case.

== The Big Red Button ==

The final option is, of course, the power button on your computer's physical exterior. Modern PCs have [[wikipedia:ACPI|ACPI]] buttons, which just send the shutdown request to the kernel. If the ACPI [[wikipedia:software daemon|daemon]] is listening and correctly configured, it can signal &lt;code&gt;[[wikipedia:init|init]]&lt;/code&gt; and perform a clean shutdown.

If ACPI doesn't work, you will need to cut off electrical power. This is done through a &quot;hard switch&quot; (generally labeled &quot;reset&quot;), possibly using the same button as before but holding it pressed for 5 or so seconds. Taking out the battery (on laptops) and physically disconnecting all power cables is, of course, the only method guaranteed to work. (Make sure no other method listed above works. Even as a last resort, unplugging your computer while it is running is still not recommended.)

Resetting without shutting down can cause problems with the file system. To try and fix this problem, fsck will be run when you next boot up, and journaling filesystems will attempt to complete or rollback files which were changing.

I am creating this XML Schema WikiBook for used by XML instructors everywhere.  The goal is to have linkable learning content that can be integrated into open source learning managment systems such as Moodle.  I have tried to be consistant and use ISO/IEC data element name conventions so this class is consistant with other classes in ebXML, NIEM and GJXDM.

Please feel free to add content by linking to seperate pages.

== View inconsistent tendency I have ==
Hello,

Under &quot;Common XML Schema Primitive Data Types&quot; table, the definition of &lt;sequence&gt; states that children can have zero or unbounded occurrence. The default is that it has a minimum occurrence of one time, and a maximum occurrence of one time. So, a child element must appear once and only once, unless the minOccurs or maxOccurs option is used.

Also, &quot;xsd&quot; as a prefix is used in the table, but xs is used in the example. Although both are valid, it seems inconsistent.

[[File:Deforestation near Bukit Tiga Puluh NP.jpg|right|400px|Deforestation and forest burning for oil palm plantation in the buffer zone of Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Riau Province, Indonesia.]]
In the second half of the 20th century the pace of growth of the world population and its technological capacity to utilise natural resources increased to such a degree that human activity now impinges on all segments of the biosphere. As the scale of habitat destruction has multiplied so have human efforts for the remainder to be vigilantly protected by applying ecological principles to safeguard, legislate, evaluate and manage fragile ecosystems and their declining species.  

Conservation on a global scale may be approached either through organisations that focus on its rare and endangered species or through the work of others that highlight the world's 'fragile' habitats. The international bodies that illustrate these two complementary approaches are the World Conservation Union and UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere programme.

The World Conservation Union (http://www.iucn.org/) began as the International Union for the Protection of Nature (or IUPN) founded in October 1948 following an international conference in Fontainebleau, France. The organization changed its name to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 1956 and became the  &quot;World Conservation Union&quot; began in 1990.  The full name and the acronym are often used together as many people still know the Union as IUCN

The theme of 'man and the biosphere' became an international concern in 1972 with the launch of UNESCO's programme of environmental research.  It is an interdisciplinary undertaking of environmental research initiated to develop the basis, within the natural and social sciences, for the rational use and conservation of the resources of the biosphere, and for the improvement of the global relationship between people and the environment. The hallmark of the MAB Programme is its holistic and interdisciplinary approach. Examination of human impacts on a specific ecosystem - that is, the interrelationship between people and the environment - requires studies of both the natural sciences (e.g. climatology, biology, soil sciences and forestry) and the social sciences (e.g. economics, human geography and sociology). Hence, the name of the programme: &quot;Man and the Biosphere&quot; or 'MAB'(http://www.unesco.org/mab/). 

The World Conservation Union is probably best known for monitoring the state of the world's species through the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  But it also supports and develops conservation science; implements this research in field projects around the world; and then links both research and results to local, national, regional and global policy by convening dialogues between governments, civil society and the private sector.

The priority of the Union's current Programme (2005-2008) is to build recognition of the many ways in which human lives and livelihoods, especially of the poor, depend on the sustainable management of natural resources.
In its projects, the Union applies sound ecosystem management to conserve biodiversity and builds sustainable livelihoods for those directly dependent on natural resources. The Union is actively engaged in managing and restoring ecosystems and improving people's lives, economies and societies.

The Union's databases, assessments, guidelines and case studies, prepared by its global membership, Commissions and Secretariat, are among the world's most respected and frequently cited sources of information and reference on the environment.

As the world's largest environmental knowledge network, the Union has helped over 75 countries to prepare and implement national conservation and biodiversity strategies. The Union also has the official status of Observer at the United Nations General Assembly.

UNESCOs MAB programme uses an applied ecological approach that focuses on mountain ecosystems, on arid lands or on humid tropical forests. Shortly after the programme was launched in April 1973, a panel of experts met in Salzburg, Austria, to discuss the &quot;Impact of human activities on mountain and tundra ecosystems&quot;. Its task was to elaborate the scientific content of projects to be proposed under the MAB Programme. The panel recommended study of the following factors: 

:human settlements at high altitudes;
:effects of land-use alternatives on mountain ecosystems;
:impact of large-scale technology on mountain ecosystems;
:effects of tourism and recreation on mountain ecosystems.

A working group assembled in Lillehammer, Norway, later in 1973 to define further the scope, objectives, methodologies and possible outputs of studies in areas where problems were acknowledged. This meeting led to a more clearly defined identification of thematic and regional problems requiring study, as follows: 

:resource development and human settlements in high tropical mountains (i.e. above 2 500 us and between the latitudes 30° north and 30° south), including the tropical Andes, the South Asia mountain complexes and the East African and Ethiopian highlands; 

:tourism, technology and land use in temperate mountains in the middle latitudes (approximately latitudes 30° to 60° north and south), where there are distinct winter and summer seasons; 

:land-use problems in high-latitude mountain and tundra ecosystems, with special reference to grazing, industrial development and recreation.

In order that study methods and results could be compared, the working group in Lillehammer identified tentative &quot;minimal&quot; research requirements for both natural sciences (e.g. climatology and soil sciences) and social sciences (e.g. sociology and economics). It was considered vital that the results of regional mountain studies in one area could be compared with those elsewhere in an international context. 

The variables identified for study in mountain areas may appear obvious and simplistic - air temperature, precipitation and wind velocity, for example, in climatic studies. Nevertheless, considerable efforts were made to achieve international agreement on a uniform and consistent methodology for research on mountain ecosystems within the framework of an intergovernmental scientific programme. Conceptually, the establishment of this catalogue of minimal research requirements was an important step forward in international cooperative research. As a consequence, a large number of case studies were carried out worldwide within the framework of the MAB Programme, in particular in the Andes and the Alps. 

In the early 1990s, the MAB Programme entered into a new phase following the decision of its governing body, the MAB International Co-ordinating Council. The three new major thrusts are: scientific capacity building, research on biological diversity and ecological processes, and promoting the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The third undertaking proved to be particularly successful and there are currently 352 biosphere reserves in 87 countries; of these, over 40 percent are located in mountain regions. 

Biosphere reserves are areas of terrestrial and coastal/marine ecosystems where, through appropriate zoning patterns and land management, the conservation of ecosystems and their biodiversity is combined with the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of local communities. Thus, they represent a major tool for implementing the concerns of Agenda 21 (such as Chapter 13 on mountains), the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international agreements. 

The concept of &quot;biosphere reserve&quot; implies environmental conservation, scientific research and sustainable development. The management of biosphere reserves aims to show that environmental conservation can be used to promote sustainable development based on scientific research findings together with a partnership with the local people. This is realized through a specific land-use system, which takes into account the topographic, biological, economic and socio-cultural characteristics of each site. 

Biosphere reserves have three different, but interrelated, functions: 

; Conservation : Biosphere reserves provide protection of indigenous genetic resources, plant and animal species, ecosystems and landscapes of value for the conservation of the world's biological diversity. 

; Development : Biosphere reserves seek to combine conservation concerns with sustainable use of resources through close cooperation with local communities, taking advantage of traditional knowledge, indigenous products and appropriate land management.
 
; Networking : Biosphere reserves are linked through a global network; they provide facilities for research, monitoring, education and training at the local level as well as for comparative research and monitoring programmes at an international or regional level.

While the relative importance of these three basic functions will vary from case to case, it is a combination of their roles that characterizes the distinctive feature of biosphere reserves. The articulation of these roles is translated on the ground through a pattern of zonation. This includes a core area (or areas) that is strictly protected according to pre-established conservation objectives. The core area is surrounded by, or contiguous with, a delineated buffer zone (or zones) where only activities that are compatible with the conservation objectives can take place. Finally, a more loosely defined transition area encircles the core and buffer areas and here cooperation with the local population and sustainable resource management practices are developed. 

At the heart of the international community's interactions with the global environment, particularly through actions mandated by two World Environment Summits, is the United Nationals Environment Programme (UNEP (http://www.unep.org/))  Biodiversity information for policy and action to conserve the living world is provided by UNEP's World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge.  Its programmes concentrate on species, forests, protected areas, marine, mountains and freshwaters; plus habitats affected by climate change such as Polar Regions. It also address the relationship between trade and the environment and the wider aspects of biodiversity assessment.(http://www.unep-wcmc.org/) 

Between them, MAB the WCU and the WCMC, are well placed to provide answers to questions about the state of major international habitats and rare species.

== Objective ==

This module is intended to describe some of the protected sites and species of major international importance with respect to the following three questions about their state as an endangered resource:

* What is happening?
* What is being done?
* What should be done?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Welcome to the Ada implementations of the [[Algorithms]] Wikibook.  For those who are new to [[Ada Programming]] a few notes:

* All examples are fully functional with all the needed input and output operations. However, only the code needed to outline the algorithms at hand is copied into the text - the full samples are available via the download links. &lt;small&gt;(Note: It can take up to 48 hours until the cvs is updated)&lt;/small&gt;.
* We seldom use predefined types in the sample code but define special types suitable for the algorithms at hand.
* Ada allows for default function parameters; however, we always fill in and name all parameters, so the reader can see which options are available.
* We seldom use shortcuts - like using the attributes {{Ada/attribute|Image}} or {{Ada/attribute|Value}} for String &lt;=&gt; Integer conversions.

All these rules make the code more elaborate than perhaps needed.  However, we also hope it makes the code easier to understand

Hi, I added a section to [[Cookbook:Policy#Cookbook_Pages]] which should be clear about what I meant. What I want to avoid is &quot;tagging&quot; all recipes which happen to be gluten-free/vegan/vegetarian in the page title; that is what categories are for. &quot;Tagging&quot; substantial variations in the title, however, is necessary for disambiguation. Oh, and I'm not sure &quot;(Diabetic)&quot; is the best naming convention... maybe &quot;(Low-GI)&quot;?

:I was importing some templates and noticed your concern about pending changes at Wikipedia on a template talk page.  Must be quite the twilight zone here, then, with every main space page subject to the system once an initial review is performed. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:48, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
::It's not quite the twilight zone, Adrignola.  The only thing which annoys me about pending changes is that it takes away some of the spirit of &quot;The encyclopedia anyone can edit&quot; - for some people, half the fun of editing Wikis is knowing that your work is out there immediately and you can feel proud of it.  Waiting for someone to check it first, (which on the German version of wikipedia has taken up to 4 weeks, and in my case, I still have an unsighted edit there from nearly 2 years ago), removes some of the joy of the work.  

I spoke to someone about PC here on the IRC channel yesterday evening, and they said someone here could assign me the editor bit, since I'm active at so many Wikis and well known to the en.wp community. Is that possible? [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 00:51, 25 June 2010 (UTC)
:Yes it is, and it's done.  I see that you've contributed here since 2006, so that was the basis for my decision to assign it.  (We don't take other wikis into consideration on that, by convention, despite the clout that Wikipedia does indeed have).  We have a backlog here too, but for many of us, there's not much to do about it because the system was in place before we got here and there's not enough participation to get a consensus for or against its continued use. Some people are concerned about it decreasing participation, just as some are at Wikipedia.  It's essential for the Wikijunior namespace at least, but elsewhere, that's the question.  Many just use it as a replacement for page patrol, which wasn't the point.  So there we stand. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:04, 25 June 2010 (UTC)

== I requested the removal of the editor flag ==
Hello BarkingFish. I'm sorry in having to contact you on this terms, but due to recent discussions regarding reviewer and editor flags and the future of these groups, I started to analise the status of some accounts especially in the editors group and noticed that your level of contribution and your requirements to perform normal Wikibookian tasks may not warrant granting you the editor flag.&lt;br&gt;
With all respect for you and your activity on the project, and hopping that you indeed get to need and use the reviewer and editor tools, I requested for the flag to be removed. Feel free to express your opinion on the running [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions#BarkingFish|Removal of access request]] or ask any questions here on your talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:34, 4 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zeitcatcher. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zeitcatcher~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Double Entry is the principle of accounting which requires that every transaction has two effects one of which is a debit and the other of which is a credit of the same amount. What this means is that the total of the Debits must always equal the total of the Credits.

In this example we deposit 10 units of currency into our bank account.
{{Drcr| date=2005&lt;br&gt;Feb | day=1 | cr = Cash (Asset) | dr = Bank (Asset) | amount = 10}}
Since the total of the Debits equals the total of the Credits we say the transaction is Balanced.


==The Accounting Equation==

*&lt;math&gt; A = Assets &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; L = Liabilities &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; F = Owners' Funds &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; C = Capital &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; D = Drawings &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; P = Profit &lt;/math&gt;

The Value of the business is the value of its assets less the value of its liabilities and this value belongs to the owners of the business:

&lt;math&gt;A - L = F &lt;/math&gt;

The Owners fund must also equal the amount the owners have put into the business (Capital) less any amounts they have taken out (Drawings) plus any profit.  For the time being we assume the business is profitable.


&lt;math&gt;A - L = C - D + P &lt;/math&gt;

We add &lt;math&gt;D + L&lt;/math&gt; to both sides to remove the minus signs.
&lt;math&gt;A + D = C + P + L&lt;/math&gt;

We call items on the left hand side Debits and items on the right hand side Credits.  Then:

&lt;math&gt; Total Debits = Total Credits &lt;/math&gt;

In order that this equation holds we must also ensure that a loss is on the opposite side to a profit and therefore a loss is a debit.  

Note that items of income increase profit so they are also credits, while expenses decrease profit and are therefore debits.

==When to Debit, when to Credit?==
Another look.
Debit (Dr) and Credit (Cr) only refer to which side of the double entry an account/value goes to. Debit on left, and Credit on right. The '''normal''' of an account refers to which side it normally increases on, whether it be good or bad for the company.

The D.E.A.D. C.O.I.L. Mnemonic

*Debit side
**Expenses
**Assets
**Drawing (of Equity)
*Credit side
**Owner's Equity
**Income
**Liabilities

Another-nother look.

Debit/Credit-ishness of an account comes from the elements of the accounting equation, Owner's Equity=Assets - Liabilities, and lots of flipping. 

Start by looking at the Dr. side. 
#If your account is an Equity term, flip it. 
#*Equity terms are Capital, Drawing, Income, Expenses. These are the financial borders of the business.
#If it's a Liability, flip it.
#*Liabilities are negative (well, it's good to have access to resources now, but they still are a hole that demands filling). Remember, if somebody prepaid you for a something you haven't fulfilled, that's a liability too!

Within all of this flipping, Debit/Credit has two meanings, whether a term is negative to the company's finances, and whether it is external to the company. By demanding each entry set to balance, the journal tracks motions of money (or widgets, labor..) in the company. Changes of value are expressed as a motion into yet another account, such as moving part of the &quot;Merchandise&quot; Asset (as Cr) into the &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; Expense (as Dr).

As a mnemonic device for students:
Note that only Assets and Expenses show an Increase for Debits and Decrease for Credits. All other accounts are the reverse. First memorize the acronyms AID (Assets Increase Decrease) &amp; EID (Expenses Increase Decrease)and then keep in mind that the table reads Debits on the left and Credits on the right.

== Overview ==

'''''Hannah Abbott''''' is a Hufflepuff student in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s year, a pink-faced blonde girl who wears her hair in pigtails. She's sweet, kind and giggly.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Hannah Abbott is the first student called up to be Sorted; the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] places her in Hufflepuff.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

'''Hannah Abbott''', here identified only as ''Hannah'', is one of the group of Hufflepuffs discussing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]]'s decision to remain in hiding when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is thought to be the Heir of Slytherin, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets/Chapter_11|''The Duelling Club'']].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===
At one point in their third year, Hannah was convinced that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] could turn into a flowering shrub, which in hindsight is less silly than it might sound at first.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

House loyalty had Hannah wearing a ''Support [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]!'' badge [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 19|early]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. Despite occasional incidents like this, she and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]] are on friendly terms with Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Both Hannah and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie]] became [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefects]] in August of Harry's fifth year.

Hannah is one of the students present at the initial meeting, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], of the group that becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]].

It is mentioned that Hannah Abbott, at Easter break some six weeks before the OWL exams, is looking frantic and checking stacks of books out of the library.

Hannah had the unhappy distinction of being the first of Harry's year to crack under the strain of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L.]] study, requiring a Calming Draught from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] after she broke down crying in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], saying she was too stupid to take her exams.

While Harry is taking his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|transfiguration]] O.W.L, Hannah somehow manages to turn her ferret into a flock of flamingos, postponing the exam for ten minutes.

Hannah is also one of the six members of Dumbledore's Army who see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] attempting to jinx [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] on the Hogwarts Express, and promptly return fire, leaving Draco, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] looking like gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts robes.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In this book, Hannah's mother is killed by a rumoured [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], and she leaves the school for most of the term after being told this in a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]] class.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry sees a grave marked &quot;Abbott&quot; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] and wonders aloud whether the person was one of Hannah's relatives. The question is never answered, but it serves to remind us of Hannah's mother having recently been killed by Death Eaters.

As Harry is on his way to the Room of Requirement, where he now believes Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem is hidden, he passes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred Weasley]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lee Jordan|Lee Jordan]], and Hannah Abbott guarding a hole behind a plinth where a statue had fallen. The statue had previously been masking one of the secret passages into Hogwarts.

As the renewed battle rages, Harry from under the Invisibility Cloak, casts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|Shield spells]] in the path of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s curses. Voldemort's intended victims, Hannah and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]], run past and into the Great Hall.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==
OWL exams make her worry to no end.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

She is most often seen in the company of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]].

In an interview given following the publication of the final book in the series, the author said that Abbot marries [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], and becomes the new landlady of the Leaky Cauldron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depreciation relates to an entity's change in fair market value and how the fluctuation in value is processed as a tax-deductible expense. 

* [[/Property, plant, and equipment/]]

== Depreciation ==
Depreciation occurs over a period of useful economic life, in which the property, plant or equipment is used to generate income for the business.

Several methods can be used to calculate the depreciable cost of an asset over its life, the most commonly used are:

*Straight-line method
*Reducing balance method

=== Straight-line Method ===

The Straight-line Method reduces the Net-Book value of an asset by the same amount each period.
This amount is determined by dividing the total value of said asset by some number of periods, then subtracted from the balance at the end of each period. 

For example,if you purchased a sewing machine for $12,000 and you wrote it off over 12 months using the Straight-line method, you would divide the original cost ($12,000) by the term of useful life (12 months).  In this case, $12,000 / 12 months = $1,000/month.  To apply depreciation on this item, you would deduct $1,000 at the end of the first month to leave a balance of $11,000. The second month you would deduct another $1,000 leaving a balance of $10,000. At the end of the 12th month, you would deduct the last $1,000 from the previous (11th months) balance of $1,000, leaving you with a balance of $0.

At this point you would say that you have ''written off'' the sewing machine. In practice, things get a little more complicated. In this example it would not be fair to assume that at the end of the 12th month the machine would suddenly stop working, or be absolutely worthless, though for tax purposes it is considered to have zero basis. It is possible you could still sell the completely written off sewing machine for $1,000, causing you to recognize a $1,000 taxable gain.

The economic reasoning behind the Straight-line method is, essentially, the acceptance that depreciation is an approximation of the rate at which an asset transfers value to the Operations of a business by participating productively in it, and so we should use the most economical one (regarding computational effort) to calculate and record it in the accounting books. There are certain ''Intangible Assets'' for which the Straight-Line method can be considered the relatively more accurate one. But for most ''Tangible Assets'' there is good argument that the Declining Balance method is more suitable (see below). Nevertheless, the simplicity of the Straight-line method had made it the prevailing one, accepted by economists, accountants, analysts, businesses, and even state authorities (for tax purposes).

=== Declining (or Reducing) Balance Method ===
The Net-Book value of an asset is reduced by the same proportion each period. That is, at the end of every period you reduce the value by a fixed percentage. Each period uses the previous period's balance to work out the amount.

For example, we purchase a motor-vehicle for $10,000 and we depreciate it by 10% per month. At the end of the first month we take $10,000 * 10% = $1,000, making the balance $9,000. At the end of the second month, we take the '''balance''' from the previous month and apply the 10% factor: $9,000 * 10% = $900.  Note the change in depreciation: in the first month the expense was $1,000, but in this month it is $900. At the end of this second month, you subtract the new depreciation amount, resulting in $9,000 - $900 = $8,100. The depreciation for the third month, then, is $8,100 * 10% = $810; the remaining value at the end of the third month is $8,100 - $810 = $7,290. At the end of 12 months the balance would be $3138.11.

The economic reasoning behind the Declining Balance Method of Depreciation is that any asset (think of machinery to stay focused), no matter how carefully serviced by its user, is most productive during the earlier periods of its productive use. Mathematically, the same depreciation rate will extinguish the value of an asset much more quickly under The Straight Line Method than under the Declining Balance Method. In the above example, a $10,000 value with a 10% monthly depreciation rate will be extinguished after 10 months of calculating and recording depreciation by the Straight Line method. But it will take ~22 months to extinguish 9/10 of the value under depreciation using the Declining Balance Method on the same value and with the same depreciation rate. So caution should be exercised when choosing the Declining Balance Method.

=== The &quot;Useful Life&quot; approach ===
Since Accounting Depreciation attempts to capture a real economic phenomenon, it must be based on economic reasoning. It is not a mechanical procedure or an arithmetic exercise. The prevailing concern when determining depreciation methodology should not be to &quot;guess&quot; the correct depreciation rate, but to estimate reasonably the useful life of the asset under depreciation in time-units, and then calculate the corresponding depreciation rate that will result in extinguishing the value of the asset from the books when the estimated useful life ends too, given the Depreciation method chosen.

In the Straight-Line method, the mapping of Useful Life to Depreciation Rate is easy. If &quot;x&quot; is the estimated useful life, say in years, then the Yearly Depreciation Rate &quot;d&quot; is d = 1/x. For example, if you expect that the company will use a vehicle for 10 years, then the Yearly Depreciation Rate for this vehicle is 1/10 = 0,1 = 10%, under the Straight-line method.

In the Declining Balance Method, things are trickier. First we must note that from a mathematical point of view, the value of the asset is never fully extinguished under the Declining Balance method, but it approaches arbitrarily close to zero. In practice, companies that use the Declining Balance Method, decide on a &quot;materiality threshold&quot; for the non-depreciated (residual) value of the asset, usually up to 10% of its initial purchase value.  Essentially then, they calculate the depreciation rate which, under the Declining Balance method, will extinguish the largest part of the Value of the asset (i.e. 90% or 95%) at the end of its economic useful life. When they reach that point in time, they depreciate what's left in the next accounting period.

Now, the Declining Balance method is expressed as a Difference Equation. Denote &quot;d&quot; the depreciation rate, &quot;r&quot; the remaining value at the end of the estimated useful life, as a percentage of initial purchase value (=&gt;  0 &lt; r &lt; 1) and V(t) the nondepreciated value of the asset at the end of period t. Denote also &quot;n&quot; the useful life of the asset, say in years. 
Then you have
 V(t) = (1-d)*V(t-1)    subject to  V(n)= r*V(0) where V(0) is the purchase value of the asset.

Going backwards in the Difference equation and writing for period &quot;n&quot; you get

 V(n) = (1-d)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;*V(0)  together with  V(n)= r*V(0)

Solving together the two equations you get
 (1-d)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = r 

So we see that by estimating the useful life of the asset (the &quot;n&quot;), and given that we have chosen a residual value (the &quot;r&quot;, as a percentage of the initial purchase value of the asset), we can uniquely determine the required depreciation rate &quot;d&quot; to use in our depreciation calculations so that our accounting books reflect, at least approximately, what happens in actual economic activity.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==General Elections==

Members of the House of Commons are elected in General Elections.
General Elections are called by the Prime Minister.  General Elections are held at least once every five years. The maximum term that a parliament can exist before a new election interrupts it is defined by parliament. Currently, the [[w:Parliament Act|Parliament Act]] states that five years is the maximum length.

==Local Elections==

From 2007 Scotland will use Single Transferable Vote to elect all of its local councillors.  England and Wales use first past the post or multiple-member first past the post for local elections.  Northern Ireland uses STV for its local elections.

==European Elections==

Members of the European Parliament for Northern Ireland are elected using Single Transferable Vote (STV).  MEPs for England, Scotland and Wales are elected using the D'Hondt method.

----
There are a number of commercial and free software tools available that are designed to help the System Administrator strengthen the security of their system. Depending on the security requirements, a number of these utilities can be employed on a regular basis to strength-check their system security, look for indications of an attack or a compromised system, and implement more secure procedures.

==COPS==
This venerable package consists of a series of scripts and binaries that can be used to check some basic security configurations on a UNIX system. The last update to this package was version 1.04, released in 1991. hence this tool is starting to show its age, and may require some fine tuning to operate on a modern version of UNIX. The output will vary according to the UNIX vendor and OS version. (There is also a perl version included in the package, but was based on a much older version of perl and is known to have some bugs.)

The following groups of checks are performed by the COPS utility:

# Check selected system directories for world-write permissions.
# Check specific system files for world-write permissions.
# Check all files on the system for setuid status and note changes.
# Check for insecure entries in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.
# Check the format of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file.
# Check the root account &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt;, and for a root entry in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/ftpuser&lt;/code&gt;.
# Check for world-writeable files in &lt;code&gt;/etc/rc*&lt;/code&gt;.
# Check for world-writeable files in &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/crontab&lt;/code&gt;.
# Check specific startup and configuration files in the user home directories.
# Use the ''U-Kuang'' rules-based expert system to check for potential security exploits.

==Checksum utilities==
There are UNIX utilities such as &lt;code&gt;cksum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;md5&lt;/code&gt; that can be used to read the contents of a file and produce a one-way hashed values, or checksums, as an output. The value of the resulting string will change whenever the contents of a file is changed, so this utility can be used to check whether a downloaded file has been tampered with inappropriately. The string can also be used to check whether a file was corrupted during the download process.

For example,

 $ mdf important_data.pdf
 MD5 (important_data.pdf) = 46df33cb1473394c32a8910d162eb913

Whenever a System Administrator downloads a program or patch that will be executed on a UNIX system, it is important that the checksum of the file be compared with the value at a secure source. This will help to protect the system from illicit tampering. Many vendors will provide checksum values for the downloadable files that they make available. When possible, a stronger utility such as &lt;code&gt;md5&lt;/code&gt; should be used instead of &lt;code&gt;cksum&lt;/code&gt;, as this will make it vastly more difficult for an attacker to produce a tampered file that has the same checksum.

Checksums can also be used to validate the binary commands on a system. Some integrity-checking utilities such as &lt;code&gt;tripwire&lt;/code&gt; use multiple checksum programs to search for file modifications.

==OpenSSH==

      <text xml:space="preserve">When distilling herbs into teas, you will likely want to crush them for maximum effect.  This can be done in a number of ways.

==Mortar and pistel==
A [[w:Mortar and pestel|mortar and pestel]] is useful for any kind of leafy, grassy, woody, or tuberous herb.  This consists of a ''mortar'', a small stone bowl; and a ''pestel'', a stone stick.  The pestel can be used to grind anything against the rough surface of the mortar.

A mortar and pestel can be used to crush herbs up very well, releasing as much juice or oil as possible.  The mortar and pestel can easily be flushed into whatever preparation vessel is being used in recipes involving water; this prevents mechanical loss.  Simply pour some of the water over the pestel and into the mortar, then pour out into the preparation vessel.

==Garlic press==
A [[w:Garlic press]] is a quick and dirty way to crush tuberous or bulbous herbs.  It consists of a metal screen and a press, and works by forcing the stiff root through the metal screen.

Garlic presses are also relatively easy to flush, and quick to use; however, they do not crush the herb up as well as a mortar and pestel.

==Shredder==
A shredder or grater can be used as a fast and easy method of grinding up most leafy, grassy, or tuberous herbs.  Many graters have a rough side filled with small holes lined with jagged edges, useful for shredding plants into a pulpy form.

Shredders are fast and easy to use, but difficult to prevent mechanical loss in.  The pulpy result sticks to the grater, and flushing a large one can be difficult.

=Morphy Defence=
By far the most commonly played Black third move in the Ruy Lopez game is the Morphy variation, 3...a6, which &quot;puts the question&quot; to the white bishop.
Although 3...a6 was known earlier, it became popular after it was played by Paul Morphy.
White has only two good options, [[/4. Bxc6|4. Bxc6]] or [[/4. Ba4|4. Ba4]].
The main point to 3...a6 is that after the common retreat 4.Ba4, Black will have the possibility of breaking the pin on his queen knight by playing ...b5.
In fact, White must take some care to not fall into the Noah's Ark Trap in which Black traps White's king bishop on the b3-square with a ...a6, ...b5, and ...c4 pawn advance on the queenside.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some resources on this topic:

In ''Classroom Instruction That Works: Research-Based Strategies for Increasing Student Achievement'', Robert  J. Marzano analyzes research from more than 100 studies on classroom management. He synthesizes the findings from these studies into a series of &quot;Action Steps&quot;, which include specific strategies that educators can use. 
The Action Steps relate to setting the tone, establishing effective rules and procedures, implementing appropriate disciplinary interventions, fostering productive student-teacher relationships, developing a positive &quot;mental set,&quot; and helping students contribute to a positive learning environment. Marzano and his coauthors Jana S. Marzano and Debra Pickering provide stories of teachers and students in classroom situations to help illustrate how the action steps can be used successfully. 

Also available are books by Emmer, Evertson and Worsham, including ''Classroom Management for Secondary Teachers'' and ''Classroom Management for Elementary Teachers''. 

The best-selling book on this topic (according to Amazon.com) is ''The First Days of School'' by Harry Wong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Want a Wikibooks account? ==
Thanks for updating [[US History/Contents/W Bush]] page to match current events. Those expensive printed textbooks might not have Samuel Alito on the US Supreme Court yet, but our free textbook [[US History]] is already updated because of ''you''.

It is optional, but if you want, you can '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. If you already have an account, '''[[Special:Userlogin|log in]]'''. A Wikibooks account is easy to create; it does not require any personal information (only a name or pseudonym, plus a password); it identifies you as a user (even if your Internet address changes from &quot;71.96.150.44&quot; to something else); it lets you track your own contributions and keep a [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] of pages.

Whether you use an account or not, we [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] hope that you enjoy your time at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:51, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Use===

The subjunctive mood is used to describe circumstances in which there is doubt, to express emotion, or opinion through the use of impersonal expressions (Es bueno/malo/triste que...) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The perfect subjunctive is used in reference to something that happened very recently. 

Espero que '''tú hayas hecho''' la tarea. &lt;br&gt;
I hope that '''''you have done''''' the homework. &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Es muy triste que '''''los niños no hayan escrito''' sus ensayos. &lt;br&gt;
It is very sad that '''''the children have not written''''' their essays. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===Formation===

The perfect subjunctive is formed by combining the present subjunctive form of the verb ''haber'', meaning ''to have'', with the past participle of the functional verb. &lt;br&gt;

'''''Haber''''', present subjunctive
*Yo haya
*Tú hayas
*Usted, ella, él haya
*Nosotros hayamos
*Vosotros hayáis
*Ustedes, ellas, ellos hayan

'''[[Subject:Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement]]''' exams are created and administered by the College Board, The same organization that does SATs. The AP exam tests your knowledge of a specific subject at the college level. It is scored from 1 to 5, with 3 usually being the minimum to get college credit. The tests are taken in May, and the scores usually arrive by July.

It is not necessary to take an AP class to take that exam, and vice versa. However, it is a good idea to do so.

Unlike the SAT, AP exams contain open-ended questions in conjunction with multiple choice questions. Before the May 2011 AP exams, points were taken off for incorrect multiple choice answers, but this is not done at present.

== Colour-code a string ==

Is there any method on wikibooks to colour-code a string? Specifically, I want to colour-code the entries in [[The Computer Revolution: A Timeline]] into either hardware, system software and internet. There needs to be a way to follow each individual thread but there also needs to be a way to easily see where they fit in between each other. Thanks for the earlier advice btw. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 08:42, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

:Most format stuff is documented in [[m:Help:Editing]], and they have color in [[m:Help:HTML in wikitext]], but for this you might need [[CSS]]. Things like &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #99ff99;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #99ff99;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) work in my browser. CSS seems to work the same way on this wiki as it does in [[Programming:HTML|HTML]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:16, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks. Ciao.

== [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] ==

I'm trying to understand your motivation on why this Wikibook needs to be merged with the bookshelf that it is part of.  You havn't posted a reason on the discussion pages, although I am presuming there is a motivation.  There are distinctly different motivations between the Wikibook and the other proposed (or stub) Wikibook modules on the bookshelf.  One thing I am trying to avoid doing (but seems to be happening with this Wikibook, unfortunately) is to turn this Wikibook into a macropedia, or a smaller encyclopedia about a specific topic.  By eliminating the serial programming bookshelf, this is encouraging even more the effort to turn this Wikibook that I have organized into chronological chapters intended to be read sequential (or at least reference previous chapters heavily).  By dumping the reference material into this Wikibook, it just encourages more of the macropedia philosophy.

I have it listed under computer network topologies due to my desire to eventually turn this book into an introduction to simple computer networks.  I think serial programming techniques are a good laboratory way to introduce the topic that can teach many levels of the OSI network model where a student can experiment and perhaps come up with other networking models, or at least understand why things happen the way that they happen in current networks.

In addition, there was an earlier VfD discussion [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Archive 2#various Serial Programming orphan-stubs|about this topic on the VdD page]].  The discussion was removed on October 8th if you want to go through the VfD history and find it.

I appreciate you efforts to try and clean up Wikibooks, and this is certainly something that needs a little bit of attention.  I just think that merging the contents of this bookshelf into the Wikibook is not the best approach and will do more harm than good.  I do want to raise the standards of not only this Wikibook but also Wikibooks as a whole.  Work with me to get the serial communication bookshelf cleaned up, and I think there is a compromise that can be accomodated. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:36, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:The cause of my (now removed) merge suggestion was a misapplication of [[WB:NC]]/[[WB:NP]] (neither enforced) and the [[Serial Programming]] redirect. See my comment at [[Talk:Serial communications bookshelf]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:34, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

== Mass, gravity, weight, etc, etc in [[Wikijunior Solar System]] ==

Re all the above, I'd appreciate your thoughts on [[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]]'s comments [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity#Well written -- maybe too much for this book|here]] on my talk page, especially his highlighting [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight]]; thanks in advance. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 16:43, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Have just responded to your comments on the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity#Well written -- maybe too much for this book|''About weight and gravity'' talk page]] &amp;ndash; thank you for your thoughts. Meanwhile, I'd appreciate your pointing out what you found to be obtuse language in the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] module itself, so I may try to avoid it in future. Thanks, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 14:24, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== De-indenting ==

Thanks for your effort to try and keep Wikibooks clean and usable by fixing the indentation on some talk pages. However, you didn't do it correctly everywhere. In many cases, a direct response (one more : than the previous comment) was changed to a brand new comment (no :s at all). That is not what the talk page help page means by cleaning up and refactoring. In the future, please read the discussion and see what the content of the comments are, not just the user who made them. For example, [[Wikibooks talk:Dispute resolution]] was fine the way it is, but now you moved my responses to Whiteknight out to the left and the discussion is now broken up. I would appreciate a little more caution in the future. Thank you, my friend. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:33, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:Sorry. I was not reading the &quot;refactoring&quot; section of [[Wikibooks:Talk page]], I was reading the section that says &quot;use indenting to keep the conversation straight&quot;. I thought that was consensus on this wiki, but apparently [[Wikibooks:Talk page]] is only a proposed policy, and something that was copied from Wikipedia. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:48, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Deleting a Wikipage ==

It has been noted on [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics Engineering Acoustics]] that I need to clean up or remove some pages.  Problem is that I am not able to remove old pages that have been accidently unlinked.  Any idea how to fix this or delete the pages(old pages are not needed)?  Thanks [[User:Mpspence|Mpspence]]

:This is a [[Meatball:FullHistory|FullHistory]] wiki, so we keep a [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page history]] of all previous versions of every page here. If there is an old orphan page &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; which was replaced with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, you should make a redirect from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; - see '''[[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Help:Redirect]]'''. (But first check that there is no new material in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; missing from &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.) Then, on talk page for Acoustic:B, add a comment that some old page history is available at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Any wiki user can do this, so I might make the redirects if no one does it before when I would.

:With a redirect, if there is an external link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:A]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; from outside Wikibooks (for example, in a search engine), the link works because Wikibooks redirects it to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:B]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

:If you actually need to delete page, read [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:54, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== Question from my RfA ==

You had wondered if I had any experience as an Admin on another MediaWiki. The answer is no, but I feel I should qualify that. I am a very active participant at Wikipedia, including working on the AN, the AN/I, and the AN/3RR. I have followed Admins and know what the task requires. Quite a few people at WP already think I'm an Admin there. A couple of people have discussed nominating me over there as well. I know a few of the tasks can be tricky (IP range blocking, etc.), therefore will start off slow and work my way up to doing the more complicated things. I hope this adresses any concerns you may still have. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:07, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Prerequisite 1:  Understanding OpenGL''' ==


OpenGL is an interesting topic to cover, since the Anim8or program and many other commercial 3D modelers run on OpenGL.


'''What is OpenGL'''

OpenGL is an API (Application Programming Interface) which interacts directly with the video hardware in your computer to produce different types of graphics very fast.  This approach to graphics is much faster than what’s called software-based graphics.  The main problem with Software-based graphics is that it is not using the full potential of your video card.  Usually, the software-based approach is used to create simple graphics such as the user interface in Microsoft Word.  But for 3D graphics to run at full speed you need direct contact with the video hardware for optimal performance.  That is the purpose of OpenGL.

One more thing to discuss is how OpenGL makes the programmer’s life a little bit easier.  OpenGL takes care of interfacing with the video hardware by itself without the programmer writing any code to do that.  In the early days of graphics programming, programmers would sometimes have to write a lot of code just to interact with the video hardware.  Now they don’t have to worry about that.  They can just concentrate on drawing graphics.

A collection of data can be modelled with the Normal Distribution if the data produces a fairly bell-shaped curve when put into a histogram and has the same mean, median and mode - that is to say most of the data is in the middle of the diagram, with the bins becoming smaller toward the outside. If a sample of data is truly normally distributed, about 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

The normal distribution's probability density function is:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \, e^{ -\frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''standard normal distribution''' is a special case in which the mean, &amp;mu;, is 0 and the standard deviation, &amp;sigma;, is 1. Its p.d.f is:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \, e^{ -\frac{x^2}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating this function in order to obtain probabilities is a trifle difficult if you're an S2 candidate, so it is usual to use calculator functions or tables of cumulative probabilities (these give probabilities from -&amp;infin; to a particular value).

      <comment>/* Windows Memory */ Page size is dictated by the processor architecture and active mode of operation</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">C programmers will undoubtedly be familiar with the stdlib memory allocation functions, malloc, realloc, calloc, etc. These functions are based off a number of other functions in the Win32 API that deal with memory segments.

== Windows Memory ==

When talking about the memory subsystem, there are 4 distinct types of memory that Windows manages, and each type of memory has a number of different functions to allocate and free that memory. 

;Virtual Memory: The Virtual Memory subsystem allocates and manages memory by pages. This means that memory can only be allocated in blocks of 4 Kbytes (or larger, depending on processor architecture) at a time. This is a fantastically large amount of memory for most applications, and using the virtual memory functions in most programs is overkill. However, some programs do need use of entire pages for storage, so the Virtual Memory subsystem can be used for that.
;Heap Memory: The heap is an area of memory that usually takes up a whole page, or a fraction of a page. Each process is allocated a heap immediately by windows, called the process heap. The stdlib functions such as malloc will allocate memory from this memory region. The heap can be divided up into small memory segments, for use with variables and dynamic storage.
;Global Memory: Windows maintains at least 1 page of memory for use as general-purpose global memory. This memory can be read or written by any process running on the computer, using the global memory functions. Data in the global memory space can be shared among various programs, and items sent to the windows clipboard are generally stored in global memory (so it can be &quot;pasted&quot; into any program). Global memory is limited, so it should not be used without a specific need.
;LocalMemory: Local memory has similarities to both global memory and heap memory. It is local to the process, but the memory is managed by the Windows memory manager, and not by the program. We will discuss this later.

== Virtual Memory Subsystem ==

The virtual memory functions, as explained above, allocate memory in terms of pages. Pages are generally 4 Kbytes of memory, so most applications won't need to allocate an entire page (much less more then 1 page). The Virtual memory system is essentially the primitive function base that the other memory functions utilize to perform their tasks. For instance, the heap is comprised of 1 or more pages, and the heap functions will allocate pages using the virtual memory system when needed.

When virtual memory blocks are allocated, they are not actually being utilized, they are simply reserved by the system for future use. Other functions need to be used to segment the virtual memory pages into useful segments. Since virtual memory is allocated by pages, a number of special paging features can be used on virtual memory that can not be used on other types of memory. For instance, pages can be locked (to prevent read/write access), or they can be protected from any particular access mode (read, write, execute).

That said, there are a number of functions in the virtual memory subsystem that can be used:

;VirtualAlloc:
;VirtualFree:
; VirtualProtect:
; VirtualLock:
; VirtualQuery:

== Heap Memory ==

Each program is provided with a default process heap, but a process may optionally allocate any number of additional heaps, if more storage is needed. The heap functions will manage their virtual memory usage automatically, and therefore heaps can be set to grow if they are being filled up with data. If a heap is allowed to grow automatically, the heap functions will automatically allocate additional pages as needed. On the x86 architecture the heap grows in size towards higher memory addresses. 

To use heap memory, a heap must first be allocated (or a handle must be obtained to the default heap). Once you have obtained a handle to a heap, you can pass that handle to the memory allocation functions, to allocate memory from that particular heap.

The stdlib memory functions (malloc, realloc, calloc, free) are all used very similarly to the heap functions, so programmers familiar with the stdlib functions may be able to figure out what many of the heap functions are doing, by examining their names:

;HeapCreate:Allocates a heap, and returns a handle to that heap. All the other heap functions will use this handle to uniquely identify the particular heap that you are accessing. By maintaining multiple handles, your program may interface with multiple separate heaps.
;HeapDestroy:This function closes a heap handle, and deallocates the heap memory so that other processes can use it.
;GetProcessHeap: This function returns a handle to the default process heap. Each program gets a default heap when it is loaded, and in most applications this should be enough space to store data items.
;HeapAlloc:Similar to the STDLIB &quot;malloc&quot; function, HeapAlloc allocates storage space on the heap, and returns a pointer to that space. 
;HeapReAlloc:Similar to the STDLIB &quot;realloc&quot; function, HeapReAlloc reallocates the storage space of a variable to be a different size.
;HeapFree:Frees a memory object on the heap. Attempts to use the same pointer to access memory after it has been freed will cause an error.

== Global Memory ==

Windows maintains a certain amount of global heap memory. This memory is limited compared to regular process heaps, and should not be accessed unless global memory is specially required.

When data has been written to the global memory, you don't get a pointer to that data, but instead you get a handle for that data. Once you give your data to the global memory manager, the system is in charge of it. Remember, a handle is not a pointer, and should never be used as one. The system will manage the memory in the global memory section, moving it between pages, and defragmenting it, et cetera.data doesn't reside within a single segment

;GlobalAlloc:
;GlobalFree:
;GlobalDiscard:
;GlobalLock:
;GlobalUnlock:
;GlobalFlags:
;GlobalSize:
;GlobalHandle:

== Local Memory ==

Local memory, in this sense, is not the kind of storage that programs utilize internally, on the stack and otherwise. Instead, Windows manages a special section of memory that it dubs to be &quot;Local Memory&quot;, and it provides a number of functions to allocate and manage this special memory. Local memory is similar to global memory in the sense that data is written to the local location, and the system returns a handle to that data. The system will manage the data, just like in global memory. The local functions are named very similarly to the global memory functions. However, the global memory and local memory functions should never be mixed. For instance, a global memory handle should never be closed with the LocalFree function. 

;LocalAlloc:
;LocalFree:
;LocalDiscard:
;LocalFlags:
;LocalLock: 
;LocalReAlloc: 
;LocalUnlock:
;LocalHandle:

      <comment>/* Unicode escape sequences */ Combined two sentences to help with flow, and discarded unnecessary use of the exclamation point.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=Unicode}}
{{Programming/Navigation|lang=Java|previous=Random numbers|next=Classes and Objects}}
__NOTOC__{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Most Java program text consists of [[wikipedia:ASCII|ASCII]] characters, but any Unicode character can be used as part of identifier names, in comments, and in character and string literals. For example, π (which is the Greek Lowercase Letter '''pi''') is a valid Java identifier:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-100&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.100: Pi.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double π = Math.PI;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

and in a string literal:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-101&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.101: Pi literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String pi = &quot;π&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Unicode escape sequences ==
Unicode characters can also be expressed through Unicode Escape Sequences. Unicode escape sequence may appear anywhere in a Java source file (including inside identifiers, comments, and [[Java Programming/Literals|string literals]]).

Unicode escape sequences consist of
# a backslash '&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;' (ASCII character 92, hex 0x5c),
# a '&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;' (ASCII 117, hex 0x75)
# optionally one or more additional '&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;' characters, and
# four hexadecimal digits (the characters '&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;' through '&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;' or '&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;' through '&lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;' or '&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;' through '&lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;').

Such sequences represent the UTF-16 encoding of a Unicode character. For example, 'a' is equivalent to '\u0061'. This escape method does not support characters beyond U+FFFF or you have to make use of surrogate pairs.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;3.1 Unicode&quot;, The Java™ Language
Specification [http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jls-7-mr3-fullv-oth-JSpec/JLS-JavaSE7-Full.pdf], Java SE 7 Edition, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any and all characters in a program may be expressed in Unicode escape characters, but such programs are not very readable, except by the Java compiler - in addition, they are not very compact.

One can find a full list of the characters [[Unicode/Character reference|here]].

π may also be represented in Java as the ''Unicode escape sequence'' &lt;code&gt;\u03C0&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the following is a valid, but not very readable, declaration and assignment:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-102&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.102: Unicode escape sequences for Pi.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
double \u03C0 = Math.PI;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The following demonstrates the use of Unicode escape sequences in other Java syntax:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-103&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.103: Unicode escape sequences in a string literal.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Declare Strings pi and quote which contain \u03C0 and \u0027 respectively:
String pi = &quot;\u03C0&quot;;
String quote = &quot;\u0027&quot;;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Note that a Unicode escape sequence functions just like any other character in the source code. E.g., &lt;code&gt;\u0022&lt;/code&gt; (double quote, &quot;) needs to be quoted in a string just like &quot;.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-104&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.104: Double quote.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Declare Strings doubleQuote1 and doubleQuote2 which both contain &quot; (double quote):
String doubleQuote1 = &quot;\&quot;&quot;;
String doubleQuote2 = &quot;\\u0022&quot;; // &quot;\u0022&quot; doesn't work since &quot;&quot;&quot; doesn't work.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== International language support ==
The language distinguishes between bytes and characters. Characters are stored internally using UCS-2, although as of J2SE 5.0, the language also supports using UTF-16 and its surrogates. Java program source may therefore contain any Unicode character.

The following is thus perfectly valid Java code; it contains Chinese characters in the class and [[Java Programming/Variables|variable]] names as well as in a string [[Java Programming/Literals|literal]]:
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-50&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.50: 哈嘍世界.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public class 哈嘍世界 {
    private String 文本 = &quot;哈嘍世界&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Introduction ==


The '''Advanced Certificate''' and the '''Advanced Diploma''' in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries''' were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

Further information can be obtained from '''angela.lees@sqa.org.uk'''


=== What are these qualifications? ===


These qualifications are based on the training already carried out as during the People’s Network programme. They have been developed by the [http://slainte.org.uk Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)] and are accredited by the  [http://www.sqa.org.uk Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)]. The level of the qualifications is roughly equivalent to a UK Higher National Certificate or Diploma (HNC/HND), a US Associate Degree or years 1 and 2 of a UK or US undergraduate degree. Credit for approximately one year of study may be transferable to other academic programmes.


The '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), SLIC, CyMAL''' (the Welsh body) and '''DCAL''' (the Northern Ireland department) supported the development of the qualifications for use throughout the UK. SQA is currently exploring accreditation with the '''QCA (Qualifications &amp; Curriculum Authority)''' and articulation into higher education. The qualifications have been reviewed by content advisers from across the UK in order to balance any variation in the context of library service delivery and the learning materials contain UK-wide examples of best practice.

=== Who are they for? ===


These qualifications will permit library staff who have already undergone the '''People’s Network''' training to obtain accreditation, but they are also suitable for '''new entrants''' to the profession. The main target group is staff working in the UK public library service, but the qualifications are also likely to be of interest to staff in other library services, particularly '''school libraries'''. They may also be of interest to English-speaking library staff in other countries.


Candidates would normally be expected to have reached a reasonable level of general education, for example A-Level or SCE Higher and possess reasonable ICT skills, such as PC Passport or ECDL. 


=== What is the content? ===


The '''Diploma in Applications of ICT in Libraries''' consists of five single-credit units (each roughly equivalent to 40 hours of study), as follows: 

*Unit 1: Locating information on behalf of clients
*Unit 2: Supporting reader development
*Unit 3: Supporting users to ensure effective learning
*Unit 4: Using ICT in professional practice
*Unit 5: Supporting clients in the safe and legal use of ICT


The '''Advanced Diploma in Applications of ICT''' in Libraries includes all of the above units, plus the following double-credit units, each roughly equivalent to 80 hours of study: 

*Unit 6: Net Navigator	
*Unit 7: Educator 
(candidates must choose one of these)

*Unit 8: Graded Unit – Project


Summaries of the '''unit content''' can be found later in this document.


=== What support material is available? ===

A wide range of support material is available, including top-up learning material, assessment tools and electronic log-books to record assignments for authentication in the workplace. The top-up learning material is available in Wikibook format and also in an interactive web-based format at http://www.ictl.org.uk.

The top-up material includes activities, prompts and refresher learning. More than 600 pages of material have already been written and this is being expanded all the time. The top-up learning can be integrated with People's Network, cascade or new training and work-based practice.


=== How are they assessed? ===


Almost all of the assessment is of a practical nature and involves the completion of logbooks relating to workplace activities, essays and reports. Most assessments can be submitted online.


=== How do they relate to professional qualifications? ===


The qualifications support the '''CILIP Framework of Qualifications''' and can be used as evidence towards Certification, Chartership and Revalidation submissions. The Diplomas are based on reflective practice, and electronic logbooks make it easy to build portfolios. 


=== What are the benefits? ===


There are a number of benefits for individual and employers in supporting this development. Staff will have the chance to have their People’s Network learning accredited, improve their qualifications, gain academic credits for transfer into other courses or improve their promotion prospects. From the employer's perspective, the qualifications will contribute towards workforce development and meeting corporate quality agendas such as Investors in People and Charter Mark.


=== How can I get further information? ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Implement [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Reference/API5.2.2/com/webobjects/appserver/WOComponent.html#isStateless() isStateless] in your WOComponent and you will be able to manage the state yourself:

  public boolean isStateless() {
    return true;
  } 

==== Chuck Hill ====
There is some fairly OK information on stateless and nonsynchronizing components in Practical WebObjects.  In a nutshell you need to use valueForBinding/setValueForBinding to access bound values and implement a public void reset() method that nulls all instance variables.  This often requires design changes to your component.

==== Jean-François Veillette ====
Sometimes for stateless component, you need to keep variables values between the 3 phases, from takeValueFromRequest all the way to appendToResponse.  Since ivars in a stateless component can't handle this case (reset() will be called after each phase), you have to store the information somewhere.  Just use context.userInfo dictionary, and put whatever value in there.  As the name imply, the value will only be good for this request only.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Keyboard ==

When a key is pressed on the keyboard, the signal travels into the computer, where the kernel gets it. These signals, or &quot;keycodes&quot; as they are called, are raw data that needs to be translated into ASCII characters. The kernel performs this conversion, as well as obtaining other information about the keystroke. The necessary information is encoded into a message, and is sent to the currently active window. Simultaneously, the message is sent to the currently active '''caret'''. 

=== Cursor Vs Caret ===

Inside Windows, there is a large terminology problem. So many different things all need to get their own names, so we can program with them, and keep everything straight. A perfect example of this is the difference between the '''cursor''' and the '''caret'''. The cursor is the graphical image that represents the mouse. It can either be an arrow for pointing, a hand, an hourglass, or an I-shaped text selector. The '''caret''', on the other hand, is the blinking object that is used to enter text. When you type, the letter appears at the caret, and the caret moves forward by 1 space. It is important to keep these terms straight, because if you confuse them inside your program, you could have a lot of debugging to do.

=== Keypress Messages ===

There are a few keypress messages that the program can choose to handle. It is important to note that not all of these messages need to be handled in a program, and in fact it is usually a good idea to not handle many of them.

;WM_KEYDOWN:The WM_KEYDOWN message indicates that a key has been pressed, or that it has been pressed and held down. If the key is held down, the keyboard goes into &quot;Type-Matic&quot; mode and generates keypress events repeatedly at a certain frequency. The kernel will generate a WM_KEYDOWN message for each of these, with the LPARAM message component containing the number of messages sent by the Kernel in succession, so that your program can choose to ignore some of the messages and not miss any of the information. In addition to the Key count, the LPARAM will contain the following information:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
  |-
  ! Bits of LPARAM !! Purpose
  |-
  | 0-15 || Key Count
  |-
  | 16-23 || Scan Code
  |-
  | 29 || Context Code 
  |- 
  | 30 || Previous State 
  |-
  | 31 || Key Transition
  |}
:The scan code is the raw binary signal from the keyboard, which may not correspond to the ASCII value of the character. Notice that all buttons on a keyboard generate a scan code, including action buttons (Shift, ALT, CTRL). Unless you are trying to interact with the keyboard in a special way, you want to ignore the scan code. The Context Code determines if the ALT key is pressed at the same time. If the ALT key is pressed at the same time, the Context code is 1. The Previous State is the state of the button before the message was generated. The Key Transition determines whether the key is being pressed, or if it is being released. Most of the fields in the WM_KEYDOWN message can be safely ignored by most programs, unless you are trying to use Type-Matic functionality, or are trying to interface on a low level with the keyboard.
;WM_KEYUP:This message is sent when a key that was being pressed has been released. Every key press will generate at least two messages: a Key down (when the button is pressed) and a Key Up (when the button is released). In general for most text-processing applications, the Key Up message can be ignored. The WPARAM is the value of the virtual character code, and the LPARAM is the same as for the WM_KEYDOWN message.

=== Accelerators ===

Windows users will no doubt be familiar with some of the common key combinations that are used with large windows programs. CTRL+C copies an object to the clipboard. CTRL+P prints the current document. CTRL+S saves the current document. There are dozens more, and it seems like each program has its own specific key combinations.

These key combinations are known in the Windows world as &quot;Accelerators&quot;. A program that uses accelerators will define an '''accelerator table'''. This table will contain all the different key combinations, and the command identifier that they each map to. When an accelerator is pressed on the keyboard, the program doesn't receive the keypress messages, it instead receives a WM_COMMAND message, with the command identifier in the WPARAM field.

To translate the accelerator keypress combinations into WM_COMMAND messages, the function TranslateAccelerator needs to be used in conjunction with the message loop, as such:

 while(GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0))
 {
    if(!TranslateAccelerator(&amp;msg))
    {
       TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
       DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
    }
 }

The TranslateAccelerator function will automatically dispatch the WM_COMMAND message to the appropriate window.

=== Using the Caret ===

Each program may only have 1 active caret, and worse than that, the entire system may only have 1 active caret on the screen at a time. When using a caret, the programmer needs to take special care to destroy the caret when it is not in use, and to recreate the caret when needed. This can be accomplished relatively easily by creating the caret on the WM_SETFOCUS message (when the window is made active), and by destroying the caret on the WM_KILLFOCUS and WM_DESTROY messages.

== The Mouse ==

The mouse has more messages associated, because the mouse is capable of more unique tasks than the keyboard is. For instance, the mouse has at least 2 buttons (frequently 3 or more), it often has a trackball, and it can be hovered over objects on the screen. Each of these functions of the mouse can be handled via messages, so we are going to need several messages

=== Mouse Messages ===

There are a number of mouse messages that may be handled by the program.

;WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK: The user double-clicked the left mouse button. 
;WM_LBUTTONDOWN: The user pressed the left mouse button. 
;WM_LBUTTONUP: The user released the left mouse button. 
;WM_MBUTTONDOWN: The user pressed the middle mouse button. 
;WM_MBUTTONUP: The user released the middle mouse button. 
;WM_MOUSEMOVE: The user moved the mouse cursor within the client area of the window. 
;WM_MOUSEWHEEL: The user rotated or pressed the mouse wheel. 
;WM_RBUTTONDOWN: The user pressed the right mouse button. 
;WM_RBUTTONUP: The user released the right mouse button. 

In addition, the LPARAM field will contain information about the cursor location, in X-Y coordinates, and the WPARAM field will contain information about the state of the shift and CTRL keys. 

The system will handle the graphical mouse movements, so you don't need to worry that your program is going to lock up the mouse. However, the program is capable of changing the mouse cursor, and sending mouse messages to other windows, if needed.

== The Timer ==

Timers are used to space the flow of a program via pauses, so that a group of actions can be allowed to process before another group interacts with the result. In a strict sense, the Windows Timer is not a user input device, although the timer can send input messages to the window, so it is generally covered in the same manner as the mouse and the keyboard. Specifically, Charles Petzold's famous book, &quot;Programming Windows&quot;, treated the timer as an input device. 

A common use of a timer is to notify the program of the end of a pause so that it can erase an image previously painted on the screen, such as in screensavers that display various images from one folder. The native timer function, however, is not considered accurate for games or time-critical responses. The DirectX API is preferred for games.


Each time the specified time interval assigned to the Timer elapses, the system sends a WM_TIMER message to the window associated to the Timer.

The new Timer starts timing the interval as soon as it is created by the '''SetTimer''' function. When you create a Timer you retrieve a unique identifier that can be used by the '''KillTimer''' function to destroy the Timer. This identifier is also present in the first parameter of WM_TIMER message.

Let's see the functions syntax.

&lt;pre&gt;
UINT_PTR SetTimer(      
    HWND hWnd,              //Handle of the window associated  to the timer 
    UINT nIDEvent,          //an identifier for the timer
    UINT uElapse,           //the time-out value, in ms
    TIMERPROC lpTimerFunc   //the address of the time procedure (see below)
);

BOOL KillTimer(      
    HWND hWnd,              // Handle of the window associated to the timer
    UINT_PTR uIDEvent       // the identifier of the timer to destroy
);
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to reset an existing timer you have to set the first argument to NULL, and the second to an existing timer ID.

You can process WM_TIMER message in two different ways:

'''-''' by processing the WM_TIMER message in the window procedure of the window passed as first argument.

'''-''' by defining a TimerProc callback function (fourth argument) that process the message instead of a window procedure.

Let's see the first one.

&lt;pre&gt;
#define IDT_TIMER1 1001
#define IDT_TIMER2 1002

...

SetTimer(hwnd,                 //handle of the window associated to the timer
         IDT_TIMER1,           //timer identifier
         5000,                 // 5 seconds timeout
         (TIMERPROC)NULL);     //no timer procedure, process WM_TIMER in the window procedure

SetTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER2, 10000, (TIMERPROC)NULL);

...

LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc (HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam){
  
    ...
   case WM_TIMER:
    switch(wParam)
    {
     case IDT_TIMER1:
       //process the 5 seconds timer
     break;

     case IDT_TIMER2:
       //process the 10 seconds timer
     break;
    }
   ...


/* to destroy the timers */
KillTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER1);
KillTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER2);

&lt;/pre&gt;


Now using a '''TimerProc'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
VOID CALLBACK TimerProc(

    HWND hwnd,	// handle of window for timer messages 
    UINT uMsg,	// WM_TIMER message
    UINT idEvent,	// timer identifier
    DWORD dwTime 	// current system time
   );
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is called by the system to process an associated Timer's WM_TIMER message.
Let's see some code.

&lt;pre&gt;
#define IDT_TIMER1 1001
...

/* The Timer Procedure */
VOID CALLBACK TimerProc(HWND hwnd,	 
                    UINT uMsg,	
                    UINT idEvent,	
                    DWORD dwTime)
   {
          MessageBox(NULL, &quot;One second is passed, the timer procedure is called, killing the timer&quot;, &quot;Timer Procedure&quot;, MB_OK);

          KillTimer(hwnd, idEvent);
   }

...

/* Creating the timer */
SetTimer(hwnd, IDT_TIMER1, 1000, (TIMERPROC)TimerProc);

...

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Timer Messages ===

The timer only comes with a single message, WM_TIMER, and the WPARAM field will contain the timer ID number.

=== Timer Modes ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) ==
In essence, MFC is a [[w:Software development kit|SDK]] interface, a library consisting in a set of classes that act as wrappers around portions of the [[w:Windows API|Windows API]], so that C++ programmers may program Windows using some concepts of the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and the C++ language (the Win32 API is based on C, as seen in [[Windows Programming/C and Win32 API|C and Win32 API Section]] of the book). One should learn the Win32 API or at least have some ideas since some functions are absent from the MFC and would help you to better understand the SDK.

Some tools, such as [[w:Microsoft Visual Studio|Microsoft Visual Studio]], are capable of automatically generating large amounts of MFC skeleton code for use in a project. Because of this, most MFC tutorials or reference materials will teach the subject using the automated Visual Studio tools, and leave out some of the gritty details. In this book where possible we try to be neutral.

MFC was first oriented mostly for enterprise-level programming projects, created in an age most code was done in C and Object Oriented Programming was only in the realm of Smalltalk. 

Since the release of Visual Studio 6.0 and the MFC 6.0 little was known of the future support to the MFC since the company was favoring the .NET Framework. Version 7.0, 7.1 and 8.0 were mostly extensions to support the new OSs and to aid developers in migrating to the new framework. Since then information on the future of the MFC could be only extracted from Steve Teixeira, Microsoft Corporation, June 2005 paper - '''MFC: Visual Studio 2005 and Beyond''', on the release of Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1, Microsoft seems to once again be actively supporting the MFC.

Many users today find it acceptable for a low complexity program to have a memory footprint of 30-80Mb (this is common in Java or .Net applications), low response times or &quot;outside of your control&quot; applications like the internet now provides. It is therefore debatable if the impact of  use of MFC in small applications outweighs the benefits the libraries provides. Most of the software made specifically for Windows today uses MFC.

You should prefer the Win32 API SDK, or an alternative wrapper for it, if you do not intend to:

#'''Make use of a complex GUI, use the document/view architecture or complex controls.'''&lt;br&gt;  This will increase the use of system resources (memory use, exe and install size).
#'''Use other libraries that depend on the MFC.'''
#'''Have a complex install for your application.'''&lt;br&gt;To distribute MFC-Based project you must build it with static MFC libraries or distribute your project with the needed MFC dlls. There is no guarantee that your customer has the required dlls for your program. Old MFC-Based programs must work with new MFC versions. They should but don't do it always. Your customer will not be very happy if after installing your project some of his old software products begin hanging.

=== MFC and C++ ===
The MFC design principle is an attempt for simplification. The wrapper classes were designed so to simplify some tasks and automates others. Because of those facts, however, a certain amount of fine-tunable control was lost from the raw Win32 API or excessive automation was archived. The MFC has been recognized as having serious design flaws and inconsistencies and has not been actively maintained. The C++ language and best practices have evolved and today this constitutes a barrier for the utilization of the framework.

As MFC predates the STL standardization in to the C++ language, it implements its own versions of the STL containers, not as complete and even inconsistent, this simplistic solutions the MFC implementations tend to be faster, however you should prefers to use the STL when ever you can, it will make the code more C++ standard and permit easier portability in converting the code to multi-platform.

;Multiple Inheritance
The MFC class library does not use and Multiple Inheritance and was not designed with full support for Multiple Inheritance.

Since most MFC classes derive from CObject using Multiple Inheritance will be cause problems of ambiguity (any reference to CObject member functions will have to be disambiguated). Static member functions, including &lt;tt&gt;operator new&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;operator delete&lt;/tt&gt; must also be disambiguated.

The best option is to avoid the use of Multiple Inheritance with MFC but take a look at [http://web.archive.org/web/20090911094049/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/62x3wzxy(VS.71).aspx Using C++ Multiple Inheritance with MFC] (msdn.microsoft.com) for the needed information on how to bypass the limitations.

=== MFC Conventions ===
The MFC uses the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions#Hungarian Notation|Hungarian notation]]. It uses prefixes, like &quot;m_&quot; to indicate a member variable or &quot;p&quot; to indicate a pointer, and the rest of the name is normally written out in CamelCase (the first letter of each word is capitalized).

;CObject as the Root for most MFC Classes
All the significant classes in MFC derive from the CObject class. The CObject does not have any member data, but does have some default functionality.

== Using MFC ==

MFC requires header files that are separate from the standard &lt;windows.h&gt; header file. The core of the MFC system requires the inclusion of '''&lt;afxwin.h&gt;'''. Other header files that are of some use are '''&lt;afxext.h&gt;''' (for MFC extensions), and '''&lt;afxcmn.h&gt;''' (for the MFC common dialog boxes).

Simply changing the header files, unfortunately, is still not enough. The MFC DLL libraries must be linked to by the project, because the DLL files contain the class definitions that will be used throughout every program. To use MFC, you must link to the MFC libraries

=== stdafx.h ===
'''stdafx.h''' is the standard include for MFC projects - that is, if you create a new MFC project, a stdafx.h will automatically be created for you. It will include all the rest of the necessary MFC header files.

=== theApp ===

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
extern CYourAppClass theApp;
&lt;/source&gt;

Use in the header file of your application class and then include it wherever you need to use '''theApp'''.

You could try the ''AfxGetApp'' function to get a pointer to '''theApp''', an efficient method of accessing members of your application is to make a pointer to '''theApp''' a member variable of the class which needs it -- for example: 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class CMyDialog : public CDialog 
{ 

  // other class stuff here... 
  
  // Attributes 
  public: 
    CMdiApp* m_pApp; 
}; 
&lt;/source&gt;

and make sure you initialize ''m_pApp'' in the constructor or else will be 
accessing a '''NULL''' pointer. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
CMyDialog::CMyDialog(CWnd* pParent /*=NULL*/): CDialog(CMyDialog::IDD, pParent) 
{ 
           //{{AFX_DATA_INIT(CMyDialog) 
           //}} AFX_DATA_INIT 
           // Outside the special-format comments above... 
           m_pApp = (CMdiApp*)AfxGetApp( ); 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

and voila!  Now any time you need access to your application, you got it!

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
m_pApp-&gt;m_nMemberVar; 
m_pApp-&gt;MemberFunction(nParam1, strParam2);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Getting Started ==

First and foremost, it must be mentioned, that MFC is not the brand of C++ programming that &quot;looks like C&quot;. MFC makes heavy use of the object-oriented features of C++, which can seem &quot;dense&quot; or even unreadable to a new C++ programmer. It is highly recommended that the reader become very familiar with C++ concepts such as classes and hierarchies now, if they are not familiar concepts yet.

The root class for MFC is the '''CObject''' class. CObject itself does not support multiple inheritance, but derivative classes do. Each application begins in a class derived from '''CWinApp'''. Every program must have a CWinApp class, and each application may only have one. CWinApp contains a number of functions for initializing an application, and controlling the instance handle (similar to the HINSTANCE member of the WinMain function). Programs that want to display a window must utilize a derivative of the '''CWnd''' class.

== Basic MFC Program ==
We will outline here a basic MFC program that will create a simple window, but won't handle any user input. From this basic outline, we will be able to tackle more difficult subjects.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;afxwin.h&gt;  //basic MFC include
 
//class derived from CFrameWnd, which is derived from CWnd
class Basic_Window:public CFrameWnd
{
   public:
       Basic_Window()
       {
            Create(NULL, &quot;Basic MFC Window&quot;);
            // In some cases you might want to use
            // Create(NULL, _T(&quot;:Basic MFC Window&quot;));
       }
};
 
//class derived from CWinApp, which is the main instance of our application
class MyProgram:public CWinApp
{
      //a pointer to our window class object
      Basic_Window *bwnd; 
   public:
 
      //this is essentially our &quot;entry point&quot;
      BOOL InitInstance()
      {
           bwnd = new Basic_Window();
           m_pMainWnd = bwnd;
           m_pMainWnd-&gt;ShowWindow(1);
           return 1;
      }
};
  
//the program class instance pointer
MyProgram theApp;
&lt;/source&gt;

As we see here, we are immediately relying on class definitions and inheritance, so it is a good idea for readers who are not completely familiar with these topics to brush up on them before continuing.

== Global Variables ==
MFC provides a number of global variables, that are instantiated and then utilized in the underlying MFC framework to compile your program. We can see this in our basic example code when we use the variable '''m_pMainWnd'''.

== Cleanly closing an MFC application ==
The generic solution is &lt;tt&gt;PostQuitMessage([exit code]);&lt;/tt&gt;, but take care to cleanup any lingering resources (closing documents, deallocating memory and resources, destroying any additional windows created etc), on the other hand using &lt;tt&gt;AfxGetMainWnd()-&gt;PostMessage( WM_CLOSE );&lt;/tt&gt; can be a better method in some situations, since it triggers the correct shutdown sequence. This is especially important on MDI/SDI applications because it gives a chance for documents to prompt for save before exit or for the user to cancel the exit.

== Wait mouse cursor ==
To display a busy/wait mouse cursor the MFC as added a simple helper class. Instantiate a CWaitCursor class inside a function and a wait cursor is then displayed for the duration of that function, auto destruction of the class will restore the cursor state.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
CWaitCursor aWaitCursor;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Threads ==
As it should be expected the MFC also wraps the Win32 thread primitives in special classes and functions of its own. For generic information of threads and C++ see the [[C++ Programming/Threading|C++ Programming Wikibook section on Multitasking]]. The MFC devised threads in worker threads and GUI threads.

=== Worker threads ===
Worker threads are especially useful to perform background tasks, or any asynchronous work that doesn't require user intervention, a print job, calculations, waiting for an event, etc. To create a worker thread, the simplest way is to implement a function that will perform the desisted work, and then create the thread with &lt;code&gt;AfxBeginThread()&lt;/code&gt; that will use that specific function.

=== Communication ===
{{TODO|Complete}}

=== Exit strategy ===
Never use &lt;code&gt;TerminateThread()&lt;/code&gt; unless you have no other choice to guarantee a thread termination. It is poor practice and dangerous.

A proper thread exit can be archived by a normal return from the thread (completion) or by signaling it to return prematurely. Since we are working on Windows and on a 32 bit bound CPUs (making 32 bits accesses atomic), it is considered safe (but not portable) to use a shared &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; variable to indicate to a thread to exit, any other synchronization methods can be used if available. 

Since the only issue regarding thread termination is on aborting a job or exiting the program without having threads running, when dealing with worker threads, in the class that created the thread on the destructor you should signal the thread to abort and then use &lt;code&gt;WaitForSingleObject()&lt;/code&gt; to wait for the thread to terminate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">People familiar with Windows have doubtless heard a number of different terms used, such as COM, DCOM, COM+, ActiveX, OLE, etc. What precisely are all these things, and how are they related?

== Introduction to COM ==

Component Object Model (COM) is a binary-interface standard for software componentry introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It is used to enable interprocess communication and dynamic object creation in a large range of programming languages. The term COM is often used in the Microsoft software development industry as an umbrella term that encompasses the OLE, OLE Automation, ActiveX, COM+ and DCOM technologies. COM essentially lays a framework for classes to be created in any language, and to be instantiated into any other languages. A class may be written in C++, and called from VisualBasic, C# etc. Essentially, COM defines an interface that all languages must follow, if they want to participate in COM programs.

== COM Libraries ==

COM classes, written in a compileable language (such as C++ or VisualBasic) may be compiled into DLL libraries. DLL libraries that contain COM classes are not compatible with DLL libraries written in C that contain regular C functions. However, DLL files may be compiled such that they contain both standard C functions, and COM classes.

Files that contain COM classes are refered to as &quot;COM modules&quot;, or &quot;COM Components&quot;. Just like with other dynamic linking applications, Windows will manage the COM interface between components automatically, so long as all the modules properly use the COM specifications.

== UUID ==

The COM system relies on numerical identifiers known as '''Universally Unique Identifiers''' (UUID). A UUID is a 128 bit number that is essentially guaranteed to be unique COM identifier throughout the entire world. The UUID number is a hash value based on the MAC address of your primary network card (if your computer has one) and the real-time clock value of your processor. This means that the only way to generate 2 UUIDs that are identical would be to generate both at exactly the same time on exactly the same computer. Thankfully, this is impossible to do. 

COM components are given a UUID number, so that they can be differentiated from all other COM components, and any given COM module can be identified by a single numeric identifier.

After the original versions of COM were introduced, there became a clear need to expand the functionality of the COM model, and to make some changes to the general framework. Later versions of COM were given various names, such as DCOM and COM+.

== DCOM ==

DCOM stands for &quot;Distributed COM&quot;, and is a protocol for linking COM components from across a local area network (LAN). DCOM allows COM components to be stored on external &quot;COM servers&quot;, and used from other computers in the network.

== COM+ ==

COM plus = COM + MTS

== .NET ==

When the COM design team tried to create a framework that was more easy to use then COM, more portable, and more universal, they created the .NET framework. Originally, .NET was supposed to be introduced as the next version of COM, but instead Microsoft made it into its own entity. COM development has essentially stopped, to focus more attention on the .NET platform.

Because .NET has its roots in COM, it shares many of the guiding principals of COM. First, many different OO languages can be compiled into a single intermediate language. This allows software written in C++, C#, VB.NET, and other .NET languages to be easily interfaced together to create mixed-language programs quickly. In addition, .NET has strong support for distributed computing (a la DCOM). The .NET platform is quickly being standardized, and is available on several different platforms. Therefore, .NET is not strictly a Windows-programming topic, and will likely not be covered much throughout the rest of this book.

The HTML Help Workshop is a tool for creating compiled HTML help applets, that are common on many platforms. The compiled Help modules may then be used as stand-alone information sources, or as help-modules from inside a program. HTML help modules are relatively easy to create, and only require a knowledge of basic HTML to get started. 

HTML Help modules can be separated by topic, and the HTML Help Workshop will automatically compile a table of contents, and create an option to search, if specified.

== Obtaining the HTML Help Workshop ==

The HTML Help Workshop can be obtained from Microsoft as a free download. The HTML Help SDK should contain all the header files, library files, and object files that are needed to link help files into existing applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types of Drivers ==

Windows device drivers generally come in 2 flavors: '''Virtual Device Drivers''' (VXD) and '''Windows Driver Model''' (WDM). VxD style drivers are older, and are less compatible, while WDM drivers are supposed to be fully code-compatible all the way back to Windows 98.

== Driver History ==

In the old days of DOS, the computer was free land where anything goes. To that end, developers wrote their own hardware drivers, conforming to no specific specification or interface, using real-mode assembly code. With the advent of Windows 3.0, the operating system began to take a more hands-on approach to application management, by creating and maintaining a variety of virtual machines, to execute different programs in different processor contexts. Drivers could no longer exist as non-conformist real-mode DOS drivers, but instead had to mitigate access between multiple programs, running more or less in parallel with each other. Windows 3.0 changed the &quot;real devices&quot; into managed resources known as &quot;virtual devices&quot;, and replaced the real-mode drivers with new '''virtual device drivers''' (VDD).

The Windows NT product line existed as a separate entity from the &quot;regular&quot; windows brand. These two operating systems were completely different in almost every imaginable way, except perhaps that the shells looked similar. Windows NT was a fully-managed operating system, and unauthorized resource accesses were blocked by the NT kernel. This meant that in Windows NT, device drivers needed to interface with the computer through specific methods, while standard windows drivers (Windows 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, Me) could access hardware directly, without any sort of management. The drivers for both systems at this point, were generally written in assembly language, as well.

Realizing that the market was split between Windows and Windows NT, Microsoft saw a need to introduce a single driver model, so that device drivers could be portable between Windows and Windows NT. In addition, Microsoft knew that drivers had to be writable in a higher-level language, like C, in order to be code-compatible for different hardware systems. To meet these needs, Microsoft created the '''Windows Driver Model''' (WDM). WDM drivers are compiled using the DDK, they are written in C, and they follow exacting specifications that ensure they can be executed on any windows system. This book will attempt to focus on WDM drivers, but will include notes on writing DOS TSR drivers, and VDDs as well.

== Driver Issues ==

Device Drivers operate in kernel mode so writing, testing, and debugging drivers can be a tricky task. Drivers should always be well tested before they are installed.

Since device drivers do not operate in user mode, the user mode libraries (kernel32.dll, user32.dll, wingdi.dll, msvcrt.dll) are not available to a device driver. Instead, a device driver must link directly to ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll which provide Native API and executive services.

== Writing a Driver ==

Device drivers are typically written in C, using the '''Driver Development Kit''' ([http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Programming/Device_Driver_Introduction#External_Links DDK]). There are functional and object-oriented ways to program drivers, depending on the language chosen to write in. It is generally not possible to program a driver in Visual Basic or other high-level languages.

Because drivers operate in kernel mode, there are no restrictions on the actions that a driver may take. A driver may read and write to protected areas of memory, it may access I/O ports directly, and can generally do all sorts of very powerful things. This power makes drivers exceptionally capable of crashing an otherwise stable system.

The Windows platform DDK comes with header files, library files, and a command-line compiler that can be used to write device drivers in C or C++. There is no graphical interface to the DDK compiler.

== Device Driver Stack ==

Windows implements device drivers in a highly-modular fashion, and it is important that we discuss some vocabulary before we continue the discussion of driver programming any further. The drivers necessary for any particular device are arranged in a driver stack, and are connected together internally by a singly-linked list, that starts at the bottom of the stack (the '''root driver'''), and terminates at the highest level driver. Each driver ''must'' contain at least 2 modules, a root driver, and a '''function driver'''. This combination, with some optional additions, constitute the whole of what people generally call a complete &quot;device driver&quot;. Function Drivers will be the most common type of driver to be written, and will be of a primary focus in this wikibook. 

Microsoft realized that certain classes of devices all behave similarly, and it would be a gigantic waste of time for every hardware manufacturer to have to write the entire driver code from scratch. To this end, Windows allows for a type of driver known as a '''class driver'''. Class drivers are themselves not complete function drivers, but class drivers can be dynamically linked to a regular function driver, and can simplify the development process quite a bit. It is possible to write your own class driver, but 3rd party programmers generally don't worry about it. In general, Microsoft will supply the class drivers, and driver developers will tap into those class drivers. This ensures that class drivers are fully microsoft tested and certified, and that they are very versatile. 

Another classification of driver is the '''filter driver'''. There are two general types of filter driver, an '''upper filter driver''', and a '''lower filter driver'''. Upper filter drivers exist in the stack above the function driver, and--as their name implies--they filter the incoming I/O requests. Lower filter drivers are placed in the stack between the function driver and the root driver. Filter drivers are generally implemented as bug fixes, or as quick hack extensions for preexisting drivers.

Here is a general diagram of a driver stack:

 Upper filter driver
      |
      |
   Function Driver &lt;-------&gt; Class Driver
      |
      |
 Lower Filter Driver
      |
      |
   Root driver

    Hardware

== Buses and Physical Devices ==

For simplification, let us use the term &quot;bus&quot; to refer to any place on your computer where information can travel from one place to another. This is a very broad definition, and rightfully so: the term &quot;bus&quot; needs to account for everything from USB, Serial ports, PCI cards, Video outputs, etc. Each bus is controlled by its own root driver. There is a USB root driver, a PCI root driver, and so on. 

Let's now consider a mythical construct known as the '''root bus''', a structure that all other buses connect into. A root bus object doesn't actually physically exist in your computer, but it is handy to think about it. Plus, the root bus has its own driver. The root bus driver object is responsible for keeping track of the devices connected on any bus in your entire computer, and ensuring that the data gets to where it is all going.

== PnP ==

Plug-n-Play (PnP) is a technology that allows for the hardware on the computer to be changed dynamically, and the PnP software will automatically detect changes, and allocate important system resources. PnP gets its own root driver, that communicates closely with the Root bus driver, to keep track of the devices in your system.

== Device Namespace, and Named Devices ==

== &quot;Arbitrary Context&quot; ==

Drivers execute in the context of whatever thread was running when windows accessed the driver. To this end, we say that drivers execute in an &quot;arbitrary context&quot;. Therefore, it is not good practice for a driver programmer to make any assumptions about the state of the processor at the entry point to a driver. There are a few issues that arise with this, so we will discuss them here.

=== Floating Point Arithmetic ===

Drivers that want to use MMX or floating point arithmetic may find they are in for some undue difficulty. Because a driver may be entered in any context, at any time, the floating point unit may contain partial results and unhandled exceptions from the user mode program that was interrupted to call the driver. It is not enough to simply save the context and then to restore it, because any unhandled exceptions may become &quot;unhandleable&quot;, and raise a system error or a bug check. There are only certain times when Microsoft recommends using floating point arithmetic, and we will discuss them later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What it is ==

The Windows DDK comes on CD with a number of different options. Specifically, the DDK is capable of writing device drivers for a number of different platforms (Win9x, WinNT, WinServer), and is capable of targeting several different processors (IA-32, IA-64, and Itanium). Installing the necessary components for every platform on every processor can take up allot of harddisk space. In addition, the DDK comes with many examples of how to write everything from parallel port controllers to file system drivers, display drivers, and ethernet drivers. Installing all the examples can also take up a large amount of disk space.

See also: [[Windows Programming/Obtaining the DDK|Obtaining the DDK]]

== Checked and Free Environments ==

The DDK comes with a number of different batch files, that will create a suitable driver programming environment. The different batch files will create an environment to program for a specific OS/Processor combination. Each different environment will set a number of global variables that the compiler and linker will read to make decisions about the code generation. Compiling a driver using the wrong environment will lead to a driver that may not be compatible with your system (and may destabilize your computer). 

For each target platform, there are two environments available: '''checked''' and '''free'''. The Checked environment is essentially a debug environment, that will add additional debugging bloat to your compiled drivers, and will perform additional error checking and warnings. The Free environment, however, does not contain any debugging information, and should only be used to compile a fully-debugged device driver.

== The Tools ==

The DDK comes with the compiler: '''cl.exe''', the linker: '''link.exe''', and an assembler: '''ml.exe'''. When writing device drivers, it is recommended that you only use these particular files, and that you do not use any other versions of these programs that you may have on your computer (either from the SDK or Visual Studio). The DDK will also come with a number of header files. Some of the header files you may be familiar with, but some of them will contain function prototypes for kernel-mode libraries, that most programmers are unfamiliar with.

== Opaque Members ==

The DDK defines a number of different data structures for use in device drivers. However, because drivers operate at kernel mode, it is important to realize that many of the fields of these structures are for use only internally to the kernel, and your driver should not alter them. These data fields are known as &quot;Opaque&quot; members of the structure, and should be treated as if they were a &quot;protected&quot; or &quot;private&quot; member of a C++ class. Data fields that are not explicitly mentioned in this Wikibook should be considered suspect, and if there are any outstanding questions about the availability and use of a particular data field, consult MSDN or the DDK documentation.

== Warning ==

Device drivers should always be thoroughly debugged before installing on a system. If a faulty device driver is installed in the system, it could compromise the kernel at boot, making the entire system unstable, if not completely unusable. Uninstalling a faulty driver can be difficult, especially if you need to perform a rescue boot operation on your computer. Device drivers should be written with care, and fully debugged before installing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Windows Shell consists primarily of explorer.exe, the graphical user interface that displays folders, icons, and the desktop. Explorer.exe is written primarily in C++, so to write extension modules is going to require OO programming. However, there are several functions, in &lt;windows.h&gt; that a C program can use to interact with the shell to perform some basic tasks. First, we will describe some of the basic areas of your shell.

== The Shell ==

'''explorer.exe''', the Windows shell program, has a number of different functions that can be used to cause your program to perform tasks like the shell would. We will run over a few of them here:

=== ShellExecute ===

The ShellExecute function takes a file and a pathname as arguments, and essentially performs whatever task the shell would perform if the file in question was double-clicked. For instance, calling a ShellExecute on &quot;MyFile.txt&quot; would open notepad, and would display MyFile.txt. Similarly, calling ShellExecute on a hyperlink will automatically open Internet Explorer (or your default browser) and will open the specified URL.

 HINSTANCE ShellExecute(HWND hwnd,
                        LPCTSTR lpOperation,
                        LPCTSTR lpFile,
                        LPCTSTR lpParameters,
                        LPCTSTR lpDirectory,
                        INT nShowCmd);

;hwnd: The handle to the parent window of the operation
;lpOperation: The text name of the operation. These are the strings that appear in the menu when you right-click an icon. Some common values are &quot;edit&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, or &quot;execute&quot;. 
;lpFile: the name of the target file
;lpParameters: If lpFile specifies an executable file, the lpParameters field contains the commandline arguments to the executable, if any
;lpDirectory: specifies what directory to perform the operation in
;nShowCmd

== The Desktop ==

== The Taskbar ==

== The System Tray ==

The system tray is the area in the lower-right hand side of the screen that contains the clock and a number of different icons. Icons can be added to the system tray by using a simple API call. The function call to be used is the '''Shell_NotifyIcon''' function, and we will explain it here.

 WINSHELLAPI BOOL WINAPI Shell_NotifyIcon(DWORD dwMessage, PNOTIFYICONDATA pnid);

This function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is a message, and the second argument contains more information on the message. There are 3 messages possible:

 NIM_ADD    Add a new icon to the system tray
 NIM_DELETE Delete an icon from the system tray
 NIM_MODIFY Modify an existing icon in the system tray

We can see that the second argument is a pointer to the NOTIFYICONDATA structure. This structure contains fields as such:

 typedef struct _NOTIFYICONDATA { 
  DWORD cbSize;
  HWND hWnd; 
  UINT uID; 
  UINT uFlags; 
  UINT uCallbackMessage; 
  HICON hIcon; 
  WCHAR szTip[64]; 
 } NOTIFYICONDATA, *PNOTIFYICONDATA;

;cbSize: This should reflect the size of the NOTIFYICON structure. If we have a structure called &quot;nid&quot;, we usually assign this member as follows:

 nid.cbSize = sizeof(NOTIFYICONDATA);

;hWnd: This field contains the handle of the parent window. When the notify icon is clicked, a corresponding message will be sent to this window.
;uID: This is a numerical identifier for the icon in question. A program can have up to 12 different icons at once.
;uCallbackMessage: This is the message that will be sent to your window. This message should be WM_USER or greater. The WPARAM field of the message will contain the uID of the icon in question.
;uFlags: This member tells the shell which fields are valid fields. If a field does not contain any information, or if you don't want to use a particular field to set or modify a value, do not list them in the uFlags member. The possible values are NIF_ICON, NIF_MESSAGE, and NIF_TIP.
;hIcon: a handle to the icon to be displayed in the system tray. must be a 16x16 icon.
;szTip: A short string that contains a &quot;tooltip&quot; for the icon. When the mouse is hovered over the icon, the tooltip will be displayed. leave this blank, if you do not want to have a tool tip displayed.

== The Recycle Bin ==

Similarly to explorer.exe, the Microsoft Internet Explorer, iexplore.exe, can also be extended by creating a '''Browser Helper Object''' (BHO). A BHO may be a single toolbar button, an entire toolbar, or even any number of other objects in the browser. BHOs are generally programmed using C++.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comparison of the two religions==
===Hinduism===
*Hinduism is one of the oldest religions of the world, renowned for its outlook of the philosophy and higher thinking. While the origins of Hinduism, normally called as Sanatana Dharma or Vedic dharma, are unknown ,it is more clearly marked for its inclusiveness- it appropriates all streams of deities and thoughts including those of atheism and Tantric nature. But it has been largely accepted that Hinduism thrives on monotheism.The  distinguishing features of Hinduism from other religions of the world are its deep philosophical thought(it has as many as six main divisions of philosophy grown over the last several thousands of years), a well developed ritualistic tradition along with huge families of hymns, specific social order,  beliefs in Karma theory and rebirth and finally, the belief that the ultimate purpose of man being here is to realize the Self .  The God pictured by Hinduism is a Parabrahman on one hand who is  highly apersonal and merely abides by the cosmological laws and order he himself had ordained and a personal God, sweet, compassionate and nursing and caring on the other hand. Worshiping the Parabrahman in the form of your personal God  can not only secure you good life in this world but also, can take you forward in your spiritual sojourn towards your ultimate goal of realizing the Self. Practiced by almost a billion people worldwide, it has been often a target of invaders, who kept up their attacks in the name of religion. The evolution of Hinduism can be traced from Ritualistic Vedism to philosophy to  much more later date's Bhakti Movement (the movement of Devotion to your personal God.    

===Christianity===
* Christianity is belief in the Creator God corroborated by testimony, plus signs and marvels and various mighty works by his self-proclaimed Son, confirming this declaration with his resurrection from the dead, Jesus of Nazareth, over 2000 years ago with the resultant world wide church guided by gifts (Hebrews 2: 4) of the Holy Spirit distributed in accordance with the will of God.
*Love in Christianity is the first fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5: 22) to include joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness and faith, all to inherit the kingdom of God and by love especially to serve one another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Screensavers are graphical programs that will exercise the computer's screen while the computer is not in use, to prevent damage to the screen. Screensavers can also be very aesthetic, interesting, and entertaining however.

== Requirements ==

Screensaver programs are essentially normal executable programs, with a few small differences:

#They have a .scr extension, instead of a .exe
#They have a ScreenSaverProc, instead of a WindowProc.
#They call DefScreenSaverProc, instead of DefWindowProc.

Also, screensavers must contain a configuration dialog box, that the shell can call when you click on the screensaver and select &quot;properties&quot;. The last requirement is that a screensaver must have a string resource, at resource 1, with a description of the screensaver. 

== How they Work ==

Windows will send a number of different arguments to a screensaver, on the commandline, depending on what mode of operation the screensaver must take. Here are some of them:

*/a &lt;hwnd&gt;
*/s
*/c &lt;hwnd&gt;
*/p &lt;hwnd&gt;

The -a option tells the screensaver program to set the associated password, if the screensaver is selected to be password protected. The -s option tells the screensaver to run the graphics, and start saving the screen. The -c option tells the screensaver to display the configuration dialog, and the -p option tells the screensaver to run in preview mode. 

The WinMain function should decode the command line, and obtain both the switch (a, s, p, c) and the handle, if specified. The Handle value will be in an ascii string, so that will need to be converted to an integer, and stored into an appropriate HWND variable. The handle provided is the handle to the parent window of the screensaver, which is usually the screensaver tab in the Windows Display dialog box. The screensaver doesn't have a parent window if it is in screensaving mode. 

If WinMain has received a -s or a -p, the WinMain should call the ScreenSaverProc. If it has received the -c option, WinMain should call the Dialog box procedure function. If the screensaver receives the -a option, it should bring up a dialog to change the password.

== No Cream ==

I very strongly disaggree that cream should be added to tea. Adding cream gives it a strange taste somewhat similar to the taste of canned condensed milk. When I was young in England the milk sold then was not homogenised. The cream used to float to the top. Most people would pour  off the cream and use the underlying milk to add to the tea. In my opinion Cream should NEVER be added to  the tea. It spoils the taste. Even  regular homogenised milk is a bit too creamy. Tea is NOT like coffee where of course cream is prefered.
I do aggree with most of the rest of your description including the preference for loose tea over tea bags. It  is not only the flow of the water over the tea that is significant but also that in the course of manufacture of the tea bag product the tea leaves  are more finely chopped up, often almost into a powder. 

My  mother  would not have Lipton tea in the house and I am often puzzled to  to understand why so many people in the U.S. seem to  think that Earl Grey is the quintesential English Tea. Earl Grey is a tea the flavour of which has been modified by the addition of a strong spice. I personally drink tea regularly and almost never drink coffee. I find the spice in Earl Grey  over powers the tea and I do not like it.     Frank C. Jones

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Supporting Client Learning''' is a core unit in both the Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.

Further information can be obtained from '''angela.lees@sqa.org.uk'''


== ICT competence and learning goals ==


=== Establishing client competence in use of hardware and software ===


The client’s '''ICT competence''' clearly affects their ability to use any learning packages available.  If ICT skills are lacking, the client may have to undertake some '''ICT skills development''' before moving onto their selected learning package.  You should determine the client’s ICT competence in relation to both '''hardware''' and '''software'''. 


Your initial task is to find out what sorts of '''previous experience''' and '''competence''' the client has had with ICT.  Typically you might want to explore four areas:


*	'''hardware''' 

*	'''operating system environment (normally Windows)'''

*	'''using the Internet'''

*	'''using applications packages''' 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1'''

Before proceeding:	


*  List the hardware items you would enquire about.
*  Note down what you would want to know about each of these items.

----

 

==== Client competence in using hardware ====


The main items of hardware which the client is likely to have to use are the:


*	'''mouse'''
*	'''keyboard''' 
*	'''printer'''
*	'''scanner'''
*	'''removable media'''


We look at each of these in turn, giving some specific pointers about what you should ask the client.

 

==== The mouse ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Has the client used a mouse?

*	Is the client aware of the use of the '''left and right buttons'''?

*	Is the client aware of '''hovering''' over items?

*	(For left handed clients) is the client aware of how to change a mouse from right- to '''left-handed''' operation?

*	If the computers in your library use '''another type of pointing device''', such as a tracker ball or touch pad, can the client use this proficiently?


 
==== Keyboard ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*  Has the client used a keyboard?  

*  Does the client know how to use:
**	'''space and return keys'''
**	'''shift and caps lock keys'''
**	'''delete and backspace keys'''
**	'''cursor (arrow) keys '''
**	'''ctrl, tab, esc and insert keys'''
**	'''function keys'''

 

==== Printer ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Has the client used a printer?

*	Is the client aware of any printer processes which are '''specific to your library''?

*	Can the client '''load the printer with paper'''?

*	Is the client aware of the '''cost per page''' of printing (monochrome and colour)?

 

==== Scanner ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Has the client used a scanner?

*	Is the client aware of the routine of pre-scan, select area and scan?

*	Is the client aware of the importance of selecting an appropriate scanning resolution?

 

==== Removable media ====


Use of removable media, such as floppy disks, CD-ROMs and USB storage (also known as Flash Drives or Pen Drives) will be governed by library rules.  If these are allowed you might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Can the client '''insert a disk''' (or other media) properly?

*	Is the client aware of when it is appropriate to '''remove''' it?

*	Can the client access media in '''different drives'''?

*	Can the client save to '''writable media'''?


 

==== Operating systems ====

We use the term '''operating system''' to describe the basic software, such as '''Microsoft Windows''', which makes the computer work.  When a computer is switched on, the operating system starts running before any application package such as Word will run.  The operating system involves '''managing applications and data'''. 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2'''

Before proceeding:

*	List the aspects of the operating system you would enquire about.
*	Note down what would you want to know about each aspect.

----

 

==== Previous experience ====


You might want to start by finding out the following information:


*	Is the client '''familiar with the operating system''' on the computers in your library? 


Note that, even within the same library, different computers may have different operating systems. Most of the common operating systems are supplied by Microsoft:


*	Windows 98
*	Windows NT
*	Windows 2000
*	Windows Millennium
*	Windows XP


There are some significant differences in the practical operation of these, so you should determine whether the client can carry out the tasks we outline below for the operating system on the computer which will be used to work through the chosen learning packages.


 
==== Operating system tasks ====

You might want to start by finding out the following information:

'''Finding applications:'''

*	Does the client know '''where to look''' for the applications or packages?

*	Does the client know the '''names and icons''' for the applications required?


'''Opening and closing applications:'''


*	Can the client '''open''' an application?

*	Can the client '''close''' an application correctly? (This often involves saving information.)


'''Using a file manager to locate files and data: '''


*	Can the client use '''My Documents/Windows Explorer''' to navigate around the file system?

*	Is the client aware of the concept of a '''hierarchy''' or tree structure of folders (directories)?


'''Creating folders and saving data in specific folders:'''


*	Can the client '''create a new folder''' to save application data?


 

==== Using the Internet ====


A great deal of information to support learning as well as complete learning packages can be accessed via the Internet. It is therefore important to gauge the client’s competence in Internet use.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVTY 1.3'''

Before proceeding:

*	List the aspects of Internet use you would enquire about.
*	Note down what would you want to know about each aspect.

----


 

==== Common Internet tasks ====


Here are the main aspects of '''basic Internet use''' which you should ask about:


'''Browsing the Internet:'''


*	Has the client experience of '''using a browser'''? (e.g.: Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox)

*	Has the client experience of '''using a search engine'''? (e.g.: Google, Ask Jeeves)

*	Is the client aware of the variable quality of websites found on the Internet?


'''E-mail:'''


*	Has the client used '''e-mail'''?

*	Does the client have an '''e-mail address'''?


'''Chat:'''


*	Has the client used '''chat'''?

*	Is the client aware of '''possible dangers''' in its use?


'''Groups:'''


*	Has the client used any '''(news)groups'''?


 

==== Using applications packages ====


You need to know about the client’s existing experience with common applications packages.  This will help to confirm the information gleaned so far.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.4'''

Before proceeding, list some applications packages you might want to ask about.

----


 
==== Applications packages ====


Word processing is the most likely example of an applications package.  Almost all computer users will have done some word processing.  But many will have used other packages as well.


'''Word processing packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''word processor'''? (e.g.: Word, Write)


'''Spreadsheet packages'''


* Has the client used a '''spreadsheet application'''? (e.g.: Excel) 


'''Photo/Graphics packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''photo/graphics package'''? (e.g.: Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop)


'''Database packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''database application'''? (e.g.: Access, dBASE)


'''Financial packages'''


*	Has the client used a '''financial package'''? (e.g.: Quicken, Quick Books)


'''Other'''


*	Has the client used any other, '''more specialised packages''' which do not fit into the above categories? If so, what are these packages and what do they do?


In each case you should try to get an idea of the '''level''' at which the packages have been used.  The best way of finding this out is to ask the client to give some '''examples''' of how they used the package.

==== Using learning packages ====


One important question to ask is whether the client wishes to use the chosen learning package '''in the library''', using the library’s equipment, or whether they would prefer to take the package away for '''home''' use. 

If the latter, it is vital that you establish the '''specification''' of their home computer.  While many home users possess high specification equipment, others may have older, slower models which will not support the latest packages.  This can be a particular problem where '''graphics or audio''' is involved.  

All learning packages will state clearly the '''minimum specification''' on which the application will run and you should ask the client to confirm that their home equipment meets or exceeds this.

It is good practice to make a '''written record''' of what you have established about the client’s ICT competence.  Some libraries have checklists for this purpose. 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.5'''

Find out if your library service has checklists of this nature.  If not, why not create one for yourself and your colleagues to use?

----

 

==== Establishing learning goals ====


You need to '''establish the learning goals''' for the client before you can think about possible learning approaches.  The client may have learning goals related to their '''work''' or to their '''personal life'''.  You should attempt to establish exactly what the client wishes to learn and if possible get an idea of the reasons why the client is undertaking the learning. 

Some clients may come to the public library seeking learning packages which are '''complete in themselves'''.  You may be able to provide such packages “off the shelf” in your library or you may have to source them from elsewhere.

Other clients may be seeking additional learning to support training or education being '''undertaken elsewhere'''.  The most obvious example of the latter is school pupils or college/university students wishing assistance with assignments or desiring materials which will help them revise for examinations.  

Clients engaged in more '''informal learning''' may also require top-up materials.  For example, an adult working through a self-help book on word processing might ask for additional exercises in keyboarding.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.6'''

Before proceeding outline the different areas you would need to ask about to find out the client’s learning goals.  There are quite a few of them!

----

==== Determining learning goals ====


Here are some possible areas to look at with the client to determine the learning goals:


'''General subject area:'''

What is the '''general subject area''' in which the client wishes to undertake the learning? 
E.g.: the Spanish language.


'''Slant or specialism:'''

Is there a '''particular specialism''' to this learning? E.g.: Spanish for business.


'''Existing competence of client:'''

Does the client possess any existing relevant competence in the subject? E.g.: the client has picked up a basic knowledge while living in Spain for six months last year.


'''Future competence as a result of the learning undertaken:'''

What '''level''' does the client wish to be able to reach as a result of the learning? E.g.: the client wishes to write business letters to Spanish clients of their company.


'''Reasons for learning:'''

Is there a particular work or social '''reason''' the client has for wishing to undertake the learning? E.g.: the client is soon to take responsibility for their company’s Spanish clients


==== Additional factors ====


You may need to consider the following additional factors:


'''Timeframe: '''

Over what '''time period''' does the client wish the learning to take place?  E.g.: the next six months. 


'''Time available:'''

'''How much time''' in the week does the client have for learning? E.g.: up to four hours per week.


'''Importance of certification:'''

Does the client particularly want to undertake learning which will result in a '''qualification?'''  E.g.: the client is interested in gaining a City &amp; Guilds qualification in Business Spanish on completion of the learning.


'''Finance:'''

Many of the learning materials available through public libraries will have no costs attached. However some may involve '''enrollment or certification fees'''. In these cases, you must tactfully investigate if the client would have the financial resources for a course of study with a fee associated? E.g.: is the client able and/or willing to pay for an end of course examination fee?


It is good practice to make a '''written record''' of what you have established about the client’s learning goals. Some libraries have checklists for this purpose. 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.7'''

Find out if your library service has checklists of this nature.  If not, why not create some for yourself and your colleagues to use?

----

=== The UK education and training system ===


In order to help your clients, you need to have a broad-based understanding of the '''UK education and training system '''as a whole - '''pre-school, primary, secondary, tertiary, workplace''' and '''informal'''. Naturally you are not expected to be an expert on education and training (although in some instances you may need to consult such experts).  However you should be familiar with the basics of the system and know how to find out more detail on any aspect, if this is required. 

Remember that we live in an age of '''lifelong learning''' and that much learning takes place outside the traditional academic system.  So you should make sure that you know not just the local schools, colleges and universities, but also private training providers, adult learning agencies, voluntary groups etc.

In particular, it is essential that you appreciate the ways in which the education and training systems of the four UK nations differ from one another (the Scottish system displays the largest divergences from the others) and the implications of this for the client. 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.8 '''

Here are the official government websites for the education departments in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales:


*England:		http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/
*Northern Ireland:	http://www.deni.gov.uk/  and http://www.delni.gov.uk/
*Scotland:		http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/
*Wales:			http://www.learning.wales.gov.uk/


Familiarize yourself with the information provided on these sites, especially that related to the country in which you are resident. Note that much of the information on the English site applies also to Wales and some is also applicable to Northern Ireland.Each of these sites provides links to sites giving information on more specialised aspects of education.  Note the addresses of such sites which are particularly relevant to yourself and summarise the sort of information which you can gain from them.

=== Ascertaining special needs ===


You should establish any special needs (in the widest sense) of the client which will have a bearing on the learning they are proposing to undertake. 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.9'''

Before proceeding:

*	Make a list of the different types of special needs which could have a bearing on the learning.
*	For each case note the steps you can take to enable the learning.

----

 

==== Types of special needs ====


It is difficult to compile a comprehensive list of special needs.  Here are some of the most common with some suggestions as to how the library can facilitate learning for such clients.


*	'''Motor disabilities'''

*	'''Visual impairment'''

*	'''Hearing impairment'''

*	'''Special learning needs''' (including literacy, numeracy and English as a second language)

 

==== Motor disabilities ====


This can cover a wide range of disabilities, ranging from a paraplegic learner in a wheelchair to someone with mild Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).  Some common examples of library facilities for this group are:


*	a '''flexible computer desk''' at a height which can be adjusted to suit varying dimensions of wheelchairs

*	a '''joystick or specially adapted mouse''' for clients who cannot operate a standard mouse

*	a '''specialised “big keys” keyboard''' etc. for clients who cannot operate a standard keyboard

*	a '''mouse tray''' so that clients can use the mouse on their lap

*	'''touch screens'''

*	'''programmable keypads''' to reduce the number of keystrokes required for common inputs

 

==== Visual impairment ====


Many manufacturers produce software specifically to enable use by '''visually impaired users'''.  It is possible for the '''users''' to hear what appears on the screen.  Some software produces output in '''Braille'''.

Sometimes '''simple measures''' can be effective in facilitating use by visually impaired clients, such as:


*	changing the '''text size''' on the screen

*	altering the '''colour settings''' (It is usually easiest for clients with visual impairments to read black text on a white background)

*	using '''“text only”''' versions where graphics are removed.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.10'''

Make sure that you can carry out the three “simple measures” listed above.

Useful information can be found on the website of the '''Royal National Institution for the Blind'''. Go to http://www.rnib.org.uk/ and search for “internet”.

----

 

==== Hearing impairment ====


Again much '''specialist software''' is available.  Libraries can install systems which pick up sound from the computer through an amplifier and radio microphone which is then transmitted by infrared around the room.  The hearing impaired person hears this amplified sound through a lightweight headset. There is no need for users to wear their hearing aids. 


http://www.deafclub.co.uk is a useful site with a search engine, which is specifically designed to help deaf people find information.  It can also lists sites giving advice on ICT adaptations for clients with hearing impairment.  


http://www.rnid.org.uk/  is the site of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People.


 
==== Special learning needs ====


Public libraries have always played an important role in assisting clients in these groups and recent '''disability and discrimination legislation''' has laid even more emphasis on this role.  

Research has shown that libraries are often viewed by such clients as '''friendly, non-judgmental environment'''s.  In consequence they may be more likely to undertake learning in the library than in the more formal setting of a school or college.

Your library service will have staff who specialise in assisting these user groups.  These colleagues can advise you of how best to provide for individual clients. 

You should be aware that nowadays, there are many '''holistic learning packages''' which provide upskilling for young people or adults in literacy, numeracy and ICT. 

Remember that, although the word processor’s '''spell checking facility''' is designed primarily to check for typing errors, it is an invaluable aid to anyone with problems in coping with the English language’s idiosyncratic spelling.



=== Sources of careers information ===


In order to match the client’s learning desires with work goals, it may be necessary to have information about which '''workplace qualifications and competences''' are useful in a particular job role or career.  You are not expected to know this information but you should to be able to access it efficiently, most probably by use of the Internet.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.11'''

Before proceeding, find websites which will give you information on the following careers:

*	nursing
*	clockmaking
*	actuarial work
*	farriery

----
 

==== Careers information sites ====


There are several different sites which will produce the required information. There is usually a dedicated site for each '''sector of employment'''.

Here are some examples for the jobs we asked about:


'''Nursing'''

An NHS site  http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/careers/nursing/ 


'''Clockmaking'''

The British Horological Institute   http://www.bhi.co.uk/ 


'''Actuarial work'''

Prospects the graduate careers website has a section at: http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;idno=329&amp;pageno=1 


'''Farriery'''

The Farriers Registration Council has a section on careers at:
http://www.farrier-reg.gov.uk/

==== General careers information ====


There are several useful on-line sources of general careers information, such as:


*'''For England	'''		http://www.connexions-direct.com
*'''For Scotland'''		http://www.careers-scotland.org.uk
*'''For Wales'''		http://www.careerswales.com/
*'''For the whole of the UK'''	http://www.careers-gateway.co.uk

== Select a range of ICT-based packages to support learning ==


=== Selection criteria ===


You must take all the information obtained from the client into account so that you can '''identify learning packages''' which will meet the criteria.  You will match learning packages against such criteria as:


*	Does the '''subject matter''' match the client’s desired study topic?

*	Is '''certification''' available if the client desires this?

*	Does the '''length''' of the learning package fit with the time available for the client to learn?

*	Can the client afford any '''costs''' associated with the learning?

*	Does the learning package address any '''special needs''' of the client?

*	Is the level of the learning suitable in terms of both '''starting competence''' (i.e.: neither too easy nor too difficult) and '''final competence''' achieved at the end of learning?

*	Can the client undertake this learning without enhancement of their existing ICT skills? If not, can the library supply additional support for '''ICT skills development''' in order to enable the client to undertake the chosen learning package?


 
=== Learning packages available within own organisation ===


You need to be aware of the range of learning packages which are available within your own library service.  Some of these will be at your own service point.  Others will be held elsewhere within the service.

The library catalogue will give information about the learning packages, both in your own library and elsewhere.  Some libraries produce '''specific catalogues''' or lists of ICT learning packages, giving more details than might be found in the general catalogue.  For packages at your own service point, it is also useful to examine the packages themselves and, if time permits, you can actually test them out.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1'''

Familiarise yourself with all the catalogues and lists of ICT learning packages in your library service.  Note what sort of information they provide for each item.

----
 


==== Restrictions on the use of learning packages ====


You must be able to determine any restrictions on the use of ICT learning packages, e.g.:


*	Must the package be used on '''library premises''' or is it available for '''home use'''?

*	Is there a limit to the '''number of hours''' a client may book to use the package in the library or on the length of time a package can be borrowed? 

*	If the packages are to be used in the client’s home it is vital for you to establish the details of the '''client’s own computer''' in order to be sure that the specification is high enough to support the chosen learning package.


When working in this area you will pick up useful information through the experience and comments of clients.  If several clients recommend a particular package on keyboarding techniques, for instance, you can feel confident in recommending it to other clients with similar learning goals.  Additionally you can gain information and advice through discussions with experienced colleagues.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2'''

Here is an exercise to familiarise yourself with some learning packages available within your own library service.For each subject area given below, find two packages and note the differences between them:


*	Business studies
*	French language
*	Basic mathematics
*	Word processing

----

 

=== Sourcing learning packages outside own organisation ===


Your library cannot duplicate all the learning packages which will exist locally outside your library service.  You must have an awareness of what is available out there.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3'''

Before proceeding make a list of the types of organisation in your locality which produce and/or deliver learning packages.

----

 

==== Sources of learning packages ====


Here are some examples of where learning might be found in the locality:

*	'''Schools'''

*	'''Further education colleges'''

*	'''Universities'''

*	'''Private trainers'''

*	'''Local learning partnerships'''

*	'''Community learning'''

*	'''Voluntary organisations''', e.g.: Workers’ Educational Association


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''


Here is an exercise to increase your familiarity with local sources of learning material outside the library service.  


Choose four of the types of provider given in the preceding list.  For each type, find the website of a named organisation in this category and choose two different study packages offered. Note the differences between the packages at each organisation and the differences between the organisations.

----


 
==== Differences between sources ====


We expect that you will find the following points of difference:


*	'''Cost of package (if any)'''

*	'''Flexibility of study times'''

*	'''Availability of certification'''

*	'''Level of studies'''

*	'''Range of content'''
 
 
In fact, you should come up with the very points which might be criteria gleaned from a client seeking learning.


With e-learning it is not necessary for the provider to be local.  Much excellent learning content can be sourced free of charge from the Internet e.g.: http://www.studyspanish.com   offers free tuition in basic Spanish.  In other cases e-learning may be delivered via the Internet for a fee.  In these cases a '''log in''' and '''password''' will be required after registration.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.5'''

Before proceeding, find and note down five websites where learning is available on the Internet.

----

=== Learning on the Internet ===


Learning can be found on the Web at many, many sites.  There is no way that you will be able to remember even a fraction of these.  So it is extremely important that you should be familiar with sites which are commonly used to '''find learning resources'''.  Check these sites frequently for news and developments, as their content is regularly updated. 


It is important to be aware of the scope of any such site.  It is often the case that learning sites which appear to be '''UK-wide''' are not in fact applicable to one or more of the four nations.  Frequently, learning sites apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland (e.g.: http://www.learndirect.co.uk) and there is a separate site for Scotland (e.g.: http://www.myworldofwork.co.uk) 
 

The scope is not always obvious from the title of the site. Be especially careful when the word &quot;national&quot; is used. This can mean UK or a single one of the four UK nations. For example, the content of the National Learning Network (http://www.nln.ac.uk) applies only to England.  In contrast, the content of the '''National Learning Network''' (http://www.nln.ac.uk) applies only to England. 


 
==== BBC learning materials ====


The BBC (http://www.bbc.co.uk) offers excellent learning materials most of which are applicable in all four UK nations.  This site also provides links to '''other providers''' of on-line learning.


There are many websites which are specifically designed to provide '''curriculum related resources and revision aids'''.  Once again it is vital to check that these are appropriate for the school or college curriculum of the UK nation where the client is studying.  The BBC’s site (http://www.bbc.co.uk) has educational and revision material for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 


You should be familiar with websites applicable to your own home nation’s educational curriculum, such as Learning and Teaching Scotland (http://www.ltscotland.org.uk).  However, do not consider that support learning should be confined to these educational web sites.  Rather be prepared to assist clients to find appropriate support material for their learning from any suitable Internet source.  This applies especially when the client is seeking information to '''enhance a course''' of study undertaken elsewhere.  They may come to the library looking for company financial performance data to include in a presentation on marketing, literary criticism of T S Eliot for a university essay or information on the breeding habits of dolphins for A level biology.  


This sort of information in support of learning will probably be found on websites which are not specifically educational.  So be prepared to assist your client to find information in support of their learning from '''any appropriate Internet''' source.

=== Devising a learning plan ===


You can give the client additional help in the form of a motivational learning plan to guide the learner through the package(s) you have sourced.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.6'''
 	

Before proceeding, make a list of points which you might include in the plan.

----

 

==== Contents of a learning plan ====


A suitable set of features to be included in the learning plan is:


*	the overall learning goal

*	specific learning objectives which contribute to the learning goal

*	a deadline for completion of the learning

*	a schedule for learning

*	any support which the library staff have agreed to provide for the client

*	a specification of the responsibilities and involvement of any outside provider


The learning plan is best expressed in SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timebound) objectives.  It need not be a complex piece of documentation.  Often it can simply be a checklist.

This plan should be created with and agreed by the client.  Usually it will be signed by both the client and a member of library staff.

The use of such a learning plan avoids confusion and can also be motivating to the learner. Where the client is returning to learning after a gap, or has had prior negative learning experiences, it can be helpful to break the learning into “bite sized chunks” and produce a series of shorter learning plans.  Thus the client has a positive experience of successfully completing a small amount of learning which engenders a sense of achievement and spurs them on to further efforts.


 
==== Example of a learning plan ====

[[Image:2Learning Plan.png|500px]]

=== Progression opportunities ===

An important role of the public library is to be a key player in lifelong learning.  A '''positive learning experience''' provided by the library can lead to further successful progression for the client, in some cases into formal tertiary or workplace vocational education.  The library user who enquires about opportunities to study Spanish language to further her career in retail sales may eventually undertake a university course in business and retail management. 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.7'''


Before proceeding note down how you might explore progression opportunities for a client.

----

 

==== Exploring progression opportunities ====


You could explore the following possibilities:


*	What has been the '''client’s experience''' with the learning undertaken so far?  Have they enjoyed it?  What was particularly enjoyable or useful and what was less so? 

*	Revisit the client’s '''original reasons''' for undertaking the learning.  Are these motivations still the same or has the experience of learning awakened the client’s ambition to broader horizons?  It is not uncommon, for example, for a learner who has embarked on a short language package, with a view to being able to order food and ask directions on holiday, to be seized with enthusiasm and wish to carry on to GCSE or Standard Grade qualifications in the language.  Based on this discussion you can consider any or all or the following:

**	Is there a '''more advanced package''' on this topic available?

**	Are there packages on '''related topics''' to that being undertaken by the client?

**	Has the client come to the end of the possible informal learning on the topic and might now proceed to '''formal education'''?

**	Which further learning will further '''enhance the client’s job prospects''' after the present studies?


Of course, all of the previously mentioned sources of information on learning provision are useful to you not only in '''sourcing learning''' which is appropriate for the client’s immediate learning goals but also to '''suggest further learning options''' to the client, on completion of the initial learning. In other words, at its simplest, when you are sourcing learning material, you should always have your eye on the level above, to see how your client might further progress.



==== Concluding the learning experience ====


Hopefully the learning has been a '''positive experience''' for the client and they are interested in taking things further.  But do not be discouraged if the client does not want to sign up for further learning immediately.  It may be that the learning just completed has achieved all the client’s current goals and they wish to pause at this point meantime.  This is a '''satisfactory outcome''' because you can be sure that a satisfied client who has found the package stimulating and relevant is likely to return to the library in future looking for advice and guidance on other learning.



== Provide appropriate ICT support to the client ==


=== Using in-house learning packs to develop ICT skills ===


Most public library services have a wealth of '''in-house learning packs''' whose aim is to develop ICT skills, ranging from beginner to advanced level.  You should examine the packages in your library so that you are completely familiar with their '''content''' and '''level'''.  This enables you to make the most informed choice when recommending a package to a client and to be absolutely confident that the client will benefit from it.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1''' 	

Select three in-house packages which develop basic ICT skills such as:


*	Using PC hardware
*	Using files and folders (directories)
*	Using the Internet
*	Keyboarding skills


Try out each of the three packages to evaluate:


*	Level (absolute beginner to expert user)
*	Duration (how many hours to work through whole package)
*	Approach (friendly to overly formal)
*	Ease of use
*	Presentation (is it attractive and encouraging for the learner?)

----



=== Front-line client support ===


When a client is using any ICT based learning package in the library, whether to develop ICT skills or for other learning, it is likely that from time to time some '''technical snags''' will arise.


You must be able to assist with straightforward trouble shooting e.g.: printing problems.  We stress the word “straightforward”.  There is no suggestion that you should possess sophisticated trouble shooting skills: this is the responsibility of ICT technical staff.  Rather you should be acquainted with typical, straightforward difficulties which can arise and be able to suggest how these can be overcome. 


Do be clear about the '''boundary''' between your responsibilities regarding trouble-shooting and when to call on the services of a technical professional.


You probably have had experience of this already.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Before proceeding, note down a few possible problems which may be encountered by clients using computers. (If this is outside your own experience ask colleagues to suggest computer problems they have solved for clients.)

----



=== Typical problems ===


Here are some of the problems you are most likely to encounter.  


*	The monitor '''appears blank'''

*	After using the computer for some time, it '''‘hangs’''', neither keyboard nor mouse appear to operate

*	A client has difficulty reading off the monitor because the '''print is too small'''

*	'''Nothing''' comes out of the printer

*	The printer does not seem to use the whole of the sheet of paper and the '''layout''' is not the same as on the monitor

*	When saving data from an Office application like Word, the message comes up that the '''disk is full'''

*	The printer '''jams'''

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3'''

Before proceeding, jot down any ideas you have about the help you would be able to give in each of the above cases. You can compare this with our suggestions on the following screens.

You will find that with experience and in discussion with your colleagues you will build up a fund of solutions for these types of problem.

Once again, as in Outcome 2, you must take full cognisance of any special needs of the client and offer appropriate technical support to address these.

----

  

==== Resolving problems ====


Some of our solutions are based on your ability to '''change computer settings'''.  It may be that you do not have access rights to these and would need to contact an ICT professional.

Note that with the first two faults (monitor blank, computer hanging), if they require forcing an application to end or indeed resetting or restarting the computer, it will always mean '''any data not saved will probably be lost'''.  It is important to explain this to the client. 

It is even more important to explain before any incident occurs that '''data should be saved at regular and frequent intervals''' just in case something goes wrong!

 

==== The monitor appears blank ====


*	Check to see if the computer has '''gone to sleep''' by pressing the space bar on the keyboard.
*	Check that the monitor is '''switched on and connected''' to the mains, i.e.: is the power light illuminated?
*	Check that the monitor is correctly '''connected to the computer'''.
*	Check to see if the system works after the computer is '''reset''' or switched off at the mains and on again.


==== The computer hangs ====


Sometimes, after using the computer for some time, it '''hangs''', and neither keyboard nor mouse appears to operate. If this happens you can try the following


*	Wait a while to see if the computer is performing some '''intensive task''' and recovers.
*	Try ''Ctrl-Alt-Del''.  If you are lucky it will bring up a '''Task Manager''' window which will show you which application is not responding and allow you to close down only that application.
*	Use the '''reset button''' to restart the computer.
*	'''Switch the computer off''' at the mains and then on again.

 

==== A client has difficulty reading off the monitor because the print is too small ====


*	If this is confined to a '''particular application''', it is usually possible to adjust the '''zoom setting'''.  If this does not appear in a box near the top of the window, it will be found in the menu system under View: ''Zoom'' or ''View: Text size''.

*	If this applies to '''everything on the monitor''', then, if you have access rights, you can change the '''monitor settings'''.  Right click with the mouse on the desktop, choose ''Properties'' from the resulting menu, choose the ''Settings'' tab from the dialogue box, reduce the ''Screen resolution'' setting and ''OK''.  Unfortunately, the lower the screen resolution, the less can be displayed on the monitor.  This often results in an uneasy compromise for people with problems with their sight.



==== Nothing comes out of the printer ====


*	Check that the printer is '''switched on and connected to the mains''', i.e.: is the power light illuminated?
*	Check that the printer is correctly '''connected to the computer'''.
*	Check that the printer has '''paper''' in it.
*	Check the '''ink supply'''.
*	Try printing a '''test page'''.
*	Check the print settings in both the '''operating system''' and the '''application''' to see that the computer is looking for the correct printer and that the correct size of paper has been selected and that manual/auto (as appropriate) is chosen.


 
==== Print layout is incorrect ====


Sometimes the printer does not seem to use the whole of the sheet of paper or the layout is not the same as on the monitor.

*	When using a word processor like Word, it is possible to set the paper size in the '''application'''.  However there is also a setting for the printer itself.  If these two settings are different, then the output will not appear correctly on the page.  The driver for a newly connected '''printer''' may default to US legal for the paper size.  It is normal to use A4 in this country and applications will use this as default.  Go to the printer properties and check the paper size.  ''Start: Settings: Printers'': right click on the printer concerned, choose ''Properties'' and select the ''Device settings'' tab.



==== The disk appears to be full ====


Sometimes, when saving data from an Office application like Word, a message comes up that the disk is full.

*	It may be that the client’s '''floppy disk or pen drive is full'''.  This is quite likely for any sizable word-processed document especially if it contains graphics or other embedded items.

*	A fault condition can arise concerning interaction between the application and the operating system which results in a '''false reporting''' of the disk full error.  This is irretrievable and requires the computer to be rebooted.  If the client will lose a fair amount of unsaved data, it is worth opening a new document and copy and pasting from the original to the new document and then trying to save that.  You may be lucky!

*	A similar problem can occur regarding the computer '''running out of memory'''.  Again only rebooting the computer will correct the situation.

 

==== The printer jams ====


*	There is no universal solution for this problem as each printer has its own unique mechanism.  The best you can do is to familiarise yourself with the various types of printer in your library and how to un-jam each.


 
=== Referring clients to sources of support external to library ===


Where no suitable in-house packages are available, you will need to refer the client to '''external sources'''.  These are likely to be hands on, practical courses from local providers.  The knowledge of local provision outlined under Outcome 2 will enable you to suggest appropriate referral agencies.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4''' 	


Before proceeding, make a list of the types of packages which are not available from your library service and would need to be sourced from outside.

----

 

==== External sources of support ====


As in Outcome 2 you will find ICT skills packages in the locality from:


*	'''Schools'''

*	'''Colleges'''

*	'''Universities'''

*	'''Private trainers'''

*	'''Local learning partnerships'''

*	'''Community learning'''

*	'''Voluntary organisations, e.g.: Workers’ Educational Association'''

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.5''' 	

Here is an exercise to increase your familiarity with sources of ICT skills materials outside the library service.  

Choose four of the types of provider given in the preceding list.  For each, find the organisation’s website.  Locate at each two different ICT skills packages being offered. Note any differences between the packages at the different organisations.

You should repeat this exercise for ICT learning packages available over the Internet from providers outside your own locality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Level 7 PDA''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Level 8 PDA''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Using ICT in Professional Practice''' is a core unit in both the Diploma and Advanced Diploma programmes.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the '''Level 7''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Level 8''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.

You will have received '''on-site training''' allowing you to develop specific operational knowledge of your library management system. This might have been provided by the '''supplier''', the '''systems manager''' or other library staff.

In some cases your job role may not allow you to get practice in all of the operations we describe in this Outcome.  If this is the case, you must at least understand what is going on and see '''demonstrations''' of the operation.  As an example, relatively few staff may actively add new items to the catalogue but it will help your understanding of the operation of the system as a whole if you can observe new items being added. 

You should know where to find information or instructions on '''procedures''' relating to the use of the library management system.  If necessary you can create some “crib guides”.


---- 	

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1''' 

You should have a good knowledge and understanding of the system and its workflows.   As an exercise, taking a typical item, such as a work of fiction, draw up a flow chart which lists what happens at each stage from stock selection, through the ordering and acquisitions process, to the point when the item is made publicly available and is visible on the catalogue.

----
 


==== Borrower information ====


The two main elements in an automated system are the '''borrowers''' and the '''stock items'''.  The basic information held on the borrower, apart from name, is address and contact details.  There are usually several classes of borrower.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2''' 

Before proceeding, jot down the different classes of borrower you are aware of, and what the key differences are between them as far as the automated system is concerned.

----

 

==== Types of borrower ====


The '''main categories of borrower''', common to most public libraries, are: 


*adult
*teen
*junior
*concession (e.g.: senior citizen, person in receipt of benefits)
*disability (e.g.: visually or hearing impaired)
*housebound
*temporary (e.g.: transient worker)


You may have noted others.  


The key differences are likely to be:


*limits on the '''type of items allowed''', e.g.: junior borrowers may not borrow adult stock without a parent’s permission
*different '''loan periods''' for different categories of borrower, e.g.: no limit on length of loan period for borrowers with disabilities
*the '''scale of fines''' may vary with the different classes of borrower, e.g.: no fines for concessionary borrowers.


 
==== Registering and removing borrowers ====


The precise details of '''registering and removing borrowers''' can vary significantly depending on the system in use at your location.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.3''' 

Note down the steps you need to go through to:

*register a borrower with the system.
*remove a borrower from the system.

----

In addition to the borrower details which are permanently on the system, it may be necessary from time to time to add a '''temporary message''' to alert members of staff to something connected with a particular borrower. Some of these messages may be added automatically by the system. Typical would be information about money owed by or due to the borrower.


Staff will also be able to add specific messages. 

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down some examples of messages which you might wish to add about borrowers.

----

 

==== Messages about borrowers ====


You might want to ask for some of the '''borrower data''' to be verified, e.g.: if you have tried unsuccessfully to contact the borrower by telephone, you could add a note asking for the telephone number to be checked. Other data which sometimes changes (and borrowers neglect to inform the library) are home address and e-mail address.


Messages could be of a more '''personal''' nature “Mrs Jones left her umbrella in the library on her last visit. It is in the lost property cupboard.” Or “Tell Mr O’Neill that we have got some good new stock in about the Atkins diet.”  With these sorts of messages, do be careful to keep them factual. Data protection legislation means that borrowers are entitled to read any information stored in a computer about themselves. 


Remember to '''delete''' these messages once they are no longer applicable. Mr O’Neill will be pleased to be told once about the Atkins diet books but he will not appreciate being reminded of them on every visit to the library!

=== The circulation module ===


'''Issuing''' and '''discharging''' items of library stock using an automated system is usually quick and straightforward. Sometimes the system will indicate a complexity in the transaction, e.g.: you are prevented from issuing an item to a borrower. Although in almost all cases the system will supply you with correct information regarding the status of the borrower and their borrowing activities, the underlying reasons may not be displayed on the screen.  


However, you have to be able to explain the actions of the system to the borrower.  This requires both an excellent understanding of the library authority rules (which guide the system) and the ability to access quickly the required screens of the system to find the reasons for the system’s decisions.


You should have a good '''understanding''' and have had '''practice''' in the main operations of the circulation module of the system.  


'''Issuing items'''


This is the basic action of entering the issuing details, i.e.: borrower and item barcodes on to the system.  

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down problems that may occur with this task.

----



==== Problems with issuing ====


We can think of several problems, such as:


*With '''self-issuing systems''', where the borrower is able to carry out self-issue over the Internet, borrowers, especially if they are inexperienced in doing this, can easily make a mistake.
*The system indicates that the borrower’s '''lending limit''' has been reached.
*The borrower would like at this point to know '''which other items''' they have out on loan.
*Different classes of items may have different '''loan periods''', e.g.: DVDs may need to be returned within three days. Certain types of book may be lent for only one week instead of the general three weeks.  The system may prompt you about this but you have to remember use the correct date stamp on the item.


You must be able to deal with these situations and be aware of relevant '''library policies''' so that you can communicate quickly with the borrower and explain the reason for any problems.

 

==== Discharging items ====


Most automated systems allow items to be discharged by entering only the '''item barcode'''. They do not require borrower information to be entered. This makes discharging items a simple and fast operation. However, '''additional steps''' are sometimes required.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down problems that may occur when discharging items.

----

 

==== Problems with discharging items ====


We can think of several potential problems, such as:


*The returned item is '''damaged'''. This must be shown on the system and the book sent for repair or disposal.
*The returned item is subject to a '''request by another borrower''' or an inter-library loan. The system will prompt on this and you must follow reservation or ILL procedures.

 

==== Other circulation tasks ====


*'''Renewing items:''' this is a variation on the issuing procedure.  However, it may be a renewal over the telephone.  This requires you to manually input the details into the system.
*'''Reserving Items:''' make sure that you are familiar with the steps you must carry out on the system to input a reservation.
*'''Overdues:''' most automated systems generate overdue notices automatically and the screen will show any fine incurred by the borrower at the point of return of the item.
*'''Charges and Fines:''' reservations often require charges to be made to the borrower.  Charges may also be made for interlibrary loans.  The other common financial transaction is related to fines for late return of items.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.4''' 

Make a list of the charges your library make to borrowers which must be administered via the library's automated system.

----


Data provided by the circulation control module of the automated management system can make a significant contribution to the successful management of stock. Used properly, the system can provide data on usage for managers to support their decisions in areas such as stock selection policy, opening hours, staffing levels, distribution of stock and information for statutory and local performance indicators. A particular use of the library management system is in monitoring the performance (levels of issuing of resources) of existing stock.


=== The acquisitions module ===


Once new stock to be purchased for the library has been selected (the selection process is covered in outcome two of this unit) the automated system plays a prominent part. Although details will differ, there are three clear steps - '''ordering, receipting''' and '''invoicing'''. The system then will allow the acquisitions process to run, using its Reporting Systems and Order Transmission.
 
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.5''' 

Find out the procedures for placing and receiving stock orders on your automated library system and how this interfaces with the system’s monetary reporting facility.

----


The above are the procedural steps. However, the automated system is equally powerful in aiding the acquisition process when it comes to '''financial control'''.  


The acquisition of new items for your library stock is governed principally by an '''acquisitions policy'''. Different library authorities will have different methods but the following is the basis of the process:


*The '''total level of resources''' available for the library service as a whole is set.
*'''Priorities''' for spending are agreed.
*The total budget is then broken down across the various '''budget headings''', e.g.: fiction, non-fiction, DVDs, allocations to different branches etc.
*Budget holders are informed of their '''budget allocation''' and acquisitions may proceed.


It is important that you clearly understand the '''boundaries''' of your personal authority within the ordering of any stock selection process. You may be permitted to place orders or this may only be done by a more senior member of staff. Know what responsibility you have and your accountability for actions within your remit.


Clearly the whole process of acquisitions is based on the '''availability of funds''' to enable the purchase of new stock items.  Thus, there is always a very clearly defined method of deciding how much money can be spent on the various types of new stock item.


The joy of an automated system is that it can give really hard data to inform the acquisition process.  It will give the '''spending situation''' under the various budget headings.  This includes both the projected and the actual spending to date.  Although you may not need to access this management information, it is important for you to realise that you have a vital part in this.  You must always enter order information accurately to ensure the system has the correct data for its calculations.


Of course there is also '''non-financial information''' in the data.  For instance, it can also give information on the performance of the various suppliers used by the library. This allows the library managers to select the best performing suppliers for future orders.


=== The cataloguing and stock management modules ===


A library catalogue has two main functions:


#it is a '''record''' of the items which comprise the library stock 
#it allows people to '''seek out''' suitable items they wish to use


The first appearance of automated systems in libraries related to automation of the library catalogue.  In the late 1960s computers became powerful and available enough to allow libraries, particularly '''academic libraries''', to embark on ‘computerising’ their catalogues.  It is easy to see why this was more attractive than going for the circulation system first.  Users could use searching techniques to find book titles by keywords.  Networks were beginning to appear so that it became possible to search for titles in '''other libraries''' remotely.  You must compare this with the position up till this point of using paper or card indexes to find a book only by its author or subject.  


From the user’s point of view the cataloguing module of the automated library system is the most powerful and useful part of it.  Of course the user has to learn how to use it to advantage, as indeed do those who work in the library.


 
==== The advantages of automated catalogues ====


The advantages of automated catalogues are twofold:


#They permit sophisticated '''searching''' of the library stock.
#They link to the circulation control system so that not only can a borrower ascertain that the library service holds a particular item, they can also see its '''loan status''' at the time.


The search facility of the catalogue module is very flexible.  It will allow searching for items on author, title, accession number as well as classification.  However its greatest power for users is to search on '''subject keyword''' or '''word in title'''.  You will no doubt have to demonstrate this feature to keen users of your library.


In your administrative work related to the catalogue, i.e.: stock management, you are most likely to be locating items whose details are known.  You will be searching on author, title or accession number.  Having found the item, you may need to withdraw it, thus deleting its entry in the catalogue.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.6''' 

Note down the procedure to withdraw an item from the catalogue module of the automated library system.

----
 


==== Withdrawing items ====


Although the '''basic deletion process''' is very simple, there may be complications.  The system may require a special procedure if it is the last remaining copy of a book, or if it is an item forming part of a special collection.  Clearly your library will have its unique rules for this type of matter.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.7''' 

Ascertain the policy in your library if an item being withdrawn is shown to be the last copy of this title held within the library service.

----

==== Adding items ====


You also need to understand how resources are added to the catalogue.  In some library services, library staff undertake much of the work related to cataloguing and classifying items to be added to stock. In many other services this is done '''automatically''' using records from the supplier or downloaded from elsewhere during the order process.  However, even here, with certain items, such as donations to the library, it may be necessary to create a new record and enter all its data manually. 

---- 	

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.8''' 

Note down the procedure to manually add an item to the catalogue module of the automated library system.

----


Of course, having found the item after successfully searching the catalogue depends on knowing the layout and organisation of the particular library.  The catalogue entry will include a shelf mark.  


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down how fiction items are arranged in your library.

----

 

==== Shelving items ====


Fiction is usually arranged by author surname in alphabetical order.  Then, within any one author, by title.  Where no author exists, the editor’s surname or title is used alphabetically.


A popular method of shelving fiction is by the use of '''genres'''.  Essentially a set of genres are decided upon, e.g.: crime, fantasy, science fiction, romance and the books are labelled correspondingly and placed on the shelves in their appropriate genre.  The catalogue entry will indicate this.


Non-fiction is usually shelved by '''subject''' according to the local classification system. Here too genres may be used, e.g.: libraries frequently group all biographies together. 


Whichever methods are used, stock items are always organised according to agreed principles by libraries in order to aid the swift retrieval of resources either physically from the shelved collection or virtually from the library catalogue.

=== Inter Library Loan module ===


You should be familiar with the steps associated with the ILL process.


It may be that the borrower has a specific item in mind, in which case you must get a precise description of the item.


What information about a book would you ideally wish to have before placing an ILL request?


To satisfy the British Library ILL form, a considerable amount of information is required, indeed the full bibliographic details. In the case of a book, these are the following:


*	Author
*	Title
*	Year of publication 
*	Edition 
*	ISBN
*	Publisher &amp; place of publication 
*	The source of the reference


And remember you also need to record the name and contact details of the borrower.


If, as is likely, the borrower cannot supply you with full bibliographic details of the item being requested, you will need to ascertain these using appropriate bibliographic tools.


It may be that from the nature of the borrower request (they cannot find an item to satisfy their quest) you may need to follow the reference interview process, described in Unit 1 so that you have a clear definition of the subject area required by the borrower.    

 
==== Inter Library Loan procedures ====


Before embarking on the ILL procedure, it is always worth '''double-checking''' your own library catalogue to verify that the requested item is not actually in your stock. If it is not, your library service will have '''procurement procedures''' and appropriate ways of securing the item.  For example, this might be purchasing the item, instigating an internal ILL or carrying out an external ILL.

 	
----


[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.9''' 

Check out your library authority’s procurement procedures for securing an item which might be subject to an ILL.

----


Let us assume that an ILL will be required. The automated library system will allow the following steps to be carried out:


*	The initiation of an ILL request
*	Tracking the progress of an ILL request
*	Informing the borrower of the arrival of an inter-loaned item
*	Issuing the inter-loaned item
*	Discharging the inter-loaned item
*	Recalling an inter-loaned item
*	Recording the return of an inter-loaned item to its home library


 

==== Using Inter Library Loans ====


You should be familiar with all aspects of the Inter Library Loan system in use at your own location.

 	
----


[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.10''' 

Make yourself familiar with the Inter Library Loan module of your automated library management system for:

*Initiating an ILL request
*Monitoring progress of an ILL request 
*Carrying out internal ILL procedures for issue, discharge, recall of ILL items to client
*Carrying out procedures for receipt of and return of ILL item from/to home library.

----


You will find that the rules governing the use of ILL items will vary from those for stock items found in your own library.  It is important to be aware of these conditions and to be able to explain them to the borrower.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down some points which you think might be different for ILL items.

----

 

==== Rules governing Inter Library Loans ====


Three important points are as follows:


'''Costs:''' your library may make a charge, thus passing on some of the ILL cost to the borrower, e.g.: fines for late return - there are additional penalties for non-return of British Library items within loan period.


'''Timescales:''' you will need to give as accurate as possible an estimate of the time taken to secure the item.  Also the period of time that the borrower can hold the item may be different from the loan period for similar items in your own library stock.


'''Restrictions on use''': it may be that the item may only be consulted within your library and not borrowed.  There may be photocopying restrictions on the item.


== Use ICT sources in stock selection ==


=== Criteria for stock selection ===


Although you may not be responsible for the '''selection''' and '''acquisition''' of materials for your library, you may contribute to the identification of appropriate materials for the service.  You certainly need to understand the '''principles''' of stock selection for public libraries.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down the information you think you would need to make decisions on which stock to purchase.

----



==== Selecting stock ====


The two main drivers in stock selection are the '''current demands of the borrowers''' and the '''current stock available'''.


The current demand has to be '''audited'''.  This is relatively simple when an automated library system is being used.  In fact, it is possible to be overwhelmed by the available statistics from an automated system.  So a careful approach is required in deciding which categories, fiction genres and authors to run statistics on.


This information on borrowing can be compared with the current stock provision.  Broadly speaking there should be a match between the two.  Thus looking at the detective genre, if the books by two popular authors show a great disparity such that the books by author X are on loan five times as much as author Y, there may be a good case for purchasing more copies of the books by author X.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of circumstances where this may not be valid

----

==== Factors affecting demand ====


It would be important to take into account any '''reading promotions''' carried out by the library on author X. Another factor might be that author Y’s books are shelved in an inaccessible place. Perhaps X’s books are paperback and Y’s are hardback and your borrowers prefer the paperback format.


The conclusions on the previous page are made under the assumption that the '''stock levels, display methods''' and '''format''' are roughly the same for both authors


You also need to be aware of reading promotions external to your library which might drive a boom in borrowing books by author X.  Although it may still be valid to increase your stock because there is a genuine and sustainable increase in interest in reading author X as a result of rave reviews on a television arts programme, you do need to question the '''sustainability'''. You do not want to be left six months later with a shelf full of author X’s books which are no longer being borrowed.

 	
----


[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of other reasons for choosing items for stock apart from balancing stock and demand.

----
 


==== Additional criteria for stock selection ====


Apart from this '''balancing of stock and demand''', we think that the following points will drive stock choice. 

'''Gaps in stock''' which need to be filled.  Obvious examples are new novels by favourite authors, or earlier novels which have never been in the stock of the library. There will also be a need for '''replacement copies''' due to poor condition or because material is out of date in the case of reference items for instance.


There will also be some form of '''stock development plan''' for your library.  This may cover the need for more diverse formats, including non-book resources, as well as new directions of book materials.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1'''
 
Note down the stock development plans for your library.   If necessary ask other library colleagues.

----


All the above points go to making up the '''stock selection policy''' for your library. From this policy, it is possible to identify criteria for selection of new stock items.


It is now possible to use '''online selection tools''' to find possible new items and assess them against the agreed stock selection criteria.

 

=== Online library catalogues ===


Of the possible ways of finding suitable material for stock selection, the use of online library catalogues of other libraries has the advantage that the materials ought to be properly catalogued and so easy to find using keywords.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Online library catalogues


This ability to search other library’s catalogues is increasingly possible because it is becoming commonplace for libraries to have catalogues which can be searched via the Internet. The '''UK Public Libraries Page''' is a useful resource, linking to the web-available catalogues.

http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/ac940/weblibs.html  


Some services '''combine''' together the catalogues of several libraries. A single-search interface is used to cross-search multiple catalogues in a single search action. In Wales there is [http://library.wales.org/catcymru/ CatCymru] which enables the searching of library catalogues across all public, FE and HE libraries in Wales 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2'''
 
Go to the UK Public Libraries Page and find examples of public library services with combined catalogues. (There are several examples of this.)

----

 

==== Combined catalogues ====


Some websites combine catalogues of collections with a common theme. Here are some more examples of catalogues to explore:


*'''British Library'''		http://catalogue.bl.uk 
*'''Northern Ireland'''		http://www.ni-libraries.net/library-card/library-catalogue/
*'''CatCymru'''	                http://library.wales.org/catcymru/
*'''Birmingham'''		http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/libcat

==== Differences between catalogues ====


The catalogues we looked at on the previous page vary in the details they provide and in the range of functions which can be performed. They do however offer the opportunity to trace resources.  Here you are using the existing systems for inter-library loan as a helpful way of allowing library staff to view each other’s collections.

 
Some services may have automatic links to bibliographic service providers such as '''Talis''' or subscriptions to services such as '''Whittaker’s Books in Print'''.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3'''
 
Go to the Northern Ireland catalogue https://opac.librariesni.org.uk/ and search under author for Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code”. Look through the list and select the correct author. Follow the links and note that you can clearly see format, availability and reserve the item online. Compare this to the information available for the same book from your service.

----


QUESTION TextEntry1:

=== Publishers’ and booksellers’ websites ===


The most obvious place on the Internet to look for new stock items is of course the library booksellers’ and publishers’ websites.  These companies aim to sell the items and so one would expect that they contain the most '''up to date information''' on things like prices and publication dates for the items.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of other more negative points about the use of such websites.

----
 


==== Negative aspects to commercial sites ====


Well, you have to bear in mind that publishers and booksellers have a '''commercial imperative''' and thus the content may be biased or might not provide full information. 


You must exercise '''caution''' when using these websites to select material and you must therefore ensure that any selected materials do properly match the agreed selection criteria. 


 
==== Example sites ====


Here is a small selection of useful sites:


*'''Askews'''				http://www.askews.co.uk/site/default_askews.asp
*'''Bertram Library services'''		http://libraryservices.bertrams.com/BertramLibraryServices/
*'''Booksellers Association'''		http://www.booksellers.org.uk/
*'''Scottish Bibliographies Online'''	http://www.scotlandsculture.org/sbo/sbo.htm
*'''Welsh Books Council'''		http://www.cllc.org.uk/
*'''Books from Scotland'''		http://www.booksfromscotland.com 

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''

Go to the Harper Collins website (http://www.harpercollins.com) and follow links from the home page to New Releases, Forthcoming Titles and Best Sellers. Look for a favourite author in these sections and note the information you can find about the author, forthcoming events, full list of titles in print, range of formats titles are available in and links to author’s websites. NB: You can also register for an author tracker facility and to find out about new writing.

----

==== Services offered ====


Some of the websites offer a range of sophisticated services – pre-publication ordering facilities, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) information, download facilities of MARC (Machine Reading Catalogue) records and tracking systems for current orders.
	
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''

Choose one of your own library suppliers, view their website and make a note of the services apart from straight forward sale of items which they provide.  Find out how well they integrate with your automated library management system. You may find it useful to ask your colleagues about this.

=== Online reviews and personal evaluations ===


The Internet provides a great potential for reviewing potential new stock items.  There are many websites which will provide this sort of service.  An obvious choice is the bookseller Amazon 


However there are many others’ including sites linked to newspapers. Here are some examples:


*'''The Guardian book review site'''  	http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/ 
*'''The Independent book review site'''	http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/  

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of more negative points about the use of such websites.

----
 


==== Negative aspects of online reviews ====


You have to treat reviews which have been posted on the Internet with some caution. They often include only part of the entire review and the views of the individual reviewer are unlikely to have been through a '''rigorous editorial process''', unlike print journals.


It is also possible to review extracts of audio/visual materials using the Internet, again candidates should return to the stock selection policy for guidance prior to purchase.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''

Go to the Guardian’s website http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/  and compare one of the reviews with the book blurb on the publisher’s website or another review on the same title. Look at style, content, detail and overall conclusion of the reviews with a view to their helpfulness within stock selection.

== Use ICT in continuing library practice and professional development ==


=== Discussion lists ===


Online discussion lists (sometimes called groups, newsgroups or forums) are the Internet version of electronic '''bulletin boards''', popular among computer users long before Internet. A user can post comments on a topic and other users can respond. Messages are visible to all members of the group and some services provide extensions such as file storage and calendaring. The original newsgroup service, '''Usenet''', is now available via Google Groups (http://groups.google.co.uk). Other services include  '''Jiglu''' (http://www.jiglu.com/) and '''Yahoo Groups''' (http://groups.yahoo.com).


Discussion lists are a useful tool for both individual professional development and solving specific problems. Lists work in the following way. You have to sign up as a member, giving your e-mail address. Any of the members can send in an e-mail with information of interest to the group or a question. All these e-mails are forwarded automatically to all list members. This usually generates a flurry of helpful responses.


Some lists are '''moderated''' so that the e-mails are only posted after they have been vetted.  For the lists you use, you should be aware which are vetted and which allow e-mails to be sent instantaneously.  


We can classify discussion lists into three broad categories: 


*	professional discussion lists run by or for the professional library bodies

*	government or local government sponsored lists 

*	ad hoc lists run by interested people or groups. 

 

==== Professional discussion lists ====


JISC mail (the service provided by the Joint Information Systems Committee) is one of the key providers of discussion lists and has a number of '''public library, special interest''' and '''library profession groups'''. The home page is http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/. You can search for different lists based on topic and there are many related to libraries.


You can see a list of library categories on this page: 

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists/category/Library.html 


Three specific examples of lists which can be used for professional matters by library staff are:



*	'''LIS-PUB-LIBS:''' is a forum for discussion of issues relating to UK public libraries.  See the joining page at: http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=lis-pub-libs 

*	'''LIS-SCOTLAND:''' is a forum for discussion of issues relating to Scotland.  See the joining page at: http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?SUBED1=lis-scotland&amp;A=1 

*	'''LIS-Wales:''' is a forum for discussion of issues relating to Wales.  See the joining page at: https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=lis-wales


CILIP has a range of professional discussion lists which are targeted at supporting members of library staff who share particular professional interests or working environments. Visit http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists/category/Library.html  to browse the library dicussion lists (you can search for the CILIP sponsored discussion lists using 'LIS-CILIP').

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''
 
Select an appropriate online discussion group on a subject that interests you e.g. information literacy, youth library work or mentoring. Join a group (you will find more at http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/mailinglists) and read some of the recent discussions. 

----

==== Government sponsored lists ====


Non-library-specific discussion groups, such as those run on local authority websites or the websites of other agencies may also be useful. An example is the '''Welsh Assembly Government''' which offers a range of consultation and discussion forums (you have to register to access the forums):

http://wales.gov.uk/?lang=en 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.2''' 

Search the Internet for a discussion list for your geographic area, perhaps run by your local authority.

----

==== Ad hoc groups and lists ====


There is a range of commercial service providers such as:


 
*'''Yahoo Groups'''	http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/
*'''Jiglu'''            http://www.jiglu.com/
*'''Freeboards'''       http://www.freeboards.net/main.htm


They provide discussion groups (lists) free of charge.  These offer simple, alternative ways to start discussion lists for groups, e.g. Community Services Group (Scotland) at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/csgscotland/  Of course this also means that you can also easily set up a group to discuss any topic you choose.  This approach can allow you to share ideas in the professional field.

Social networking websites have a huge potential for useful exchanges of news, information and ideas. Many of them have established areas for library interests. The main problems are the quality of the content and access from within local authority firewalls. Here are some sites to look at, if you can access them.


*'''CILIPS'''		https://twitter.com/CILIPScotland
*'''CILIP South East Branch Flickr'''	http://www.flickr.com/photos/cilip-se/
*'''CILIP Career Development Group Facebook''' 	http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2421438148
*'''Welsh libraries blog'''		http://libalyson.wordpress.com/
*'''Del-i-cious'''
*'''Scottish libraries blog'''		http://scottishlibraries.wordpress.com/ 
*'''Scottish Library and Information Council'''		http://www.scottishlibraries.org/ which incorporates a range of web 2.0 tools. Guidance on using web 2.0 in a library and information service context have been published and are interesting reading.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3''' 

Taking any one of the three group providers mentioned above, explore how to set up a group for your own use.For all three use the group index or search system to find groups related to library work.

----

=== Professional websites ===


You should be familiar with and able to access a range of key professional websites to support you in your professional practice.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down any websites you can think of which fall into the above category.

----
 


==== Types of professional website ====


The websites you have listed are likely to fall into one of three categories: 


*	Websites of the '''strategic agencies'''

*	Websites of '''professional associations''' and '''special interest groups'''

*	Websites of '''local agencies'''


 
==== Websites of the strategic agencies ====


Each of the 4 UK home nations has its own strategic agency for libraries. These are:


*'''Arts Council England'''	http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-libraries/
*'''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''	http://www.scottishlibraries.org/
*'''Museums Archives and Libraries Wales (CyMAL)'''	http://www.cymal.wales.gov.uk/
*'''Library and Information Services Council (Northern Ireland) LISC(NI)'''	http://www.liscni.co.uk/


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.4''' 
 	
Look at each of these 4 websites and compare the information given.

----

==== Websites of professional associations and special interest groups ====


All '''professional associations''' have websites. These usually comprise pages which can be accessed by anyone plus further sections which are '''available only to members''' who use a password to access them. The main professional association in the library field is the '''Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP)''' at: http://www.cilip.org.uk/


Many relevant special interest groups have websites.  These can be particularly useful as they often act as portal sites, collecting links to other websites based on the same or similar topics. Examples are:


*'''CILIP Multimedia Information and Technology Group'''	http://mmitblog.wordpress.com/ 
*'''The Historic Libraries Forum'''	http://www.historiclibrariesforum.org.uk/
*'''International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres''' http://www.iaml-uk-irl.org/

==== Websites of local agencies ====


You should also be aware of the importance of the contents and functions of your own '''local authority website''' and '''local intranet'''. 


Simple client enquiries made at the library counter or over the telephone can often be answered from these sources and it is useful to be well informed regarding content and layout so that site navigation takes the minimum amount of time.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.5''' 

Spend some time making yourself familiar with the website run by your own local authority.

----
 


=== Online professional journals ===


'''Online journals''' offer a readily accessible and searchable source of professional information. Some are freely available but others operate on a subscription basis. Examples are:


*'''CILIP Update'''	http://www.cilip.org.uk/publications/updatemagazine
*'''CILIP in Scotland'''	http://www.cilips.org.uk/
*'''Journal of Information Literacy'''  http://ojs.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL


CILIP members enjoy free online access to the '''Journal of Information Science''' and J'''ournal of Librarianship and Information Science''' from the CILIP website.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.6''' 
  
Look at the latest issue of CILIP Update at http://www.cilip.org.uk/publications/updatemagazine  Familiarise yourself with the layout and content. Is there anything in this issue which is of interest to you in your current job role?

----


You should get into the habit of regularly checking on-line journals to gather information and ideas which are relevant to your own continuing professional development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is designed for the use of students undertaking the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) in '''Applications of ICT in Libraries'''.

-----------------------------CHANGES TO THE QUALIFICATION-----------------------------------
The Diploma and Advanced Diploma have been superceded by the Professional Development Award in Applications of ICT in Libraries at levels 7 and 8 (English and Welsh levels 4 and 5). They consist of much the same content as the Diploma and Advanced Diploma but the PDAs include two new Digital Culture units.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These qualifications were developed by the [http://www.slainte.org.uk '''Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC)'''] and are validated by the [http://www.sqa.org.uk '''Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)'''] 

'''Supporting Clients in the Safe and Legal Use of ICT''' is a Mandatory unit in the level 7 programmes.

Information regarding the '''background to the courses''', '''content''' and '''certification opportunities''' can be obtained by following the '''Diploma''' ([[Diploma ICTL]]) or the '''Advanced Diploma''' ([[Advanced Diploma ICTL]]) links.


== Safe practice relating to the use of ICT for communication ==


=== Using ICT for communication ===


This section relates to supporting clients in '''using ICT safely''' for communication purposes, within the constraints of current legislation. Clients should already possess basic ICT skills, such as simple word processing and the ability to navigate the Internet using a web browser. You should also establish the client’s communication needs, e.g. do they need e-mail for personal or work-related correspondence, in order to assist in the selection of a suitable e-mail service.


The use of e-mail exploded some years ago, encouraged by the fall in prices of home PCs and the introduction of free Internet access in libraries and schools. Since then despite the rise of social media email use has continued to increase and is predicted to continue. Email is an essential method of communication both socially, commercially and professionally.

There are many advantages:


*	the speed of delivery 
*	the ability to send to multiple recipients
*	the flexibility of using web-based e-mail accounts for sending e-mails for various locations 
*	the ability to attach other types of files, such as images. 
*       the low cost involved in sending mail in bulk.


 
==== Electronic mail ====


You should have an in-depth knowledge of electronic mail including:


*	local e-mail software, systems and protocols 
*	the structure of e-mail addresses
*	tracking e-mail messages - delivered, read etc.
*	using importance flags
*	changing setting for preferred presentation


Yo may be asked to set up e-mail accounts for clients …

==== Setting up e-mail accounts ====


A web-based e-mail account is one where the user accesses his or her e-mail by means of a '''web-browser''', such as '''Internet Explorer''' or '''Firefox''', rather than by using a specialist e-mail client program, such as '''Outlook, Outlook Express''' or '''Thunderbird'''.


You should be able to '''set up web based e-mail accounts''' and to show clients how to do this. This includes opening and closing the account. 

 

==== Free e-mail services ====


Popular free e-mail services include the following:


*'''Gmail'''	http://www.gmail.com
*'''Hotmail'''	http://www.hotmail.co.uk
*'''Lycos'''		http://mail.lycos.com/lycos/Index.lycos
*'''Yahoo'''	http://mail.yahoo.com/
*'''Mail2web'''	http://mail2web.com/


For some tips on email providers and the pros and cons associated with each one have a look at this link

http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/features/internet/3448241/whats-best-free-email-service/


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1''' 	

If you are not already familiar with the process, log on to one of the e-mail services above and follow the instructions to create an account for yourself, e.g.: joe_bloggs@hotmail.co.uk. As you do this, note down any points which you would wish to make to clients when demonstrating how to set up an email account. 

You will use this account or one of your own existing ones in subsequent activities. 

----

==== Sending and receiving e-mails ====


Using e-mail is a big step for the uninitiated and assumptions should not be made about how quickly clients can absorb technical details and instructions.


If you are in any doubt, you can find out how to send and receive mail from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll usually find a link to this on the opening page of any web based e-mail service.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2''' 	

Select one of the web-based e-mail services listed above and show a client how to carry out the following tasks: 

1. create a new e-mail

2. add content to an e-mail

3. send an e-mail to a recipient

4. check for new e-mails sent to them

5. open received  e-mails 

6. reply to e-mails received

7. forward a received e-mail to another recipient. 


If you send e-mails to one of the accounts you created earlier, you’ll be able to check that they’ve been received correctly and demonstrate this to the client.

----


Once your clients have mastered the basics of e-mail, they’ll probably want to move on to more complex tasks. Let’s start by looking at sending, receiving and saving attached files …

==== Using attached files ====


One of the particularly useful things about e-mail is the ability to '''attach files''' and thus send, say, copies of photographs to the recipient.  This is particularly useful for older clients staying in touch with their family when they stay at a distance.  Any sort of file can be attached and sent with an e-mail.  Another common file type attached to e-mails is a word processed document

You should be able to show clients '''how to attach files'''. The client may create the file in the library, e.g.: by typing a Word document or scanning in a photograph.  Clients may also wish to attach previously created files brought to the library on floppy disks, CDs or USB flash drives.  Not all library authorities allow the use of removable data, so you should check this for your own library service.

One area where clients may run into difficulties involves the size of attached files
 


==== Size of attached files ====


You should make the clients aware of '''possible limits to the size''' of files attached to e-mails.  There are two points.  Firstly some web-based free e-mail services do not allow particularly large attachments.  The second point is that, if the recipient is on a dial-up connection, large attachments may be almost impossible to download.  This is a particular problem with photographs which can often be several megabytes in size.  


You should explain the idea of possibly '''resizing''' photographs and definitely compressing them.  A rough guide might be that unless there is a special reason, attached photographs should be no more than say 100K in size.


To resize a photograph, the client needs access to image processing software.  A free example may be found in [http://www.irfanview.com Irfan View]On the other hand many e-mail programs offer automatic compression of photographs.



----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.3''' 	

Using one of the e-mail programs listed above, demonstrate to a client how to send both a word-processed document and a photograph as attached files. If you send e-mails to one of the accounts you created earlier, you’ll be able to check that they’ve been received correctly and demonstrate this to the client.

----

==== Using zipped files ====


With e-mail attachments such as large graphics or word processed documents a reduction in size is achieved by '''compressing''' or “zipping” the file.  


If you are using certain operating systems, for example most versions of Linux and Windows ME/2000, file zipping is built in to the operating system. If you are using an earlier version of your operating system, you may need to install a third-party program such as WinZip. You can download an evaluation copy from http://www.winzip.com 


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.4''' 	

Using one of the e-mail programs listed above, demonstrate to a client how to compress or “zip” documents and attach them to an e-mail. If you send e-mails to one of the accounts you created earlier, you’ll be able to check that they’ve been received correctly and demonstrate this to the client. You should also show the client how to decompress or “unzip” files and save or print them.

----


Another area your clients will need to know about is virus checking

==== Virus checking ====


'''Viruses in e-mail attachments''' may cause serious problems for users. Local authorities have anti-virus software in place but you should be aware that this can be a serious problem for home users. Clients can inadvertently pick up viruses and then transfer them between machines when they use files on public access PCs. Automatic checking should be in place but you should still advise clients not to open unrecognised e-mail messages or attachments.


Anti virus facilities, and the degree to which they can be automated, vary between e-mail service providers. You can find out how to configure anti-virus facilities from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services, which you can access from the opening pages.

It might be worth noting that several providers limit sending or receiving of certain attachments (such as .exe, .bat or .com which are all Windows executables) - this can be useful in preventing the spread of viruses but it might hinder you should you wish to send such files legitimately over the system.

==== Implementing virus checking ====


Now try some activities relating to implementing anti-virus software.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.5''' 	

Go to the Lycos web-mail site at http://mail.lycos.com/lycos/Index.lycos and find out which type of virus protection is implemented.


Alternatively, try searching for any email providers anti virus protection. e.g. type gmail virus protection into Google.

----


In order to show clients how to check that the virus checking is turned on in their web-based e-mail service, you must be familiar with this facility in the commonly used services.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.6''' 	

Log on to any of the new e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and make sure that automatic virus checking is turned on, as far as permitted by the e-mail service provider.

----

==== Anti-virus software ====


It is also worth informing clients about general antivirus software, which will protect against viruses from any source not just e-mails e.g. files brought in by a client on a floppy disk. AVG is a free anti-virus program which can be downloaded from http://www.grisoft.com


Evaluation versions of subscription anti-virus programs can often be found on computer magazine cover CDs or they can be downloaded from:


*'''McAfee'''	http://download.mcafee.com/us/eval/evaluate2.asp
*'''Norton'''	http://www.symantecstore.com
*'''Panda'''	http://www.pandasoftware.com/download/


Once clients start to build up a collection of sent and received e-mails, they may need to learn how to manage them so that they can be located easily when required, so let’s have a look at Managing e-mails …

 

==== Managing e-mails ====


The key to '''effective management of e-mails''' is always to have an almost empty in-box.  In other words, when you receive e-mails you should be able to deal with them promptly and either delete them afterwards or store them in other folders which you have prepared in your e-mail program.

You have to show your clients how to do this with their web-based e-mail account. We suggest that you spend a little time with the client, getting an idea of the likely categories for their e-mails, setting up one folder for them and then allowing the client to do this for themselves for the other categories.

Google mail (Gmail) utilises Labels rather than folders. Labels work in a similar way but can take some getting used to especially as emails can be given more than one label.
 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of a typical client and  jot down a list of folder names which might accommodate the majority of their e-mails.

----

==== E-mail folders ====


We can think of the following:


*	Family members
*	Friends
*	On-line shopping
*	Holidays


You may also have thought of others.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.7''' 

Using one of your web-based e-mail accounts, set up folders for the four categories we have listed above.  Note down any specific points you would want to alert a client to when demonstrating this procedure to them.

----


As well as trying to prevent viruses, clients will also need to take steps to protect themselves against other online threats and nuisances. Let’s take a look at Combating spam …

 

==== Combating Spam ====


All e-mail accounts are bombarded to a greater or lesser extent by '''unsolicited e-mails''' sent out by hoaxers or commercial interests. These e-mails are known as “spam”.  In some cases clients will find the spam e-mail subject as well as the content offensive. Most software systems and web based providers offer processes which can block a large percentage of unsolicited mail. 
You should make clients aware that accessing some websites and responding to messages where they are required to type in their e-mail address may aggravate the problem by signing them up to more junk mail.  This is a particular problem with unsolicited e-mails which have a link purporting to remove you from the mailing list but in fact confirms that the account is active and will result in more spam.


The '''spam filtering systems''' used by web based e-mail providers suffer from the same flaw that all spam filtering exhibits – sometimes, genuine wanted e-mail gets classified as spam and does not appear in the in-box.  You can find out how to manage combat spam from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll usually find a link to this on the opening page of the service.


A good suggestion is to have two email accounts, one for personal emailing and another for use when purchasing online. Online shopping is a common way for spammers to find email addresses to pester!
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.8''' 

Log on to each of the new e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and make sure that the spam filters are turned on.    

----

==== E-mail etiquette ====


The term “netiquette” is used to describe the rules that govern polite use of the Internet when interacting with other users.  Clearly, a large part of this centres round the use of e-mails.  


----


[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down any points you can think of relating to courteous and effective use of e-mail.

----


 
==== Netiquette ====


Simple points of e-mail netiquette are:


*	properly describing the purpose of the e-mail in the subject field
*	using spell checking
*	avoid using solely capital letters.  Using capital letters in an e-mail is seen as the equivalent of shouting at someone.  


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.9'''

Look at the exhaustive set of e-mail etiquette rules at http://www.emailreplies.com and make a list of the most obvious ones which you can then demonstrate to clients using e-mail in the library.

----


Clients may also want so send e-mail to news groups, so we’ll look briefly at Using news groups

==== Using news groups ====


When using news groups there is a protocol in replying to the various discussions/threads:


*	make sure that you are using the '''correct news group'''
*	make sure that you really mean to reply to the '''whole group''' and not just send a personal message to an individual member
*	always reply to the '''correct thread'''
*	sending the same message to several groups '''(cross posting)''' is frowned upon.


Clients should be warned that they should always think '''very''' carefully before posting a message to a public newsgroup. There are group archives (e.g.: http://groups.google.com) which store every message ever posted, so a message can have a potential lifespan of many years and could be seen by millions of people! Once a message is posted there is no way of retracting it.


Sometimes clients will want to send an e-mail to several people at the same time, so we’ll look next at Sending e-mail to multiple recipients… 
 


==== E-mailing multiple recipients ====


One of the time-saving features of using e-mail is to be able to send the same information to several people with little more effort that sending to only one recipient.  This, of course, is the reason for the existence of spam.

You should be able to show clients how send e-mail to multiple recipients, including replying to all, adding additional recipients and forwarding files. They should know how to send e-mails to multiple recipients without displaying the e-mail addresses of all recipients, a facility often known as '''blind carbon copies''' (Bcc:).   This last point is important netiquette as it is very impolite to broadcast the e-mail addresses of others without their permission.


You can find out how to send e-mail to multiple recipients from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll find a link to this on the opening page of the service.


A more efficient way of emailing multiple recipients is to create groups. The benefit of using groups is that once created you just type the group name and the email will go to everyone in the group AND you will never miss anyone (as long as you created the group correctly in the first plaace!)

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.10'''

Log on to one of the new e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and send an e-mail message to multiple recipients, i.e.: send the message to Account No 2, copy it to Account 3 and blind copy it to Account 4. Log on to the three recipient accounts and check that the messages have been received correctly.


----


Sometimes clients will reach the stage where an e-mail account is no longer required, so we’ll take a look now at Closing an e-mail account

==== Closing an e-mail account ====


You should warn clients that most web-based free e-mail accounts '''expire''' if not accessed by the user for a specified period of time, sometimes as short as 30 days.  In this way the e-mail account will close itself.  However, it is netiquette that e-mail accounts should be closed when they are no longer required. This avoids the problem of people sending e-mails to what appears to be a valid address, when no-one is checking the account.


You can find out how to close an e-mail account from the help pages of the relevant e-mail services. You’ll find a link to this on the opening page of the service.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.11'''

Log on to each of the four e-mail accounts you created in the first exercise and close each of them. (Assuming you no longer want to use them).

----


Clients will often want to use Internet facilities other than e-mail, so we’ll look next at Using chat rooms

 

==== Using chat rooms ====


Chat rooms are '''virtual social spaces''' on the Internet, where users can communicate with each other. Chat rooms are extremely popular because of their unedited and instantaneous nature. Some chat rooms are used simply for entertainment purposes, perhaps based around a topic such as discussing a daily television soap opera.  Others may be used for more serious discussions.  

As with most of the Internet, younger clients are often very savvy with the technology and are keen on using chat rooms to communicate with others of the same age and with similar interests.  It is easy to see the attraction for young people of being able to access this ‘secret’ world of anonymous communication where their parents cannot see what they are doing and in principle no holds are barred regarding ‘bad’ language. 

You should be able to inform clients about Acceptable practice in chat rooms

Chat rooms have largely been superceded by other social networking services (Facebook, Twitter and Google hangouts etc) but they are still a feature of many peoples online lives.

==== Acceptable practice in chat rooms ====


There has been increasing concern about the use of chat rooms for “grooming”. “Grooming” is the term given to interaction between an adult and a child with an end view of sexualising that relationship. “Grooming” is illegal. You need to advise '''younger clients''' as to how they can keep themselves safe by keeping personal information to themselves and never agreeing to meet alone in person anyone they have a chat room-friendship with. They should report any unwanted attention to their parents and / or the chatroom owners.


You must make adult users of chat rooms aware of what is acceptable when they are using computers in the library – this may be more restrictive than when using home PCs.

You can find Chat services at:

*'''Lycos Chat'''	http://chat.lycos.co.uk/

*'''Social networking websites'''
Social networking websites and Chat rooms share similar concerns about safety and vulnerable groups. Social networking websites are very popular because they bring together friends and friends of friends who share a common interest. The illusion that it is a community of friends sometimes means that natural  caution is abandoned and private details are shared. In many local authorities and organizations access to social networking websites are blocked by firewalls. These website can offer valuable professional tools and there are some examples of these in Unit 4.

Examples of social networking websites include 
*'''Bebo'''	www.bebo.com
*'''Facebook''' 	www.facebook.com
*'''Flickr''' 	www.flickr.com
*'''LinkedIn'''	www.linkedin.com
*'''MySpace'''	www.myspace.com
*'''Tumblr''' 	www.tumblr.com
*'''Twitter'''	http://twitter.com
*'''WindowsLive'''	www.home.live.com

The ICTL units Digital Culture: Online Communication and Digital Culture: Online Collaboration cover social networking in far greater depth.

Clients may experience difficulties in carrying out certain tasks due to security restrictions placed on servers, so let’s take a look at Secure servers
 
----

==== Secure servers ====


Local authorities normally have '''secure servers''' to protect the local authority and public from potentially hostile breaches. This means that desktops are often “locked-down” and you cannot make changes to the settings on PCs in your library. This can be frustrating – especially when simple changes to the resolution of display, for example, would be useful for visually impaired clients. 


Secure servers also have restrictions on adding new software or on downloading executable files.

It may also be worth pointing out to library clients the importance of checking the security of the sites they use when making purchases online. Vendors should always use secure servers for the parts of their systems where customers will be typing in personal and financial details, such as credit card numbers. There are two ways a client can check whether their details are secure:


⋅They should look for a closed padlock symbol, normally in the address window of the web site.

⋅They should check that the web address starts HTTPS. The S is the bit which tells them the server is secure.
 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.14'''

Check your authority’s policy on secure servers and prepare a brief explanatory note for clients.

----


Clients may wish to convert paper-based materials, such as photographs, to digital images so they can be sent as e-mail attachments, so let’s have a look at Scanning images and saving to disk…

==== Scanning and saving images ====


Scanning of images and saving these to disk has increased with the proliferation of '''inexpensive''' scanning devices. Many clients will wish to send copies of photographs to their family via e-mail. 

You should be able to demonstrate to a client how to scan an image – either of text or pictures - and save it to disk.

(Note that the scanned files will often be large and may need to be reduced in size if they are to be attachments to e-mails.)

Since there is such a range of types of scanner and associated software, we cannot realistically give instructions for use here.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.15'''

Practice using your locally-available scanner and software to scan and save both text and images.  Find out how to reduce the resulting file by compressing it so that it will be acceptable as an e-mail attachment. Note down any points which you will want to make your clients aware of.

== Using ICT to support clients with special needs or specific language requirements ==


=== Introduction ===


This section relates to the ways in which ICT can support clients with special needs or those with specific language requirements. For example, this client group might include those '''visually impaired''', those whose '''first language is not English''', those '''disabled''', those with '''literacy difficulties''', and those with '''dyslexia''' or '''learning disabilities'''. 


Many of the clients in this group will be '''mature and capable''' with the same information needs as everyone else and could benefit from some of the assistive technologies to enable them to access the wide range of resources. 


'''Sensitivity''' is required in assessing the ability and aptitude of the client. It is important to remember that disabilities may not affect the reading level of clients or their interests. It may be useful to use pictograms instead of text in signage for some clients in this group.

 

==== Websites for those with special needs or specific language requirements ====


When dealing with clients having special needs or specific language requirements, special care should be given to the '''appropriateness''' of recommended websites. As well as the criteria applied to assessing the appropriateness of websites in general, you should exercise care to ensure that clients are directed towards accessible sites with appropriate content and format. For example, visually impaired people may be unable to access websites which are incompatible with software which they rely on. 


'''Clients with Impaired Vision'''


Clients with impaired vision may be able to use a normal monitor screen if the settings are adjusted to give '''large font size''' and '''high contrast'''. However, others will need to use a software package which will read out the text on the web page – a screen reader.


Some web sites will not work well with a screen reader.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you think of features on a website page which would cause difficulties for a client with impaired vision using a screen reader?

----



==== Problems for clients with impaired vision ====


The main problems are caused by screens which have no text. If it is not possible to read meaningfully only the text on the website page, then the screen reader will not be successful.

So the following are the problem areas:


*	Web pages which '''overly rely''' on graphics
*	Web pages which have graphics or photographs with '''no alternative text''' explanation
*	Web pages with text which is '''presented within a graphic'''
*	Web pages which use '''explanatory animations'''


The worst offenders can be sites that start in Flash with '''no text option''', so that the user gets no information from the screen reader and doesn’t know if the site is open or not.




==== Screen readers ====


Some problems have been reported in using screen readers with early version of Adobe Acrobat, but these have been overcome in later versions. You can find more information about this at:

http://www.adobe.com (type screen readers in the search window)


A good example of a screen reader which is well liked by users is JAWS for Windows. You can find more information about it at: http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/JAWS_HQ.asp 


Many libraries use '''Supernova''', which incorporates a screen reader called '''HAL'''. Supernova also incorporates a very good monitor screen magnification element - so it can help partially sighted clients. You can get further information (and download an evaluation copy) from: http://www.synapseadaptive.com/dolphin/  


The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) site gives a useful list of access software at:
http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/softwareandtechnology/softwareaccesscentre/Pages/software_access_centre.aspx

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1''' 

To get a better feel for screen reader software and especially to assist those clients with visual impairment, visit the RNIB site mentioned above and follow the links to some of the sites listed. Download evaluation copies of a few of the software packages and try them out. 

----

==== Colour blindness ====


Colour blindness is another factor which can affect a client’s ability to use a website. There are software packages which:


a)	permit a person who is not colour blind to view a web page '''as it would appear to a colour blind person'''. This can be a useful check for library staff before recommending a website.

b)	Use '''image processing techniques''' to make web pages clearer for those with colour blindness.

 	

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2''' 

Go to http://colorfilter.wickline.org/ and try the procedure on some webpages which you commonly use. How readable would they be to a client with colour blindness?

An alternative colour blindness simulator just for images is http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/

The SLIC website (http://www.slainte.org.uk/accessandequity/webdesign.htm) provides information on webpage design support and PC accessibility issues.

----

==== Clients with specific language requirements ====


When assisting clients with specific language requirements, it is worth turning to the Google search engine.  This provides a useful set of '''language tools''' for finding information and/or websites in specific languages and for translating between a range of languages.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3''' 

Use the Google language tools to: 

a) translate a favourite web page into another language; 

b) translate a foreign-language web page into English.

Another site which offers translation facilities for text and web pages is: http://www.babelfish.com/ 

c) Try the two tasks above using Babelfish as well. Which site do you think gives the best translations?

d) It's important to note that the translation might be a little rough around the edges. Try translating a simple phrase to another language, and then back into English. You might notice quite a change in the meaning of the phrase!

----

=== Evaluating websites against best practice guidance ===


Websites which can help assess the suitability of website material include:


*'''World Wide Web 3 Consortium'''	http://www.w3.org/WAI/
*'''WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool'''	http://wave.webaim.org/
*'''SLIC'''	http://www.slainte.org.uk/accessandequity/equityindex.htm


Look at the World Wide Web 3 Consortium pages and find out exactly what Best Practice in terms of web accessibility means.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4''' 

Follow the link to WAVE given above and use the tool to check the accessibility of a few of your favourite websites.
 
----

=== Assistive technologies ===


Technology can help to balance the difficulties encountered by some client groups. For example, those with motor impairment can access PCs with the aid of a large t'''rack ball mouse, touch screens, adapted keyboards''' and '''special software'''. 


You can find a number of companies which specialise in supplying assistive technology equipment.  An example is Inclusive Technology at:  http://www.inclusive.co.uk/. 
They have an online catalogue which groups the various items in broad headings.  

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.5''' 

Browse the Inclusive Technology catalogue. This will give you a good overview of what is available in hardware assistance. 

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.6''' 

Find out what is available within your own library and library service which would support clients requiring assistive technology. Make a note on each item for future use.

----

 

==== Assistive technologies for clients whose first language is not English ====


You should also be able to use software or keyboard adaptations for people whose first language is not English. It is important for you to know about both what is available locally and organisations to whom clients can be referred. 


'''Adaptive furniture''' can be of great use to help clients. You can see an on-line catalogue on the website of Synapse Adaptive here: http://www.synapseadaptive.com/ 

They cover many adaptive technologies but if you look for hardware and then ergonomics, you will find a number of desk and chair items.

 

=== Changing software and keyboard settings ===


Although assistive technologies are widely available, sometimes all that is required to improve access for a client is to change the keyboard or software settings. This can allow the enlargement of text, icons and the speed of a mouse click to the client’s comfort.


'''Windows''' offers a huge range of '''accessibility features''', including adjusting Display Options, adjusting Mouse Options, adjusting Keyboard Options, adjusting Internet Options, adjusting Sounds and Audio Options, adjusting Taskbar and Menu Options, adjusting User Accounts Options, adjusting Speech Options, Utility Manager, On-Screen Keyboard, Narrator and Magnifier.


The Microsoft website has details of these at: http://www.microsoft.com/enable/


Windows has an accessibility wizard which can take the client through the various PC settings.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.7'''
 
If you are using Windows 8 visit http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windows8/ for help. Try the features.

If you have access to Windows XP you can use the '''Accessibility Wizard''' to explore the Accessibility features. You can start it by clicking on: '''Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Wizard''' OR '''Start &gt; Run''' type accwiz in the Open window.

If you are using an earlier version of Windows, or another Operating System, check your local help files to find out what options are available.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.8'''

From the information sources above, or additionally from the '''AbilityNet MyWay''' site at: http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/search/node/myway  make a note of the accessibility features you are likely to require to show to clients.  Jot down the steps you have to carry out to implement them.

----

=== Voice synthesis and voice recognition ===


Voice synthesis software can be used as an alternative to keying in and outputting in text format. 
There are two types of software required for this.  


'''Voice recognition software''' allows a client via microphone to give spoken commands to the computer, to allow PC use without a keyboard.  


'''Voice output''' from the PC is achieved by software which reads out what is displayed on the screen.  This is of great use to clients with vision problems.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.9''' 

Find out which of these types of systems are available in your own library service.

----

 

==== Voice synthesis and voice recognition products ====


There are a number of products available for both voice synthesis and voice recognition, including '''Dragon Naturally Speaking''', '''CoolSpeach''' and '''Microsoft Speech Server'''. You can find further information about one of the best known products at the following web site:



*'''Dragon Naturally Speaking:''' 	http://www.scansoft.com/naturallyspeaking/ 

There are of course many others

Some operating system versions have voice synthesis built in.  Again the AbilityNet MyWay site at: http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/search/node/myway  has information on this topic


Of course many people now use mobile devices to access information and people using iPods or devices running on the Android operating system have a built in Voice Commands (iPod voice Control, Android Voice Actions) functionality.
			
 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.10'''
 
Select a voice recognition package and a voice synthesis package available to your library service.  In each case set up the package and get practice at using it.  Jot down sufficient notes so that you can demonstrate it to a client in the future.

----

== Legislation relating to the use of ICT for storage, manipulation and access of information ==


=== Introduction ===


This section relates to legislation concerning the use of ICT for '''storage, manipulation''' and '''access''' of information. Government legislation has a significant impact on ICT in libraries and staff require a sound working knowledge to ensure that clients can use ICT safely and legally.

=== Data Protection Act ===


The '''Data Protection Act 1998''' applies across the UK and gives legal rights to individuals in respect of their '''personal data''' held by others. Libraries must ensure that the ways they process personal data of clients and staff, whether manually recorded or computerised, comply with the provisions of the Act. This is particularly relevant to client data stored in an automatic library management system. Such ICT based systems facilitate analysis of client data which would not be possible with manual systems.


The following information is extracted from the '''Data Protection Act Fact Sheet''', which can be downloaded from the Information Commissioner’s website at: http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/.


The Data Protection Act 1998 seeks to strike a balance between the rights of individuals and the sometimes competing interests of those with legitimate reasons for using personal information. 
We will look at the following useful sections:


*	The eight principles of good practice
*	The six conditions for fair data processing
*	Sensitive data 
*	Rights under the Act
*	Criminal offences created by the Act	
*	Unsolicited electronic communications
*	The role of the Information Commissioner’s Office 

 

==== The eight principles of good practice ====


Anyone processing personal information must comply with eight '''enforceable principles''' of good information handling practice. These say that data must be:


**1. 	fairly and lawfully processed
**2. 	processed for limited purposes
**3. 	adequate, relevant and not excessive
**4. 	accurate and up to date
**5. 	not kept longer than necessary
**6. 	processed in accordance with the individual’s rights
**7. 	secure
**8. 	not transferred to countries outside European Economic area unless country has adequate protection for the individual

==== The six conditions for fair data processing ====


At least one of the following conditions must be met for personal information to be considered fairly processed:


**1.	the individual has consented to the processing
**2.	processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the individual
**3.	processing is required under a legal obligation (other than one imposed by the contract)
**4.	processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the individual
**5.	processing is necessary to carry out public functions, e.g. administration of justice
**6.	processing is necessary in order to pursue the legitimate interests of the data controller or third parties (unless it could unjustifiably prejudice the interests of the individual)

 

==== Sensitive data ====


Specific provision is made under the Act for processing '''sensitive personal information'''. This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health condition, sex life, criminal proceedings or convictions.


For personal information to be considered fairly processed, at least one of several extra conditions must be met.  These include:


*	Having the explicit consent of the individual
*	Being required by law to process the information for employment purposes
*	Needing to process the information in order to protect the vital interests of the individual or another person
*	Dealing with the administration of justice or legal proceedings

 

==== Rights under the Act ====



There are seven rights under the Data Protection Act.


*1.	'''The right to subject access:''' This allows people to find out what information is held about them on computer and within some manual records.

*2.	'''The right to prevent processing:''' Anyone can ask a data controller not to process information relating to him or her that causes substantial unwarranted damage or distress to them or anyone else.

*3.	'''The right to prevent processing for direct marketing:''' Anyone can ask a data controller not to process information relating to him or her for direct marketing purposes.

*4.	'''Rights in relation to automated decision-taking:''' Individuals have a right to object to decisions made only by automatic means e.g. there is no human involvement.

*5.	'''The right to compensation:''' An individual can claim compensation from a data controller for damage and distress caused by any breach of the act. Compensation for distress alone can only be claimed in limited circumstances.

*6.	'''The right to rectification, blocking, erasure and destruction:''' Individuals can apply to the court to order a data controller to rectify, block or destroy personal details if they are inaccurate or contain expressions of opinion based on inaccurate information.

*7.	'''The right to ask the Commissioner to assess whether the Act has been contravened:''' If someone believes their personal information has not been processed in accordance with the DPA, they can ask the Commissioner to make an assessment. If the Act is found to have been breached and the matter cannot be settled informally, then an enforcement notice may be served on the data controller in question.

==== Criminal offences created by the Act ====


A number of '''criminal offences''' are created by the Act and include:


'''Notification offences:''' This is where processing is being undertaken by a data controller who has not notified the Commissioner either of the processing being undertaken or of any changes that have been made to that processing.


'''Procuring and selling offences:''' It is an offence to knowingly or recklessly obtain, disclose or procure the disclosure of personal information without the consent of the data controller.  There are some exceptions to this – for example, where such obtaining or disclosure was necessary for crime prevention/detection.  If a person has obtained personal information illegally it is an offence to offer or to sell personal information.

 

==== Unsolicited electronic communications ====


The '''Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003''' cover, amongst other things, unsolicited electronic marketing communications.


*'''Unsolicited marketing calls''' should not be made to individual subscribers who have opted out either directly or by registering with the central stoplist, the '''Telephone Preference Service''' (TPS), or to corporate subscribers (e.g. companies) who have objected either directly or by registering on the Corporate TPS.


*'''Unsolicited marketing faxes''' should not be sent to individuals without their prior consent or to any subscriber who has objected, either directly or by registering on the Fax Preference Service (FPS).


*'''Unsolicited marketing emails or SMS''' should not be sent to any individual subscriber who has not consented unless the email address or phone number was collected in the context of a commercial relationship.


*'''Wholly automated marketing calls''', i.e. where a recorded message is played and the recipient does not speak to a human being, can only be made where the subscriber concerned (whether individual or corporate) has consented.


==== The role of the Information Commissioner’s Office ====


The ICO has specific responsibilities for the promotion and enforcement of the DPA.
Under the Data Protection Act, the Information Commissioner may:


*	serve information notices requiring data controllers to supply him with the information he needs to assess compliance.

*	where there has been a breach, serve an enforcement notice (which requires data controllers to take specified steps or to stop taking steps in order to comply with the law). Appeals to these notices may be made to the Information Tribunal.


==== Other Useful DPA websites ====


There are several websites which give more details and explanations.  We have listed some below:


*The '''Data Protection Act''' itself can be found at: http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980029.htm 


*The website of the '''Information Commissioner''' is at: http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/ 


*The website of the '''Scottish Information Commissioner''' is at: http://www.itspublicknowledge.info 


Useful information on this topic can also be found on the CILIP website.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1''' 	

Search the CILIP website at: http://www.cilip.org.uk  for ‘data protection act’. Make a note of any aspects of data protection which are particularly relevant to your own work.

----


Another aspect of data protection is that related to '''Government initiatives''' on privacy and data sharing led by the Ministry of Justice, which aim to increase the data which can be shared by public bodies.  You can find information on the website of the Ministry of Justice at: http://www.justice.gov.uk/information-access-rights/

=== Copyright legislation ===


Copyright legislation is UK-wide and a number of Statutory Instruments have been put in place to ensure that '''European Copyright Directives''' are enacted in the UK. The key Act is the '''Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988''' which determines what is illegal and what is permissible. '


The purpose of copyright is to ensure that the creator (person who holds the intellectual property right) or owner of the copyright can:


*	derive any financial benefit relating to their material  

*	have control over the way in which their material is used. 


Regular revisions of copyright legislation take place so information professionals must keep their knowledge up to date. 


Copyright law is very complex but it is important that you have a sound knowledge of what is permissible and the role of library staff in enforcing copyright.


The '''Intellectual Property Office''' website at: http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ has a good summary of copyright issues. The information on the following pages is extracted from there and summarises the principal points.

 
==== Ownership and duration of copyright ====


The author is the first owner of copyright in a '''literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work'''. In the case of films, the principal director and the film producer are joint authors and first owners of copyright. The main exception is where a work or film is made in the '''course of employment''', in which case the employer owns the copyright. The copyright in sound recordings, broadcasts and published editions generally belongs to the record producer, broadcaster or publisher.


Copyright protection in the UK is '''automatic''' and there is '''no registration system''' - so there are no forms to fill in and no fees to pay.


Copyright is a form of '''intellectual property''' and, like physical property, can be '''bought and sold, inherited''' or '''otherwise transferred'''. A transfer of ownership may cover all or only some of the rights to which a copyright owner is entitled. First or subsequent copyright owners can choose to '''license''' others to use their works whilst retaining ownership themselves.


Copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work (including a photograph) lasts until '''70 years after the death of the author'''. The duration of copyright in a film is 70 years after the death of the last to survive of the principal director, the authors of the screenplay and dialogue, and the composer of any music specially created for the film. '''Sound recordings''' are generally protected for '''50 years from the year of publication. Broadcasts''' are protected for '''50 years and published editions''' are protected for '''25 years'''.


The following are useful websites providing information on copyright:


*'''Intellectual Property Office'''		http://www.ipo.gov.uk/
*'''Copyright Licensing Agency'''	http://www.cla.co.uk/
*'''Copyright, Designs and  Patents Act 1988'''	http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm

==== Copyright and the Internet ====


With the proliferation of electronic communications via the Internet, there has been a massive opportunity created for the '''infringement''' of copyright.  


The Internet provides text and illustrations in electronic format, making it easy for the unscrupulous user to '''cut and paste''' web material into their own documents. You will already be familiar with copyright law restrictions on copying material from books and journals. Similar provisions apply to material from the Internet. It is important to make clients aware that they should check the legality of making multiple copies of textual material from Internet sites.


The greatest areas of commercial concern have been copyright infringements involving '''music files''' and '''still and moving images'''.  It is clear to see that a digital file can be very easily and at virtually no cost copied and distributed anywhere in the World via the Internet.  The creator of the original work is excluded from the process and thus receives no financial reward.  Not surprisingly the media companies have been in the vanguard of creating means of prevention.
A number of '''defensive methods''' have been created to counter copyright infringement in the digital domain.

 

==== Digital Rights Management (DRM) ====


This is a large area but the greatest and most visible use is (and will be even more so in the future) the '''prevention of copying of films''' (movies) from DVDs.  This requires mechanisms to be active in one or both of the DVD disk itself and the DVD player or computer used.  Examples are:


*	the need to keep a Satellite Television receiver box connected to the public telephone network
*	certain high definition film disks can only be played back on a computer which is connected to the Internet
*	the very latest large screen television displays will need a special module to display the coming high definition DVD films.  Absence of the module disables the output from the DVD player.  The existence of the module guarantees that the incoming digital signal is not being copied.
*	the regional coding of DVDs which does not allow a DVD disk purchased in the USA to be played on a European region DVD player.


You can find additional information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management
and at: http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-other/c-protect.htm

==== Digital watermarking ====


This is a computer encryption which is inserted into the image. It is of particular use with images which are placed on websites and thus easily copied.  It is invisible to the casual user but provides a '''tracking mechanism''' for owners. It is a digital code, which can be unique to the image or shared across the owner’s other images. You can find additional information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking and http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/digital_watermark.html

'''Digital fingerprints''' are unique labels inserted into different copies of the same content (e.g.: an e-book, video or music file) prior to distribution. Each digital fingerprint is assigned to a specific recipient, and thus provides the capability to trace the culprits who use their content for unintended purposes. Fingerprints should be closely associated with the content and difficult to remove.

'''ACTIVITY 3.2''' 	

Visit http://www.steganos.com  and download the test version of Steganos Security Suite. Install the program and try using it to hide watermarks (or other messages) in GIF pictures. 

----

=== Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) ===


The growth of Internet use and ease with which files and ideas can be transferred across continents has led to tighter regulation of and concern for '''intellectual property rights'''. Intellectual property refers to the rights of the thought process and intellectual creativity which developed the work. Information professionals should be aware of the Intellectual Property Rights issues. You should be aware that intellectual property is the '''legally enforceable''' right of the owner.


Most countries have laws regulating the copying of inventions, identifying symbols and creative expressions. The UK laws cover four main types of intangible property: '''patents, trademarks, copyrights''' and '''trade secrets''', referred to collectively as “intellectual property.” 


Intellectual property has many of the same characteristics as tangible property. It is an asset which can be bought, sold, licensed, exchanged or given away. The intellectual property owner has the right to prevent unauthorised '''use''' or '''sale''' of the property. 


Clients should be aware that they should not use library computers (or any others) to do anything which infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights, e.g.: by copying content from someone else’s website into their own document, or illegally copying music files.


You can find lots of additional information at The Intellectual Property Office http://www.ipo.gov.uk/

== Freedom of Information legislation and information access issues ==


=== Freedom of Information legislation ===


Freedom of Information legislation was introduced across the United Kingdom at the beginning of 2005. The Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation is different for '''Scotland''' from that in the rest of the UK, but the information given here is generally applicable throughout the UK. However you should always check the precise details against the relevant website for your own country. 


You can find a comprehensive description of the act and its implications at the website of the Information Commissioner at: http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/freedom_of_information and for Scotland at the websites of the Scottish Information Commissioner at: www.itspublicknowledge.info 


The FOI legislation provides a right of access to the information of public bodies by individuals. Information can be in print, electronic, video or audio format. 


Working in a library you need to be aware of the procedures so that you can assist a client to make an information request on the basis of FOI legislation.  You should also be aware of the position regarding your own local authority and its requirements to disclose information.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''
 	
A client approaches you with a request involving the FOI legislation.  He wishes to find out how much money is spent by the local authority on traffic calming measures.Go to the website appropriate to your geographical location and make notes on the process of requesting information which will be useful for clients in the future.

----


 

==== Freedom of Information Act ====


The following details on the FOI legislation is based on information from the '''Information Commissioner’s''' website:


The '''Freedom of Information Act''' enables people to gain access to information held by public authorities in two ways:


'''Publication Schemes'''

Every public authority must make some information available as a matter routine through a '''publication scheme'''. Information that is included in such a scheme must be made available to the public. A publication scheme is both a public commitment to make certain information available and a guide to how that information can be obtained. 


'''General right of access'''

Any person has the right to make a request for '''information held by a public authority'''. The authority must usually respond to this request within 20 working days. This right came into force on the 1 January 2005.


'''Exemptions'''

The Act recognises that there are grounds for '''withholding information''' and provides a number of '''exemptions''' from the right to know, some of which are subject to a public interest test. The Act also sets out procedures for dealing with requests, such as '''time limits''' for compliance and '''fees''' that must be charged.


'''Making complaints'''

The Information Commissioner is the '''independent regulator''' of the Act, with responsibilities to promote the legislation and enforce compliance with its provisions. This includes making decisions as to whether a public authority has dealt with requests properly.

=== Acceptable Use Policies ===


For legal reasons each library must have an '''Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)''' covering client access to ICT equipment and the Internet. Each authority will have an individual AUP policy reflecting the local circumstances. Each client using the library facilities is required to indicate acceptance of the policy. It is important that the AUP is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it complies with current legislation. 


The AUP must state that Internet access is monitored using '''manual and electronic resources''' and that '''records of Internet access''' are kept. The AUP should also specify the actions and '''penalties''' which could result from contravention of the AUP. This includes providing the police with information where it is suspected that a criminal act has taken place.



If you select the People's Network Internet Acceptable Use Toolkit  there are several examples of local authority AUPs.

'''ACTIVITY 4.3''' 	

Obtain a copy of the AUP for your own library.  Read it over and make a set of notes to enable you to explain the various points to a client new to the library computer facilities.

----

=== Content filtering ===


Internet filtering systems used in libraries are designed to '''prevent clients accessing unsuitable material'''. When the filtering system is turned on, users cannot open or link to web sites that the filtering system recognises as unsuitable. 


The filtering system is a software package which can be installed on a PC or a server (to regulate multiple machines).  The software can use one or both of two principles. 

 
*1.	When a site is requested, it will check the URL of the site against a list of '''proscribed sites'''.  If the site is on the list, the software will block access.  The list is updated at periodic intervals by the software supplier.

*2.	When a site is requested, the software will check over the site and attempt to recognise '''key words''' which would indicate an unsuitable site and then block access. 


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of a disadvantage for each of the above methods.

----



==== Approaches to content filtering ====


Although a useful tool, Internet filtering systems are not foolproof.


The first method depends on the list of proscribed sites being complete.  It would be impossibly expensive for every website on the Internet to be rated using a human observer.  There will also be a '''delay''' in a new unsuitable site appearing and being added to the list.


The second method suffers from the difficulty of '''placing keywords into context'''.  An example being, it has difficulty in distinguishing between the names of body parts used in a pornographical or medical context. Another example is that access may be blocked to sites containing innocuous words, one component of which may be of a sexual or profane nature e.g. Essex (though more complex filters are now sometimes able to recognise such cases).  Also, this method checks only for unaccepatble text, not unacceptable images or speech.


Any blocking system can be potentially over-ridden by users with technical knowledge, or by using one of the many proxy sites which allow you to circumnavigate blocks by browsing through a proxy server.



reporting websites is another way of controlling what is available, see http://www.iwf.org.uk/

==== The Family Online Safety Institute (formerly The Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA)) ====


FOSI provide a set of categories and levels within each category:


*	The presence or absence of nudity 
*	The presence or absence of sexual content 
*	The depiction of violence 
*	The language used 
*	The presence or absence of user-generated content and whether this is moderated 
*	The depiction of other potentially harmful content such as gambling, drugs and alcohol


The user’s browser has to be configured to use the system. Clearly there are obvious weaknesses here in that website developers are not required to use the ratings, and they may be misused.  However, similar to the '''age ratings' associated with films and computer games, this may in the long run be the best possibility for filtering.


Since there are weaknesses in each approach, filtering can not replace vigilance or simple common sense from library staff.

'''ACTIVITY 4.4'''
 
Find out the filtering policies in place in your local authority and what your own responsibility is. 

----

==== Walled Gardens ====


The walled garden approach is often used for young clients. Here, instead of trying to block access to possible unsuitable sites and allowing access to all other sites, the “walled garden” only offers access to '''pre-selected websites'''. This is a much simpler approach.  Instead of trying to cope with rating or searching through the 25,270,000,000 websites catalogued by Google today, a small number of hand picked sites are allowed to be browsed.  Of course the quality of this service relies upon the nature of the vetting before access is allowed.


The disadvantage is of course the '''exclusion of many potentially useful''' sites.  There have also been issues with e-mail and search engines allowing a hole to be made in the wall.


Social networking websites, such as http://www.facebook.com and http://www.flickr.com, can also be regarded as walled gardens. This is because the owner can control the range of people who view their messages and updates. Another aspect of walled gardens is the barriers which prevent the free flow of information and this is also true of social networking sites with their custom language and proprietary nature. This means that information can’t be transferred or access from one platform to another.

==== Suppliers of filtering software ====


The following sites are suppliers of '''filtering software''', mainly aimed at young clients, which also provide lots of useful information on internet safety:


*'''SafeSurf'''	http://www.safesurf.com
*'''CyberPatrol'''	http://www.cyberpatrol.com
*'''NetNanny'''	http://www.netnanny.com


Trial versions of several of these can be downloaded from the relevant website.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.5''' 
 	
Download an evaluation copy of CyberPatrol and try it out.

----

=== Internet safety with younger clients ===


Clearly the previous section covering content filtering is particularly applicable to young clients.  It may be appropriate to '''reserve particular machines''' for particular user groups with regard to the type of material which may be accessed.  This can also be managed by user ID login procedures.  

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.7''' 

Find out what is the situation in your own library with regard to the reserving of particular PC’s for restricted access to Internet materials.

Undoubtedly, the younger clients will have the most restricted access. There are serious risks to younger clients with the possibility of someone being hurt, exploited or abused as a result of personal information being posted online or falling victim to “grooming” (covered in Outcome One of this unit).

There are many useful websites which promote safe use of the Internet to younger clients, their parents and teachers.  Here are three we would recommend you look at:

*'''ClickThinking'''	at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/09154928/1  
*'''Kidsmart''' at http://www.kidsmart.org.uk/ 
*'''UK Government  Internet Safety Advice''' at https://www.gov.uk/search?q=internet+safety
*'''DirectGov  Internet Safety''' at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Yourchildshealthandsafety/Internetsafety/index.htm
----



==== Illegal material ====


Much material exists on the Internet which it is a criminal offence to access. The catchphrase is ‘If it is illegal off-line - it is illegal on-line’. Three types of Internet content are generally regarded as illegal in the UK:


*	images of child abuse hosted anywhere in the world 
*	criminally obscene images hosted in the UK  
*	criminally racist content hosted in the UK


Even though '''filtering''' and '''acceptable use policies''' are in place in local authorities, breaches can very easily happen. It is important that you are aware of the local procedures for dealing with such situations.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.8''' 

Here are two scenarios involving a client accessing illegal materials. Consult your library service’s Acceptable Use Policy and/or staff manual and make notes of what action you would take in each case.

1. An adult client is observed systematically accessing criminally racist content on a public access PC.

2. An adult client accidentally accesses images of child abuse whilst carrying out a genuine information search on another topic.

----

== Define the detail of a complex enquiry in conjunction with the client ==



=== Reference interview techniques for complex enquiries ===



In this outcome we will explore how you should tease out the details of a complex enquiry posed by a library client.  We define a complex enquiry as one where:


*	the sources to be searched for information are '''not obvious''' at the outset of the inquiry
*	the precise nature of the topic requires to be '''teased''' out in some detail with the client
*	a minimum of 3 '''variables''' are linked in a Boolean search.


From this we can see that the typical client for such complex enquiries is likely (but not always) to be a person with some '''knowledge or expertise''' in the subject area.  Where this is so, you should capitalise on this at the initial stage and gain as much specific information as possible from the client.


 
==== Defining the nature of the enquiry ====


Defining the precise nature of the enquiry in conjunction with the client is often referred to as the '''reference interview'''.  However, you may not be able to carry this out face to face.  Instead you may carry out the interview over the telephone.  Whether communicating face-to-face or by phone, do remember that the reference interview is a '''two-way interaction''' or dialogue and you must take responsibility for the efficiency of the communication process.


You may use e-mails as part of the process, but we would recommend that, with complex enquiries, the bulk of the reference interview is oral.  With a detailed and complex enquiry, you would find it difficult to gather from the client the level of detail which you require from the client through e-mails alone.


By the end of the reference interview you should be confident that the nature of the complex enquiry has been '''fully explored''' and that the information required by the client has been specifically defined.


The reference interview also provides the opportunity to '''establish any special needs''' of the client e.g.: visual or auditory impairment.  This requires a '''tactful''' and '''sympathetic''' approach. You may need to ask for '''assistance''' from a colleague with specialist knowledge on disability issues.


And finally, do remember to record '''contact details''' for the client.  In the excitement of exploring the enquiry and establishing the client’s precise needs, it is all too easy to forget this important information.  So check at the end of every reference interview that you have a record of the client’s name, address, telephone, fax and e-mail details, as appropriate.  If you will be phoning the client, it is also polite to note '''when''' it is convenient for the client to receive your call.

 

==== Communication skills ====


Good communication skills are key to the reference interview.  This unit outcome provides a good opportunity for '''practising''' and '''refining''' your communication skills. These include: 


*	Appropriate spoken language
*	Appropriate body language
*	Good feedback, especially on the telephone
*	Note taking 
*	Clear and grammatical e-mails 


We will briefly examine each of these.


==== Spoken language ====


You should use language which is '''appropriate to the client''', avoiding talking down to the client or, at the other extreme, baffling the client with '''specialist jargon'''.  If you do have to use a term which the client may not understand, e.g. “search engine syntax”, be sure to explain it.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Explain Dark Internet


Conversely a client with expertise in the field they are enquiring about is likely to use '''specialist or technical vocabulary''' when describing the search topic.  Such vocabulary can be useful for you when you are deciding on your search terms (see Outcomes 2 and 3) but make sure that you fully understand the meaning of any such specialist terms.  The client should be able to explain them to you.


 
==== Body language ====


In face-to-face situations, use appropriate body language designed to set the client at ease and promote effective communication.  Smile and greet the client by name if possible.  Lean forward slightly and use eye contact to show your interest in the conversation.  Try to carry out the interview in a place where both you and the client are sitting comfortably and at the same level, preferably side by side.

 

==== Feedback  ====


You should use appropriate '''feedback techniques''' to ensure understanding of the client’s responses. For instance, you might:


*	'''Rephrase''' what the client has said and repeat this back to them
*	Read out a '''summary''' of the enquiry based on the notes you have made.


With telephone communications you will have to be careful in order to make sure that you fully understand what the client says because you will get no clues from their '''body language'''.  See if you can pick up clues from the tone of the client’s voice.  Conversely, make sure that your tone is positive and encouraging.  Smiling as you speak into the phone generates a '''pleasant tone of voice''' which encourages helpful responses.



==== Note taking ====


In both face to face and telephone interactions, it is essential to take '''written notes''' of the main points of the conversation.  These notes are your reference for checking that you have fully understood the details of the client’s enquiry.  Full notes are also useful if you have to put the query on one side for actioning later or pass it on to a colleague to deal with.  The more complex the enquiry, the more comprehensive your notes should be.

 

==== Writing e-mails ====


If you are using e-mails to communicate with the client, it is important to establish a '''cordial tone''' while remaining concise and to the point.  Writing '''clearly and grammatically''' is key to this, as is structuring your e-mail well so that the client can follow it easily and respond appropriately.  Saving e-mails, both those you send and those you receive, provides a record of your communication with the client.

 

==== Open and Closed Questions ====


In the reference interview, you will use both '''open''' and '''closed''' questions.  These have different uses.  It is important to be able to distinguish between the two types of question and to use them appropriately.


Closed questions prompt yes/no or '''short factual answers''', such as:


*Q. What is the deadline for my getting this information for you? 
*A. Next Tuesday


*Q. Have you checked this reference already? 
*A. Yes


Open questions encourage '''longer answers''', such as:


*Q. Can you explain briefly what my colleague did last time? 
*A. She started with Yahoo and then tried a couple of other search engines as well.  I think she was looking it up under something like pagan religions in Wales.  We got quite a lot of useful stuff.

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, explain at what points during the reference interview and for what purposes you are likely to use:

*a) closed questions
*b) open questions.

----

==== Using open and closed questions ====


Closed questions prompting yes/no or short factual answers are mainly used in the reference interview context to:


*	elicit '''specific pieces of information''' from the client  
*	gain '''confirmation''' that your understanding of what the client has said is correct - an important feedback tool.


You are likely to use closed questions 


*	at the '''start of the interview''' when you are taking basic personal details of the client
*	at intervals '''throughout the discussion''' when you want to check you have your facts right
*	at the '''end of the interview''' to sum up and agree on future action.


Open questions encourage longer answers and their main uses in the reference interview context are to:


*	establish '''rapport''' with the client, especially in the initial stages of the interview and with clients who are not already known to you
*	set the scene for the enquiry and gain '''background information''' at the beginning of the discussion
*	encourage '''input''' from the client as the interview progresses. 


So you will use both open and closed questions at appropriate times.  When framing a question, always think of the type of response you hope to generate and word the question so as to encourage either a '''brief''' or an '''extended''' answer.

 

=== Eliciting information and advice from knowledgeable clients ====


The interview is likely to begin with the client asking you a question.  Your task is to probe further until you are fully satisfied that you are clear '''exactly what the client wishes to find out'''.  Remember to ask for clarification from the client about the topic e.g. ask them to spell uncommon words, expand on the topic under investigation etc.  This is particularly important with clients who may be subject experts.


While recognising that some clients may be unwilling to give this information, it is helpful if you can establish in some detail the '''reasons''' why the client wishes the information requested. One important point to establish is whether they require the information for themselves or whether they are enquiring on behalf of someone else.

 


==== Determining the starting point  ====


It is important to ascertain the “starting point” of the enquiry in order to avoid wasting time on finding information which the client already knows.  This is particularly important with '''complex enquiries''' for knowledgeable clients, where it may be relatively easy to access information at a simple level, when the client actually requires more sophisticated results.


In a complex enquiry from a specialist enquirer, it is likely that the enquirer has already undertaken some basic searching on their own behalf.  Equally a well-informed enquirer may well be familiar with some or all of the '''sources of information''' in their field.  You should therefore try to determine what research the client has already undertaken on the topic and what results were obtained.  It is often helpful to ask the client’s opinion on the usefulness or otherwise of particular sources. 


A knowledgeable client may also be able to give you some guidance on successful and unsuccessful information searching approaches.  However, do not make the assumption that, because the client is knowledgeable about the topic to be investigated, they are well informed about information sources and search techniques.  Remember that you are the '''information-searching specialist''' (while the client is the subject specialist) and so you should critically evaluate any advice on sources and information searching techniques provided by the client.

=== Determining the nature of detailed information to be provided ===


Apart from the actual topic of investigation, there are other factors which need to be taken into account before a member of library staff will embark on the information search, e.g.: the quantity, level and format of the required information.

 

==== Quantity  ====


We tend to think that our problem in information searching will be an inability to find '''enough information'''.  This can indeed sometimes be the case.  But using the Internet often results in the reverse situation – an overabundance of results.  Providing too much information is just as unhelpful as providing too little.  You must clarify the scale of information required by the client in order to fully satisfy their needs.  


If the search produces a large amount of information, you should determine whether the client wishes you to undertake any '''filtering''' on their behalf before presenting the information or whether they wish to see the full search results.  If filtering is requested, you must establish with the client the criteria which are to be applied.  Conversely, if the search results are meagre, you should seek guidance from the client as to the possibility of broadening out the search.

 

==== Level ====


It is essential that the information provided is at a '''level of complexity''' which enables the client’s full comprehension but does not patronise the client or tell them what they already know.  


The following points give you some guidance as to the likely level of complexity of information required:


*	the client’s age (But remember age does not automatically bring wisdom! Remember too that some young people can display astonishing knowledge and expertise in subjects which interest them.)
*	the client’s educational attainment
*	the client’s display of specialist knowledge
*	the client’s linguistic ability


Tactful questioning can be used to make an estimation of the points listed above.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, outline a situation where you know all of the above but this knowledge does not tell you the level of complexity of information required.

----
 


==== Other factors affecting level ====


The most obvious example is where the client is making the enquiry on behalf of someone else. Typical examples would include:


*	a '''teacher or lecturer''' looking for material which could be used by school or college students
*	'''parents''' seeking information for use by their child
*	a '''specialist''' in one field who is a beginner in another e.g.: a consultant surgeon investigating horticulture
*	a '''therapist or social worker''' searching for information for one of their clients


Linguistic ability can be misleading.  An overseas visitor with a limited grasp of English or someone with a speech impediment may have '''extensive knowledge''' of the topic under investigation.


You have probably thought of other similar examples.

 

==== Format ====


The results may include information in various formats. There are many formats available, including several as a result of the introduction of ICT.  


*	Your search may direct the client to items of library stock, to be used in the library or borrowed for home use.  This could include:

**	Printed reference sources or information CD-ROMs
**	Books, audio or video material for home borrowing
**	Magazines and journals
**	Pamphlets or leaflets


*	The search results may be bibliographies or lists of website references for the client to follow up.
*	The results may be viewed on screen by client, in the form of text, audio or video.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
If the client wishes to view the results on screen on a computer outside the library, what must you ascertain before directing the client to websites with audio or video content?

----

 

==== Other factors affecting format ====


It will be important to check the '''specification of the client’s computer''' in order to be sure that it will support audio or video applications.  Another point to ask about is whether the client had a broadband connection.  Downloading photographs, movies or sound on a dial-up connection can take considerable lengths of time (It may not even be possible with dial-up technology.) and is costly in terms of telephone charges.


If the search is not carried out with the client present, you must ascertain if the client can '''visit the library''' at a later time to access the search results or if the information must be in a format which can be e-mailed or posted to the client.


Difficulties may arise if the client has expressed an initial preference for a format in which the information is not actually available.  If the information is only available in a '''limited number of formats''', you must alert the client to this and ascertain if any of these formats are acceptable.

=== Constraints ===


There may be a number of constrains on the material required. These include:  


*	deadlines for completion

*	currency of information 

*	language

*	special needs


 
==== Deadlines for completion ====


It is important for you to gauge the '''urgency''' of the enquiry.  This can range from enquiries where information is required immediately through to those where the results may be presented after some time has elapsed.  You should agree with the client on the deadline for completion of the enquiry and also on the action to be taken should this deadline fail to be met for any reason.


If you cannot meet the deadline for completion of the enquiry, clearly it is important to explain to the client the '''reasons''' for this.  Perhaps the enquiry has turned out to be much more complex than was originally envisaged. A specialist member of staff who would normally have handled the enquiry may be absent through sickness. Technical problems resulting in Internet access being temporarily unavailable can also throw your enquiry off schedule. 

 	
----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
You have explained to the client the reasons for not meeting the deadline.  What else should you discuss with the client?

----

 

==== Difficulties in meeting deadlines ====


Although the client may well feel more accepting of the situation if you explain the reasons for your failure to meet the agreed deadline, to some extent this is water under the bridge.   More important to the client is the action you propose to take in order to '''rectify''' the situation. With this in mind you should raise the issue with the client at the earliest possible stage i.e. as soon as you realise that it is unlikely that the original deadline will be achieved.  This gets the client on side and enables you and the client to jointly work out how to make the best of the situation.  It could be that it is possible to complete part of the enquiry within the deadline, in which case you must agree with the client which aspects should be prioritised.  Or perhaps you could arrange for some or all of the information to be provided by another organisation. 


The key to '''client satisfaction''' is to prevent such a situation happening.  Be realistic when agreeing deadlines with the client.  If you are unsure of how long the enquiry will take, say so.  It is better to overestimate than underestimate the time required.  That way the client gets a pleasant surprise when the search results are ready earlier than promised.


 
==== Currency of information  ====



In your search you will be dealing with two kinds of information:

*	'''Dynamic information''' changes frequently (e.g.: current information on news, weather, government policy, share prices) and it is important for you to locate the most up-to-date data or, in a historical enquiry, the information as it was at the time being investigated.

*	'''Static information''' is always the same (e.g.: historical dates, chemical formulae). 


You must also ensure that the client is aware of the need to use '''recently updated sources''' for dynamic information and the implications which this may have in terms of the timescale and cost of the search.  Updating websites to take account of constantly changing information is costly and it may be that there is a charge or a subscription cost to accessing such sites.  This is especially true of sites giving financial and performance information about commercial companies or research results.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Static and dynamic information

 

==== Language ====


Some information may only be available in languages other than English.  You should be certain of the client’s '''fluency''' in these languages before embarking on the search. 


Some websites have a facility which permits you to '''choose the language'''.  This is usually very simple to do.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.1'''

Go to http://www.easyjet.com/en/book/index.asp and view the site in Italian.Look at http://www.artis.nl/ and change the site from Dutch to English.

----


Some search engines permit you to specify the language of the websites.  Some also have a '''translation facility''' from a foreign language into English and from English into a foreign language.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 1.2'''

Try this out in Google. Go to http://www.google.co.uk/ and click the “Search the web” option, then click on “language tools”.Search for websites about '''“días de fiesta”''' (this means holidays) which are written in Spanish and located in Mexico.Choose some Spanish text from one of these websites, copy and paste it into the Translate Box and ask Google to translate it into English for you.

----

 

==== Special needs ====


The reference interview provides the opportunity to establish any special needs of the client.
Some of the most common examples are:


'''Learning difficulty'''

For clients with learning difficulties you might have to look for material of a simpler nature, perhaps with more visual or audio content


'''English as a second language'''

These clients may prefer material which is not in English.  This might mean having the enquirer at your side while you carry out the search so that they can provide assistance with vocabulary.  Alternatively, you may be able to pass the enquiry over to a colleague with language skills. (See earlier guidance on language)


'''Physical impairment'''

Any material found must be accessible to the client e.g.: websites must be accessible to a visually impaired client. (See Outcome 4 for more details of this.)


If you wish to find out more about the skills and knowledge required for this outcome, the following website may prove helpful.


*http://www.hals.lib.tx.us/ref123/2interview.htm

== Demonstrate knowledge of search logic, search engines and features of the Internet ==


=== Introduction ===


This outcome looks at a number of aspects relating to web searches, including the following:


*	Boolean logic
*	Truncation and wildcards
*	Non-obvious search terms
*	Grammar of the Internet
*	Search engine operation
*	Search terms
*	How ranking works
*	Ownership of the web
*	Dark internet and invisible web



==== Boolean logic ====


Boolean operators are used to '''combine search terms''' in order to make the search results more specific. 

----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you name the three Boolean operators?

----

 

==== The Boolean operators ====


There are three Boolean operators -  '''AND, NOT''' and '''OR'''.  We will explore how each of these is used.


'''AND''' is used to link search terms. 


Entering an expression such as '''beans AND toast''' means that results will be returned only where both words appear. Using the '''AND''' operator narrows your search and gives a smaller number of results.


'''OR''' is used to indicate that any of the terms may be present.


Entering an expression such as '''punk OR hair''' means that results with either one or the other (or possibly both) will be returned. Using the '''OR''' operator widens your search and gives a larger number of results.


The '''OR''' operator is particularly useful where a topic might involve synonyms or near synonyms.  A search for '''illness AND felines OR cats''' will be more wide ranging than '''illness AND cats'''.


'''NOT''' is used to exclude terms.


Entering an expression such as '''pop music NOT beatles''' might be devised to return results about pop music but excluding results about the Beatles. Using the '''NOT''' operator narrows your search and gives a smaller number of results.


The '''NOT''' operator is particularly useful when one of your search terms had more than one meaning.  '''Telegraph''' might refer to electronic communication methods but it is also a common name for newspapers.  A search for '''telegraph development NOT newspaper''' will eliminate press information.


In fact the expressions are pretty close to what you would say in natural speech:


*I am looking for references to both beans '''AND''' toast.
*I am looking for sites on either punk '''OR''' hair
*I am looking for information on pop music but '''NOT''' including the Beatles.


Sometimes this is easier to understand in diagrams, so let's have a look at Logic diagrams …
 


==== Logic diagrams: the AND operator ====


Imagine that we have a number of websites which give information about children’s clothes.  Some of these have information only on girls’ clothes, some have information only on boys’ clothes and some have information on both boys’ and girls’ clothes.  In the diagrams the left hand circle represents all records including the word '''girls''' and the right hand circle represents all the records including the word '''boys'''


'''AND'''
[[Image:Venn-and.svg|left]]
 






'''girls AND boys'''

The shaded area represents the records which have information on both girls’ clothing and boys’ clothing.

==== Logic Diagrams: the OR operator ====


'''OR'''
[[Image:Venn-or.svg|left]]
 






'''girls OR boys'''

The shaded area represents the records which have information on only girls’ clothing, only boys’ clothing or on clothing for both boys and girls.

==== Logic Diagrams: the NOT operator ====


'''NOT'''
[[Image:Venn-not.svg|left]] 






'''girls NOT boys'''

The NOT operator excludes all records with information on boys’ clothing, and the shaded area represents the records which have with information about girls’ clothing only.

==== Using multiple Boolean operators ====


It is possible to use multiple Boolean operators.  For example, '''security AND internet AND banking ''' narrows down a search on Internet security issues to records which relate only to bank security on the Internet.


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Boolean Search

QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Boolean Search 2


You can see how the use of Boolean operators allows a very precise search statement to be constructed.  This should produce a smaller number but a better focused set of hits from a search engine.


Boolean search logic underlies the operation of all search engines but the various search engines have different systems of entering a Boolean expression.  Some allow straightforward search statements using capital letters for '''AND, OR''' and '''NOT'''.  However many do not explicitly allow this, the much used Google being one of them.

 

==== Constructing precise Boolean searches ====


It is important to consult the search engine help pages to understand how you can create a precise Boolean search.


There are three approaches:


*1.	Boolean expressions can be '''entered directly''' into the search box.


We have already covered this. Altavista (http://www.altavista.com/) is a search engine which permits this.


*2.	The search engine '''makes assumptions''' about what you mean when you enter search terms.

*3.	There is an Advanced search facility.

 

==== Search engine assumptions  ====


If the search engine makes certain assumptions about what you mean when you enter search terms in a particular way. You must understand the implications of these assumptions.


Basically when you enter more than one term in the search box, the search engine turns this into a Boolean search. The two possibilities are that the engine defaults to an AND or an OR.  


Most of the common search engines default to AND.  So putting in '''carriage clock''' should return results with both words included.  Of course the words may appear in any order and not necessarily next to one another. 

 
Google allows the use of a minus sign (-) to use the NOT operator.  Thus to create the Boolean search expression '''sixties pop NOT beatles''', you would enter '''sixties pop –beatles''' (Note: You must not leave a space between the minus and the search term which you wish to exclude.)


Google assumes that some common words and numbers are never included in the search.  Thus if such a word is particularly required, it must be prefaced by a plus (+) sign.  This is essentially the Boolean '''AND''' operator. 


Using + and – in this way is not as predictable as you might expect in many search situations.  We recommend that they should be used only when there is no alternative.  You can find out more here http://www.google.co.uk/help/basics.html

There are more features of search engines you can utilise have a look at Googles help pages on Punctuation and symbols https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433 and on Search Operators https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/136861?hl=en

==== Advanced search facility ====


Many search engines have an advanced search facility.  This allows many refinements, such as specifying the language, format and age of the sites returned.  Most advanced search facilities however have a set of choices which allow a Boolean search to be created.  

----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, take a look at the advanced search facility on Yahoo:  http://search.yahoo.com/search/options?fr=fp-top&amp;p  

What expressions are used instead of the Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT?

----

==== Advanced searching on Yahoo ====


Yahoo uses


''With all of the words = AND''


''With at least one of the words = OR''


''Without the words = NOT''


By placing search terms in one or more of these categories, you can set up most Boolean statements you will need in your searching.


Note that it is not only search engines which provide these advanced search facilities. They may also be found within a site.  The Houses of Parliament site is an example:

http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/

==== Other points on Boolean searching ====


A good website covering Boolean searching can be found at: http://searchenginewatch.com/2155991

A final point about the grouping of terms is that if you want to find results which include an exact phrase, most search engines let you do this by placing the phrase in quotes.  e.g. 
'''“knitting for children”'''.  In the advanced search facility, you are offered a box title '''“With the exact phrase”'''.


This is particularly useful when searching for names where the forename and surname may not be kept together and in order by a search engine.

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.1'''

Try two searches with '''land act''' and '''“land act”''' as search terms. You will see that the first search produces results relating to Acts of Parliament which relate in some way to land e.g. we found one about stopping dog fouling on public land. The second search leads us to the various Land Acts.

----

=== Truncation and wildcards ===


Traditionally on-line database searching allowed the use of truncation of search terms. This used a symbol such as ~ to represent one or more letters at the beginning or end of a word. For example, ~fuse could lead to refuse, defuse or infuse and refus~ could lead to refuse, refuses, refused or refusing.


In Internet searching this symbol would be called a Wildcard. Two types of Wildcard exist, commonly represented by ? and *.


* ?  indicates the replacement of one character 

* * indicates the replacement of any number of characters.


Wildcard symbols can be used in the middle of a word, not just at the beginning and end, e.g.: ''familiari?e'' for ''familiarise'' and familiarize''.


You must keep in mind the pitfalls of over-enthusiastic use of wildcards or truncation. For instance, '''men*''' would encompass both '''men’s''' and '''menstruate''', the latter term being unlikely to be relevant to a search on a male-related topic.


Of course the search engines have their own rules.  Google for instance does not have this feature. It carries out its own version of using extensions of words automatically.  Many search engines use complex algorithms to produce their results which makes the use of wildcards or truncation inappropriate.    


Most sites which permit wildcard searching will indicate in their Help section which symbols are to be used for these. One search engine which does allow this is Exalead at http://www.exalead.com/search/ 
 

==== Non-obvious search terms ====


A non-obvious search term is a term from some area other than the main search subject which may lead to useful information.  This is different from a '''related term''', say using a particular country instead of its continent.  A non-obvious search term comes from some sort of parallel area which is at first sight not clear.


For example, when looking for information about a particular disease, the name of a '''researcher''' in a similar field would be a non-obvious search term.  It is likely that you would have to be guided by the enquirer about the appropriateness of non-obvious search terms because background knowledge of the topic would be needed in order to think of them.


Another means of finding non-obvious search terms is to browse in directories and portals and see what terms appear in associated sites.


You might like to ask your experienced colleagues to give examples of non-obvious search terms which they have used in the past.

=== Grammar of the Internet ===


The official name for what we commonly refer to as a website address is URL.  '''URL''' stands for '''Uniform Resource Locator'''.  Certain conventions apply to the construction of URLs which can give pointers on their usefulness.  (This is also relevant to the validation of website results – see Outcome 4).  Alan November has called this the Grammar of the Internet.
(see http://novemberlearning.com/educational-resources-for-educators/information-literacy-resources/) or (http://novemberlearning.com/educational-resources-for-educators/information-literacy-resources/4-how-to-read-a-web-address/)


'''http''' stands for '''Hyper Text Transfer Protocol'''.  This simply means your browser is looking for a Hyper Text document.  Hyper Text is the basic coding used to construct web pages


'''www''', as we all know, stands for World Wide Web.


The interesting parts are after http and www.  The next part is called the '''domain name'''.  So for instance '''amazon.co.uk''' 


The first part of the domain name may yield useful clues.  Is it a well-known name?  If you come up with a page on the site http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ it has the authority of being on the BBC website.  Is it a ‘personal’ site giving the opinion of only one person?  The name of the person may be explicit in the domain name e.g. http://www.jamieoliver.com/ 


BUT be terribly careful here.  An individual may set up a website to promote their own ideas and then a rival may set up a website with an equally convincing domain name.  Remember anyone can set up a domain name of their choice and load any sort of rubbish onto the website.

 

==== Using WHOIS ====


It is often possible to find the owner/publisher of a website by doing a WHOIS search on the domain name. An easy route to this can be found as a facility on many website providers sites e.g.: http://www.networksolutions.com/en_US/whois/index.jhtml 


You can enter the US domain name e.g.: '''un.org''' will yield the United Nations Organisation.
Any site with a similar name attempting to fool users into thinking it is the UNO can be checked out in this way.


The UK site for WHOIS searches is: http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/about-domain-names/domain-lookup-whois/whois-tool

or go to www.nominet.org

 	
----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.2'''

Use WHOIS to decide which of the following is the official site of Glasgow Celtic football club.

*http://www.celticfc.co.uk 
*http://www.celtic-mad.co.uk/

----

==== URL extensions ====

The final parts of the URL (separated by dots) are called '''extensions'''.  A well-known example, say for Amazon (www.amazon.co.uk) is '''.uk''' which indicates that the website has been registered as of UK nationality.  All domain names carry a national identifier as the last extension, except for those registered as being of USA nationality.


Taking Amazon as an example:


*www.amazon.com No national identifier signifies the United States

*www.amazon.co.uk  .uk signifies the United Kingdom

*www.amazon.de .de signifies Germany

*www.amazon.fr .fr signifies France

*www.amazon.co.jp .jp signifies Japan


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.3'''

There are many websites which list these geographical extensions. One of these ishttp://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm Use this or any other appropriate site to find the geographic extensions for the following countries:Indonesia, India, Netherlands, Latvia, South Africa

----


Let us look further into www.amazon.co.uk   The extension between the company name and the geographical extension describes the type of organisation involved. “co” is for UK commercial companies.


Each country has its own method for the domain name extensions.  Most of the sites you will be dealing with will be UK or USA based, so let us look at the most common extensions for these countries.

==== United Kingdom extensions ====


'''.gov.uk''' is a national or local government site e.g. www.opsi.gov.uk the Office of Public Sector Information


'''.co.uk''' is a company site e.g. http://www.slc.co.uk/ the student loans company


'''.ac.uk''' is an academic site e.g. http://www.soton.ac.uk/ the University of Southampton


'''.org.uk''' is an organisation, often a charity e.g. http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ the National Trust


'''.ltd.uk''' is a registered company e.g. http://www.evans.ltd.uk/ the women’s fashion outlet


There will be other domain extensions produced in the future.  A recent introduction is .me.uk which is presumably meant for individuals.


However you must note that only some of these extensions can be relied upon.  Only .gov, .ac and .ltd are strictly controlled.  Anyone can set up a website with a .co or .org extension.   In summary, you can use the domain name extensions as good CLUES (which are watertight for .ac.uk and .gov.uk) but be very careful.


 
==== United States extensions ====


Remember sites registered in the US have no geographical extensions.


'''.edu''' is an educational institution e.g.: http://www.wisc.edu/ Wisconsin university


'''.com''' is any company e.g.: www.amazon.com Amazon the Internet company
 

'''.org''' is an organisation (perhaps non-profit) e.g.: http://www.openoffice.org/  the organisation developing Open Office, the free office software suite.


'''.gov''' is a Government agency e.g.: http://www.irs.gov/ Internal Revenue Service


'''.mil''' is a military institution e.g.: http://www.navy.mil/ the US Navy


'''.net''' is used by network providers e.g.: http://www.discountasp.net/ an Internet hosting company


There are several others and some in the pipeline such as '''.info''' and '''.biz''' which will be used for commercial purposes.
 

Not all countries use these descriptive extensions.  Germany and France, for example, only have the country extension. Thus we saw: 


www.amazon.de for Germany and www.amazon.fr for France.


Another point to remember is that there is no requirement to register your site under its country of origin. Some British organisations use the US extensions of .com or .org:


www.debenhams.com/ - the well-known retailer


www.rsc.org/ - the Royal Society of Chemistry


are just two examples.

=== Search engine operation ===


There are essentially three stages involved in search engine operation.  


*1.	Before you come to type in the search terms, there has to have been an enormous '''gathering of data''' about websites carried out by the search engine company.  
*2.	The search engine uses your '''search terms''' to select candidate sites for the results. 
*3.	The search engine returns the '''results''' ranked in some order.


The Internet is continually being scanned by software set up by the search engine company.  This software called a spider or web bot looks for websites and key words to associate with them.  The key words can either be '''metadata''' (descriptive keywords supplied by the site designer) or words in the text. The result is an enormous data bank of website addresses and their corresponding key words.

 

==== Search terms ====


When the user enters the chosen search terms, the search engine uses complex and proprietary methods to select resulting websites which should satisfy the search - basically the engine is trying to match your search terms against its keywords. 


Each search engine has its own ‘secret’ methods, giving weight to particular words, including extensions to search terms such as plurals and so on.  These algorithms may change with time and so different results for the same search terms may be obtained if the search is repeated at a later date.

 

==== How ranking works  ====


Finally before presentation of the resulting websites, ranking occurs.  Ranking is the process by which a search engine '''orders the results''' of a search. You would hope that ranking presents the websites most likely to have the most useful information first.  


However you should be aware that in some cases, commercial sites can '''buy''' a place near the top of a list of websites in a search engine’s results. The implications of this are that the “best” sites do not necessarily appear at the top of the list.  Also the results may appear in a different order at a different date due to ranking changes

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 2.4'''


A useful exercise is to look at the information pages of search engines to understand how they work.  There is usually a section on how to notify the search engine about your website which will have interesting clues as to how the search engine treats new websites.

For each of:

*	Google http://www.google.co.uk/ 
*	Teoma http://www.teoma.com/ 
*	Yahoo http://www.yahoo.com/ 


look for the “about” pages and find out how the engine works and how you submit a website to it.

----

It is important to remember that a search carried out by a particular search engine will return only a sub-set of all the possible results.  This is because, due to practical constraints, the engine cannot index all the pages available in the web.  An issue here is also how quickly the engine reacts to new or altered web pages.  Thus it is always worth using several different search engines for any particular reference enquiry.  Of course, there are sites returned in a search, which when clicked upon do not appear at all because the website has been rearranged or removed since the last indexing.  

 

=== Ownership of the web ===


The questions ‘Who owns the Web?’ or ‘Who owns the Internet?’ come up from time to time.  The implications of the answers are crucial to a good understanding of the nature of information on the Web.


First, let’s get the nomenclature correct.  The Internet is the physical network over which information can flow.  The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of sites where we can access information via the Internet.


So the question is now in two parts.  Who owns the Internet? (i.e.: the physical network) and Who owns the Web? (i.e.: the collection of information we can access)?

 

==== Who owns the Internet? ====


The Internet is an enormous network which has spread throughout the world.  One could say that it is owned by many, many organisations but that is not quite correct.  It would be more accurate to say that many, many organisations own their particular part of it.  


Consider how the Internet evolved.  There were a number of scientific '''research organisations''' each with a network of computers and terminals.  It was agreed to connect these together.  Each organisation owned its own network.  Gradually more and more commercial and organisation networks were created and joined together.  The idea can be likened to the road network on the European Continent.  Each country builds and pays for its own roads but it is possible to drive between any two points on the continent because the road network of each country is connected to the next country.


Luckily it is worthwhile for each part of the Internet to pay its own way to get the benefit of being connected to the whole network.

 

=== Who owns the Web ===


The other part of the question, who owns the websites, is similarly answered.  Each website is owned and financed by an '''organisation or person'''.  They alone have the rights to place their own information on the website.  


So Governments will want to have websites to put up information for their citizens to be able to access.  Commercial organisations will want to put up websites with information about their products to encourage sales.  Other information providers will similarly create sites to distribute knowledge.  Then there are millions of websites which are paid for and run by individuals who want to present information about their hobbies, favourite pop stars, family history etc.


So there is no one person or body responsible for what exists on the web.  It is really quite difficult then to enforce laws proscribing offensive matter because there is no overall control and the offensive site can be situated anywhere in the World.

Tim Berners-Lee was the originator of the web and he saw it as a cooperative space for the sharing of information among researchers.  He was working at CERN.  It still can perform that purpose but the main driving force is now by '''commercial interests'''.  On-line shopping is a very valuable sector nowadays and in the future there will be more and more commercial uses.


However you should be aware of the very different forces influencing what is seen in the search results.  There are individuals, organisations and companies attempting to present their own version of the truth, often in an even-handed way, but occasionally in an insidious and very dangerous manner.  


You must hone your validation techniques so that you can recommend websites which really are what they purport.  The concepts of the ‘grammar of the internet’ can be put into practice here.  Note that there are some truly shocking websites which lurk under the most inoffensive names. We are not going to supply any examples of these!

 

=== Dark internet and the invisible web ===


Search engines have become the main means of accessing information on the Internet.  In the early days directories were used but these have now relinquished first place to the search engines.  This is due to the enormous number of websites.  Their number has grown exponentially and Google tells us that today there are over eight billion of them.  There is no way that all these sites could be viewed by a human reviewer and placed in a directory.  Our ability to find information on the Internet is now very much dependent on the qualities of the chosen search engine.  


This does mean is that, if there are websites which contain information which cannot properly be accessed by the search engine spider, then we will never see it listed in the results.  Indeed there are areas of the web which are never found at all by the searching spiders.  A current problem is with search engines being unable to index '''databases''' and other websites which generate '''dynamic content'''.  In other words, the content is not set out on the pages of the website but is generated each time in response to a user accessing the site via a browser.  Websites with some content not in HTML also cause difficulties.  Examples are proprietary text formats or multimedia. PDF files have also been problematic.


If the search engines are not able to find the information then the only hope of finding its existence is by using a Directory.  There are specialised portals to ‘invisible’ websites. One example is www.invisible-web.net which includes a directory of some of the best resources the Invisible Web has to offer. 


You can read more about the Invisible Web here:

== Create and implement a complex search strategy ==


=== Designing a complex search strategy ===


In Outcome 2 we looked at the theory of search logic – Boolean logic, wildcards, non-obvious search terms, grammar of the Internet, search engine operation and syntax, ranking, ownership of the web, the Dark Internet and invisible web. In Outcome 3 we consider how to apply all of this knowledge in order to design the best strategy for any inquiry.  If you are not confident of your knowledge and understanding of the Outcome 2 topics, you will find in beneficial to revise that section before proceeding further with Outcome 3.  You can return to the ICTL home page by clicking on the ICTL logo at the top left of the page and navigate to Outcome 2 from there.


Complex searches fall into two broad categories:


*1. You may want to locate a '''single piece''' of specific information.

*2. You may be asked by the enquirer to retrieve '''everything you can''' on the topic.



==== Locating a piece of specific information ====


What makes the search complex is that this information is not easy to find. For this type of search, you are likely to use one or more search engines.  The skill lies in '''choosing your search terms''' and combining these into a search statement which will yield the required results.


Alternatively, you may know of an '''authoritative site''' on which this information will definitely be found.  In this case, you will use the URL of the site and then carry out a search within that site for the required information.  You should bookmark sites which you find especially useful.  You can arrange these in your “Favourites” in topic related folders.

 

==== Retrieving everything on a topic ====


You may be asked by the enquirer to retrieve everything you can on the topic. In many cases, to carry out this instruction to the letter would mean presenting the enquirer with an '''overwhelming''' mass of material.  


The skill lies in designing your search so that it results in a number of the most useful and representative sites, which present sufficient, but not too much, information in the format and style best suited to your enquirer.


For this type of search, in addition to search engines, you may need to use '''directories, portals and databases'''.  With practice you will learn which to use first in specific types of enquiries.

 

==== Useful Search Techniques ====


The key to efficient searching is to construct an appropriate search statement by choosing and combining search terms. You will develop your skills in this with practice. Here are some tips from experienced Internet searchers.


1.	Enter what you consider to be the most important search terms first. For example, '''rover cars''' rather than '''cars rover'''

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''

Enter '''rover cars''' and '''cars rover''' into a search engine and compare the first 20 sites listed. You will find the results differ, although some sites appear in the top 20 listed in both searches. '''rover cars''' is more likely to lead to sites which deal solely with Rovers.

----


2.	Enter phrases in quotes (or the equivalent syntax as specific by the search engine). 
Quotes instigate a search for the exact phrase e.g.: '''“internet search techniques”''' will search only for these three words next to each other and in this order. Without quotes, your search will also look for all three words but they could be anywhere in the document e.g.: '''internet search techniques''' could lead to sites discussing police '''search techniques''' for suspected '''internet''' crime. 


3.	If you are specifically seeking UK information, either ask to search UK sites only (if the search engine permits this) or add '''uk''' as a search term


4.	Do not limit yourself to what we, as library staff, think of as indexing terms. Searching the Internet is different from consulting a printed index. So enter as search terms words that you would expect to find in the text. For example, in a search on teenage health problems, you might use search terms such as '''bulimia, anorexia''', or '''eating disorder'''.

 

==== More useful search techniques ====


5.	Look for distinctive, specific words or phrases which apply to your search topic. This is the best way of narrowing the search to relevant sites. '''agoraphobia, English madrigals''' and '''peregrine falcon''' are examples.


6.	Remember synonyms and variant spellings. As much of the Internet content originates from the United States, it is particularly important to remember Americanisms e.g.: '''trunk''' instead of '''boot''' of a car; '''checking account''' instead of '''current account'''. 


7.	When searching on names of individuals or organisations, put these in quotes so that they are a phrase – '''“Melvyn Bragg”;  “Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals”'''


8.	When searching for information on an organisation, especially commercial companies, using the organisation’s name as a search term often does not lead to the organisation’s own web-site but to other sites in which the company is mentioned. (This is a result of the ranking methods used by search engines.)  You may be more successful by using the organisation’s '''postcode''' and/or '''telephone number''' as search terms.


9.	Use '''nouns''' rather than verbs as search terms, wherever possible. The reason underlying this is that nouns are frequently more specific than verbs.


10.	If you are aware that one of your search terms is ambiguous, add additional terms which define the area in which you are interested. You will find that '''“michael jackson” “wine critic” uk''' leads to sites which are less likely to have a connection with the well-known pop singer.



=== Reviewing search terms in the light of results – broader/narrower/related terms ===


It is important to keep reviewing your search strategy and, in particular your search statement, as the search is underway.  Ask yourself: Am I finding too much or too little information?


*	Is the search generating a number of sites which are unconnected, or only loosely related, to the topic?
*	Is there a slant to the topic which my search does not appear to be including?


In order to refine your search, you must be able to use terms which are broader or narrower than or related to your original search term.  The words broader, narrower and related are self-explanatory.  A good example which clearly illustrates the concept is:


initial search term - '''Great Britain'''


broader term - '''United Kingdom''' (The United Kingdom includes Great Britain)


narrower terms – '''England, Scotland, Wales''' (Great Britain includes these three nations)


related term - '''Northern Ireland''' (Northern Ireland is related to Great Britain in that GB and NI make up the United Kingdom)


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Search term terriers


At each stage you should review the search statement, considering if it is appropriate to change the search terms. 

 

==== Changing search terms ====


Where the key terms selected initially are yielding too much information, you should move to the use of narrower terms.  A knowledgeable client might be able to advise you here.  


Where the key terms selected initially are not yielding sufficient information, you should move to the use of broader or related terms. 


Using a directory may help you identify broader, narrower and related terms within its structure.

'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Enter aeroplanes into the search box on Surfwax. When the next screen appears which summarises the search results, click on '''Focus''' and this will show you a selection of Similar, Narrower and Broader terms for '''aeroplanes'''.

----

=== Collection and presentation of results ===


The results of your search should be presented in a structured way which facilitates understanding by the client. 


This may require you to extract or summarise information from one or more sites.  If you do this, it is important for the client to be informed of the source(s) of the information found so that the client may explore the information further if they wish. 


The result of the search might be a '''bibliography''' of web references or references to information sources in print, audio or video formats.  You must quote any such references using a recognised format, for example, as in ISO 690.  ISO 690-2 specifies the elements to be included in bibliographic references to electronic documents.  It sets out a prescribed order for the elements of the reference and establishes conventions for the transcription and presentation of information derived from the source electronic document.

Note that because web pages change constantly and can disappear it is important to give the date on which the site was accessed.

 

==== Presenting information to the client  ====


You should devise a '''logical structure''' for presenting the information to the client. The most commonly used structures are based on these arrangements:


*	Alphabetical
*	Chronological
*	Geographical (grouped by country, region or town)
*	Topical (grouped by sub-topics)
*	Categories (e.g.: type of organisation – public, private, voluntary)
*	Accepted hierarchies (e.g.: biological taxonomy)
*	Sites presenting one point of view, followed by sites presenting the opposing arguments


QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Traffic Congestion Search

== Evaluate websites located in a complex search ==


=== Evaluating websites ===


Information on the Internet presents greater '''problems''' regarding reliability than information found in reference books and other materials in public libraries which have undergone a rigorous selection process.  So ALL information found on websites must be '''critically evaluated'''. The more complex the search, the more necessary it is to apply sophisticated evaluation techniques.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, make a list of criteria you might apply to assess the suitability of a website found as a result of carrying out a complex information search

----

 

==== Evaluation criteria ====


We have noted the following nine criteria:


*	Authority
*	Credibility
*	Accuracy
*	Bias
*	Emphasis
*	Currency
*	Clarity of presentation
*	Use of multimedia 
*	Ease of use for visually impaired clients


We shall now look at each of these in more detail.

 

==== Authority ====


Here you need to consider the '''expertise and reputation''' of the organisations or individuals connected with the website.  When the information is explicitly attributed to an author, you can assess their reputation.  Thus information supplied by an acknowledged expert in a field or found on the website of a well-known and respected organisation carries a lot of weight.


Of course a website may give no direct clues as to '''authorship''' and hence authority.  In this case you can try to find out who owns the site.  In Outcome 2 of this unit, we covered examining the URL of the website and carrying out a WHOIS search to find out this type of information.  


In searching for information about horse breeds you might come across this site:
http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/ 

Remembering Outcome 2, what type of organisation does this URL suggest?

.edu tells us that this site belongs to an educational institution in the Unites States. In fact, the site is that of the Department of Animal Science of Oklahoma State University and therefore you can expect an amount of authority. Note that some colleges and universities allow their students to create home pages which are not authoritative in the least.  You can usually spot this by the name of the student in the URL.



==== Tracing website ownership ====


If you were obtaining information about travelling in South Africa, you might come across this site http://www.springbokatlas.co.za/


From the two domain name extensions you can see that it should be a commercial site (.co) and it is registered as a South African site (.za)  You need to access the '''whois''' for South Africa.  You can do this by searching for it.  You can find it here: http://co.za/whois.shtml

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''

Carry out this whois search.You can see that http://www.springbokatlas.co.za/  is registered by the travel company and at the same address as the travel site in Cape Town.  That gives a bit of confidence that it is a real company and not a fraudulent ‘front’.

----


Of course it is pretty rare that a respected organisation’s website would not very explicitly feature its own name.


You may have to either omit the information found on a non-attributable website or give a strong '''health warning''' to the client regarding its usefulness.



==== Credibility ====


If the author or organisation is unknown to you, you have to check out their credibility.  Regarding a named but unknown author:


*a)	there may be a section on the '''author’s credentials''', giving qualifications etc. – you can check out these details.
*b)	if no credentials are supplied you can simply carry out a search on the '''authors’ name'''.


What would you look for in the search results?


You might be convinced by such things as:

*	positive references to their names in other articles on respected sites
*	biographical information showing that they have relevant qualifications or work experience


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.2'''

When carrying out a search on the history of nuclear physics, you have found a site which quotes extensively from the research of someone called '''Norman Feather'''. Carry out a search to determine who this person was and whether or not he was a respected scientist of his time.

----


A mark of credibility is in the '''citing of sources''' for the information.  If the unknown author cites only her/his own sources then you have no clue.


==== Evaluating credibility ====


You can evaluate a site to some extent by looking for '''references''' to it on other reputable websites.  You can check which sites link to or reference the website being validated simply by searching on its URL.  Enter the URL into a search engine and it should return a list of websites where the URL is found.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.3'''

Try this out by searching on www.qca.org.uk  which is the URL for Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency www.qcda.gov.uk. You will find links to many respectable curriculum related sites, including government departments.

----


We have now covered a '''variety of methods''' which can be used to establish the authority and/or credibility of websites. With experience you will know which method(s) are best in any instance. The next activity provides an opportunity to practice using different methods.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.4'''

Check reliability of each of the following web pages for authority and credibility:


*http://www.nasa.gov 
*http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/dcb/?anchor=rocket_science_open_standards
*http://www.apogeerockets.com/
*http://www.bbg.org/gar2/pestalerts/
*http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/plant_info/pests_diseases
*http://www.care2.com/channels/solutions/outdoors/444
*http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060711093022/http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm

----

==== Accuracy ====


Verifying the accuracy on information in a complex search has particular problems for the information professional who cannot be a subject specialist for every search area.  
The accuracy of factual information can usually be assumed to apply to reputable sites but even then you need to cross check using more than one site wherever possible.
You certainly cannot supply information from sites with dubious authority/credibility without a caveat.


You must of course use your '''common sense'''.  You can detect obvious mistakes e.g. a road-based car is not going to travel at 2000 miles per hour although it might in exceptional circumstances reach 200 mph.  With more specialised data, you may still be able to get a feel for the numbers and simple mistakes will stick out.

 

==== Bias ====


Here you are looking to see if only one side of an argument is given.  Many websites by their very nature present information from only one viewpoint and are thus biased.  It is worth examining the URL and whois information.   A commercial site is not going to criticise its products negatively.  If the site is a personal one, you may be looking at the one-sided views of a ‘crank’.  If the site is sponsored by a dubious organisation, you may only be able to find this out by looking at the whois data. Of course even well known experts can be biased in their opinions.  


While such information need not necessarily be excluded from the results presented to the client, you must '''indicate any identified bias''' and, if possible, provide information from another sources which present opposing points of view.  This is particularly important when the client is seeking information on potentially contentious matters such as politics, religion, race or issues related to pressure groups.


One of the most obvious areas where bias is shown is '''health information'''.  Some sites are simply promoting dubious or unproven therapies with a view to selling their own “medicinal” products. You must make doubly sure that any sites found as a result of a search on a medical topic are reputable.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.5'''

As an exercise in looking for bias in websites, search for a pair of websites giving opposing points of view on the following topics:


*	Cats make better pets than dogs
*	HRT is the only way to go
*	Why wind farms are bad
*	Petrol is greener than diesel


Have a close look at the arguments.  Note how convincing some of these one-sided views can be.


You may be lucky when searching for information in a contentious area in that your initial search results in several sites giving the different viewpoints.  However, if not, you must be prepared to actively seek out websites giving alternative views.

----



==== Emphasis ====


This differs from bias in that it is the omission of information rather than deliberate over-emphasis of one point of view.  For example, US sites may devote little space to British developments.  Another pertinent example is that sites for UK government departments may include information only for England on devolved issues. 


You should be aware that emphasis can be more difficult to detect than bias.  A solution is to apply the technique of cross checking with other sites on the same topic.


Health topics are an excellent example of where emphasis can creep in because of the differing approaches to medicine in different countries.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.6'''

Insert the search term '''“chronic fatigue syndrome”''' into a search engine. Note how the majority of sites which appear are from the United States. Examine the sort of information on these sites. How useful would it be to an enquirer from the UK?

Now repeat the search using '''“chronic fatigue syndrome” uk'''.  Examine the sites listed. We are sure that you will find them more useful sources of information for a client in your library.

----

 

==== Currency ====


In using the Internet you often come across websites which are seriously '''out of date'''.  In fact some of them are actually abandoned and will never be updated again.  When you use websites in your information searching, you must make sure that the information is current.  Of course with a reference book you can look at the publication date.  However for websites it is not just so easy.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, jot down some points you could look for on a website to establish its currency.

---- 



==== Establishing currency ====


We can think of a few possible ways of establishing the currency of a website.  Obviously they depend on finding date information.  This can be explicit:


*	You can check the '''“Last revised”''' date on a website.  Remember though that this may only indicate the last time a change was made to a particular part of the website and that it does not imply that all the content was updated on that date. 
*	You can look to see how recent are the '''publication dates''' of the documents referred to on the site
*	You can look out for '''dates quoted''' within text and make an estimate of currency


If there are no actual dates mentioned, you will need to look for implications of dates.


*	You can look for '''regulations or laws''' mentioned in the site and find their dates of introduction.
*	You can look for the names of '''institutions''' or Government departments.  These do change name and can be used to give a date range.
*	You can look for the names of '''personalities''' involved in the topic which can show currency.
*	Finally you can simply look for reference to '''recent news items''' which will date the site’s information.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.7'''

Look at the following websites which all provide dynamic information and note the evidence which indicates that each has been recently updated.


*http://www.bankofengland.co.uk 
*http://mascotsuk.com/ 
*http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/ 
*http://easyjet.com/en/book/index.asp 
*http://www.blenheimpalace.com/ 

----

==== Currency indicators ====


We noted the following points:


'''Bank of England''' – lists recent working papers, conference reports etc.


'''Mascot''' – states on home page “Site last updated [date]”


'''This is Money''' – states on home page “latest news on [date]”


'''Easyjet''' – the earliest date for booking is today’s date


'''Blenheim Palace''' – the list of events is completely current.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you think of a flaw with the method we used to check the currency of the Blenheim Palace site?

----

 

==== Problems in establishing currency ====


In our Blenheim Palace example, we have established that their events calendar is current.  This site also has a section on Properties to Rent.  We cannot assume from the fact that the Events information is up-to-date that this section too has been updated (although clearly it would make good commercial sense for Blenheim Palace to make sure that this is done!)

 

Previous versions of a Website

The '''wayback machine''' at http://www.archive.org allows previous versions of websites to be browsed so that the history of a site may be viewed.  This can allow you to get a feeling for how it has developed.  It also allows or will allow changes in thought or policy to be observed by looking at a website at different points in time.  You should, however, be aware that this site is by no means comprehensive.  It is possible for website publishers to opt not to be archived.  Also there is a limit to the amount of storage for the past websites.


In a complex search, it is likely that the results of the reference enquiry will consist of a '''list of websites'''.  This differs from a simpler search which might only consist of information which you extract from a website.


Since the client will have to browse the resulting sites, some further points have to be considered as to the suitability of the websites.

 

==== Clarity of presentation ====


You need to choose sites where the information is clearly presented.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list the factors you would consider when assessing whether a site presents information clearly.

----

 

==== Presenting information clearly ====


You will want to make sure that the following points are satisfied:


*	Is it easy to '''glean specific information''' from the site? 
*	Is the site easy to '''navigate''' around?  
*	Does the site '''avoid gimmicks''' such as unnecessary and obscuring graphics?


Unless you are in the position that very few websites provide the required information, you can select the best, which satisfy the above points.


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.8'''

Look at http://www.eca.ac.uk/ It is difficult to find information on the site because of its emphasis on visual gimmicks and use of multiple drop-down menus. Unfortunately a client seeking information on this institution will have little choice but to persevere in using the site.

----

 

==== Use of multimedia ====


The appropriate use of '''multimedia''' can enhance understanding and indeed provide additional information.  However, some sites include multimedia such as Flash introductions, which at best are annoying and at worst put off the client due to the delays caused.  If the connection to the Internet is not fast broadband, then the delays can be intolerable.  


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.9'''

Here is an example of a site from a firm offering web design services 

http://www.transcena.co.uk 

We think its Flash introduction is unnecessary and does not add anything to the information provided. See if you agree with us.

----


Some sites offer the option of a Flash and non-Flash version. Look at http://web.archive.org/web/20050113090553/http://www.blackburn.ac.uk/  and compare the operation of both versions. Which do you prefer?


For some searches, information in multi-media format is useful or even essential.  You can make this one of your selection criteria.  Often just typing video as one of your search terms will lead to sites which have video clips (It can, of course, also lead to sites which are selling videos).  We tried jfk, assassination, and video which led amongst others to
http://www.courttv.com/onair/shows/kennedy/vintage_video.html where video clips can be played.


If sound files or sound tracks of movie clips are used, these may require loudspeakers to be available or, more likely in libraries, headsets to be used.  Clearly sites where essential information is presented audibly are not appropriate for the hearing impaired.

==== Ease of use for visually impaired clients ====


There are two main areas which should be considered for the visually impaired client.  


It may be that a client can use text on the monitor screen if it is very clear and perhaps large size.  Here it is necessary to check that the website text is not partly obscured by background graphics such as a '''watermark effect'''.  Other considerations are whether the text size can be increased by the user and if there is a text only version of the website. 


The colour of the text and the background can also influence visibility. It is generally accepted that bright orange, yellow and red backgrounds make text difficult to read. 
http://web.archive.org/web/20040710220451/http://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/courses/details.php?s=3 is an example.


Another practice to be avoided is white or pastel coloured text on a dark background.
In a previous version http://web.archive.org/web/20040101101704/http://battle1066.com/ the banner headline above the coat of arms in this site is difficult for even those with perfect vision. You can compare this with the latest version at http://www.battle1066.com/
http://www.abelard.org/technology/net-searching.php Much of the text here is almost illegible.


At the level where the client is unable to read text from a monitor screen a '''text to speech''' accessory must be used.  For this to be a successful experience, the website must be clearly laid out.  Also it is important that all graphics have text descriptions.  This is vital when it comes to the use of graphics in navigation through the website.


There are '''guidelines for accessibility''' and although you cannot be an expert in this area, you will find useful information on the following websites:


Two sites covering all accessibility issues:
http://www.coi.gov.uk
and
http://www.becta.org.uk/


A commercial site explains its approach
http://www.santander.co.uk


The RNIB site
http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_rnib008789.hcsp


Recent research by the '''Museums, Libraries and Archives Council''' tested websites in the museums, libraries and archives sector and found that only 3% of these met the accessibility criteria set for government websites. You can read more about this research at:
http://web.archive.org/web/20050503012040/http://www.egovmonitor.com/reports/rep11278.pdf

== Reviewing the Effectiveness of a Search Strategy ==


=== Estimating the effectiveness of a search strategy ===


The '''client’s requirements''' should have been clearly specified during the reference interview. The first stage in evaluation is to revisit that initial interview and consider if you did indeed fully explore with the client all the aspects of the query.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 5.1'''

Think of any complex information searches which you have recently carried out.  Look back to your initial reference interviews with the clients.  Could these have been improved in any way?  Note down what you could do better next time.

----


Next you must '''review the results of the search''' against the client’s requirements and consider the success of the search in these terms. 


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, outline the criteria which you would use to judge whether your search strategy has been successful.

---- 



==== Criteria for success ====


We suggest that you would consider:


*	Did the search produce results which were '''relevant''' to the client’s needs?
*	Did the search produce '''comprehensive information'''? i.e.: enough for the client’s needs?
*	And conversely, were the search results '''sifted''' in order to avoid deluging the client with information?
*	Did the search produce information which was '''reliable, up-to-date''' and '''covered all aspects''' of the topic?
*	Did you constantly have to '''modify the search strategy''' during the course of the search? And were these modifications a result of '''deficiencies''' in your original strategy?
*	Did you meet the client’s '''deadlines''' for producing the results? 
*	Did your search strategy mean that the search was carried out as '''quickly and efficiently''' as possible?


You should have no difficulty in applying the majority of the above criteria when considering the '''effectiveness''' of your search. The final criteria relating to time and speed may be less familiar to you. 

 

==== Time spent searching ====


Time spent on a search is a '''key evaluation criterion'''.  Given enough time an unskilled searcher could probably produce the required results, but an information professional should be able to produce the requested information much more quickly.  


You should consider if your search strategy produced the results in the minimum possible time or whether any modifications of the search strategy would have yielded speedier results. Key to this is the choice of search engines, directories, search terms and logic.


Finally, do remember that '''it may not be possible''' in all cases to fully satisfy the client’s requirements. (If this is the case, you will have explained the reasons for this to the client, e.g. information does not exist in the format specified, and proposed some alternatives if this is possible.)  


Failing to fully satisfy the client’s requirements is not in itself a criticism of your search strategy. If the information does not exist, the best search strategy you can devise will not uncover it.  It does, however, give you a pointer for the next time you are asked to carry out a similar information search.  If you have doubts as to the '''existence''' of the information requested, share this with the client right at the start so that they are not disappointed later.



=== Measuring the cost of a search ===


The cost of an information search arises from two components.  The '''cost of staff time''' (yourself and colleagues) dedicated to the search and '''direct costs''', i.e.: anything which has actually to be paid for.


An effective search strategy should mean that staff time input is '''minimised''', thus keeping down the cost of the search.  It can be easy to overlook the cost to the library service of staff time because public libraries do not normally charge for this.  Commercial libraries often ask library and information staff to log the time spent on information searches and the enquirer’s department is then billed for this.  


We are not suggesting that you formally log time spent – merely that you keep aware of roughly how much time you are devoting to any information search and whether this is justified.  If you find yourself devoting an '''inordinate amount of time''' to any search, ask yourself whether you should:
 

*	modify your search strategy
*	ask advice from a more experienced colleague 
*	ask a more experienced colleague to take over the search for you
*	abandon the search at this point, explaining the reasons for this to the client.


----

[[Image:T_cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down any direct costs which you think could be associated with an information search on the Internet?

----

 

==== Direct costs ====


Direct costs could include:


*	Telecommunications charges
*	Fees for subscription sites
*	Charges to download particular documents
*	“Pay-per-view” costs for commercial sites


Telecommunications charges will have been paid by your library service. They represent a '''fixed overhead''' and so you do not need to try to calculate them for any search.


Where a library service, has decided to subscribe to a particular information source, there will be good reasons for this. A knowledgeable person has decided that the subscription site provides better information than is available on free sites. Indeed the subscription service may provide the only information available. You should therefore familiarise yourself with the '''content of subscription sites''' and their '''charging structures'''.


'''Downloading''' and '''pay-per-view''' charges can mount up.  Before using such information, always consider if there is an appropriate alternative source which is free of charge. An interesting article on the development of &quot;pay for content&quot; Internet provision is found at
http://web.archive.org/web/20040206000441/http://www.demonatthus.net/news/n-a030407a.html


Another cost which can be considerable relates to '''printing''' and/or copying the search results. This can be minimised if you supply the results to the client in electronic format wherever possible.

== Use ICT to set up current awareness and alerting services ==


=== Determining current awareness requirements of clients ===


You should begin by establishing an '''information profile''' for the client. This will provide information about what information the client needs and the quantity, level and format of the required information. It will also specify any constraints, such as deadlines for completion, currency of information and language and note any special needs that the client might have:


'''Example Information Profile'''


The following information profile might suit a client who wants to be kept up to date on happenings in the Scottish Parliament:


'''Client name:'''		Joseph Grant

'''Email address:'''		jgrant@btinternet.com

'''Age:'''			35

'''Education:'''		Completed six years secondary school

'''Information Required:'''	Regular updates re Scottish Parliament

'''Quantity:'''		Brief summary with links to full stories

'''Level:'''			Literate adult

'''Format:'''			Daily digest

'''Deadlines:'''		Wants to start ASAP

'''Currency:'''		Updated daily

'''Language:'''		English

'''Special Needs:'''		None
 

You can find an example of online profile form at:


http://web.archive.org/web/20060705204606/http://sciweb.lib.umn.edu/general/profile.phtml 

 

==== Establishing an information profile ====


Establishing an information profile uses essentially the same skills and techniques as the first part of this unit, i.e.:


*	Reference interview techniques 
*	Eliciting information and advice from clients
*	Determining the nature of detailed information to be provided– quantity, level, format
*	Constraints – deadlines for completion, currency of information and language
*	Special needs of the client


If you want to review these topics, you can click the ICTL logo at the top left of the page to return to the Unit 6 home page and navigate from there to Outcome 1 of this unit.


In addition to establishing the nature of information required, what else would you need to agree with the client in order to provide a satisfactory current awareness service?

It is also essential that you should agree the update frequency with the client. e.g.: weekly, monthly, whenever a change occurs, on-demand etc.

 

==== Costs  ====


You should take into account the '''costs''' (in staff time or subscriptions to commercial services) of providing updates and should be realistic about their frequency. Remember that your time costs money and it is unrealistic to spend disproportionate amounts of it in meeting the needs of a small number of clients.
 

Also, commercial services can be '''expensive to use''': if you do not already subscribe to a service, it may be uneconomical to do so to meet the needs of a small number of clients. Some commercial services also incur a usage charge, in which case you must ensure that this is not excessive.

=== News services ===


A news service is one which provides regular updates on topics commonly regarded as news, i.e.: those topics covered in newspapers and television or radio news broadcasts, such as current events, politics, sport etc.


News is a distinct category for current awareness because of the need for '''immediate notification''' of breaking events as well as '''regular summaries'''.  There are a wide variety of news sites to choose from. 


Three '''methods of delivery''' may be distinguished:  


*	'''daily digest''' via e-mail. This gives the subscriber a brief daily summary of newsworthy events, usually with links to more detailed stories.

*	'''breaking news events''' by e-mail. This lets you receive instant details of new stories, more or less as they break

*	'''online news ticker''' permanently visible on the computer monitor. This scrolls news headlines continuously across the bottom of the screen and is updated with new stories as they happen. It often provides hotlinks to more detailed coverage.


All three have their own advantages and disadvantages. The daily digest is non-intrusive and allows you to follow up such stories as you choose, but you only receive updates once a day. The breaking events coverage lets you know as soon as something happens, but you have to check your email to see it. The online news ticker lets you know about new stories instantly, but some people find it an annoyance having it on the screen all the time.


Some e-mail delivery services allow the use of filters, which give an element of choice of news topics delivered. If you are setting up a news delivery service for a client, it is vital that you use this filtering in order to tailor the service to the client’s needs.



==== Daily digests ====


You can obtain a daily digest from the following sources:

'''ACTIVITY 6.3'''

Go to http://www.journalismnet.com/choose/newstickers.htm and look at the tickers. Which ones look as if they might be useful to you and why?

----

==== News aggregators ====


'''news aggregators''', use an XML format such as RSS, to receive relevant news headlines. 


'''XML''' stands for '''eXtensible Markup Language''' and is a standard format for computer-readable documents which makes it straightforward to process them automatically. 


'''RSS''' stands for '''Really Simple Syndication'''. It's a method of describing news or other Web content that is available for syndicating (i.e.: feeding or distributing) from an online publisher to Web users. The term “syndication” derives from the newspaper industry practice of sharing content between different papers. A column or a cartoon (such as Peanuts) which appears in numerous different papers is described as “syndicated”.


There is a useful introductory article at:


http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/w-rss.html?dwzone=web 


and another at:


http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm 

To read rss feeds sign up to a free account at netvibes

A '''news aggregator''' is a software application that collects syndicated content from a variety of sources and displays it as a single web page. A website may incorporate aggregator features by republishing syndicated content on one or more of its pages. Aggregator features also can be added to other client software, such as Web browsers, e-mail clients, weblog creation programs, or media player programs, to allow these programs to display syndicated content.

==== News providers ====


Another way to make the topic choice more focused is by the choice of provider.  The FT ticker would be a good choice for stock market data.  If you carry out a simple search on Google, an array of sites providing specialised news will be found, e.g.: www.bunkerworld.com  offers both an e-mail delivery service and a news ticker devoted to the happenings in the world of bunker fuel.

=== Website updating services ===


Some commercial websites offer an alerting service detailing new products.  Of particular interest to library professionals are the alerting services of journal and book publishers.  For journals, it is possible to get the table of contents and sometimes abstracts of the articles. One example is the content alerting feature in http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/  for Oxford University Press Journals.  


----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 6.5'''

Go to  http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/  and sign up for alerts for one or more of the OUP journals.

----


For book publisher alerting services it is possible to include filters to receive information on particular types of books. An example is the Mailing List feature on www.heinemann.com  Booksellers also offer alerting services, with www.amazon.co.uk  being an obvious example.


----

Alerting services are not confined to books and journals. For example, Stay Smart Online (http://www.ssoalertservice.net.au/view/80956e10461f4446acbcab5cae348a0c) is a Australian Government service, designed to provide small businesses with accurate, plain English advice to help protect computers, mobile phones and other devices from malicious attack. 




==== Monitoring websites ====


The contents of websites change and often do so at unpredictable intervals.  If you want to be notified when the contents of a website change, without having to connect to it frequently to check, you can set up an '''alert''' to notify you of any changes. If an alert can be set up it can solve two problems.  Firstly if there is a substantial change to an often-recommended site, you can check up to see if must be re-evaluated for recommendation.  Secondly, if data contained in a site is updated at say annual intervals, it is useful to know when the new data becomes available.  This is similar to knowing that a new edition of a reference work has been published and needs to be purchased.


Some websites offer to notify subscribers automatically if changes are made, but there are a number of tools available which allow you to monitor changes on any website, e.g.:


*Website Watcher 	http://www.aignes.com/features.htm 

*Check and Get:		http://activeurls.com/en/

=== Creating a current awareness system for your own organisation ===


A '''current awareness service''' is a service or publication designed to alert scholars, researchers, readers, customers, or employees to recently published literature in their specialist field(s). Current awareness systems are usually available in special libraries serving companies, organizations, and institutions in which access to current information is essential. Such services can be tailored to fit the interest profile of a specific individual or group. Some online catalogues and bibliographic databases include a &quot;preferred searches&quot; option that allows the library user to archive search statements and re-execute them as needed. Current awareness services are sometimes referred to as '''selective dissemination of information (SDI)'''.


Internal '''current awareness systems''' have traditionally involved the physical circulation of print materials to clients. These have now been replaced by electronic versions. This includes identification of relevant materials which match the client’s information profile. The materials might include internal documents in electronic or print format.
 

You should be able to identify relevant print or non-print materials from journals, reports etc. Where such are available only in print format, you should give a reference and a brief description. You should be able to operate a system for e-mailing information to clients within the organisation at agreed intervals and set up web-sourced current awareness services for internal clients.


You can find lots of links relating to current awareness services for librarians at the following sites:


http://www.city.academic.gr/special/libproject/LIBRARY_SITE/information_services/LIBRARY_SERVICES/alerting_services.htm 


http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/dis/disresearch/ascas.html


Although these are university library sites, much of the content is applicable to public libraries.


You can find a long list of available current awareness and alerting services at the following location:

An important issue for the aeronautical industry is the reduction of aircraft noise. The characteristics of the turbomachinery noise are to be studied. The rotor/stator interaction is a predominant part of the noise emission.
We will present an introduction to these interaction theory, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction.

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rotor/Stator_Interaction&amp;action=edit
Edit this page

== Noise emission of a Rotor-Stator mechanism ==


A Rotor wake induces on the downstream Stator blades a fluctuating vane loading, which is directly linked to the noise emission.

We consider a B blades Rotor (at a rotation speed of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) and a V blades stator, in a unique Rotor/Stator configuration. The source frequencies are multiples of &lt;math&gt;B \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For the moment we don’t have access to the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. The noise frequencies are also &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, not depending on the number of blades of the stator. Nevertheless, this number V has a predominant role in the noise levels (&lt;math&gt;P_{m}&lt;/math&gt;) and directivity, as it will be discussed later.



''Example''

''For an airplane air-conditioning ventilator, reasonable data are :''

''&lt;math&gt;B=13&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 12000&lt;/math&gt; rnd/min''

''The blade passing frequency is 2600 Hz, so we only have to include the first two multiples (2600 Hz and 5200 Hz), because of the human ear high-sensibility limit. We have to study the frequencies m=1 and m=2.''





== Optimization of the number of blades ==


As the source levels can't be easily modified, we have to focuse on the interaction between those levels and the noise levels.

The transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; contains the following part :


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{s =  - \infty }^{s =  + \infty } {e^{ - {{i(mB - sV)\pi } \over 2}} J_{mB - sV} } (mBM)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



Where m is the Mach number and &lt;math&gt;J_{mB - sV}&lt;/math&gt; the Bessel function of mB-sV order. In order to minimize the influence of the transfer function, the goal is to reduce the value of this Bessel function. To do so, the argument must be smaller than the order of the Bessel function.



''Back to the example :''

''For m=1, with a Mach number M=0.3, the argument of the Bessel function is about 4. We have to avoid having mB-sV inferior than 4. If V=10, we have 13-1x10=3, so there will be a noisy mode. If V=19, the minimum of mB-sV is 6, and the noise emission will be limited.''


''Remark :''

''The case that is to be strictly avoided is when mB-sV can be nul, which causes the order of the Bessel function to be 0. As a consequence, we have to take care having B and V prime numbers.''




== Determination of source levels ==


The minimization of the transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; is a great step in the process of reducing the noise emission. Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, we also have to predict the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significative values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, we will not consider the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV.
The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory,which will not be explicited here.




== Directivity ==


All this study was made for a privilegiate direction : the axis of the Rotor/Stator. All the results are acceptable when the noise reduction is ought to be in this direction. In the case where the noise to reduce is perpendicular to the axis, the results are very different, as those figures shown :


For B=13 and V=13, which is the worst case, we see that the sound level is very high on the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:1313bis.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


For B=13 and V=19, the sound level is very low on the axis but high perpendicularly to the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = Pi/2&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:1319bis.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Tutorial 1:  Creating a Windows program in Dev – C++==

This chapter will cover programming with the Win32 API.

===Setting up Dev – C++===

First open up Dev – C++.  When it opens up, click on the top menu bar File, New, Project.  Make sure the Basic tab is selected and click on Windows Application.  Then give it a name and press OK.  Then in the next dialog, choose a location on your computer to save and then press Save:

[[Image:GLstart_tut1_1.jpg]]

After you do that, your project loads up and you get a default source file with windows code already in it.  Right – click the tab main.cpp above the source file and click Close.  When it asks you to save changes, click on No.

To add a new source file to the project, go to the top menu bar and click on File, New, Source File.  It will ask you if you want to add the source file to the project.  Click Yes.  Now you will have a blank source file to edit.  Before we start coding, click on File, Save.  It will ask you where you  want to save your source file.  Make sure you save it in the same place you put your Dev – C++ project.  Name it something like ”winmain” and click Save.  Now that we got a blank source file ready, we can start coding our window.

The first line of the source file should have the windows header “windows.h” included:

 #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

This header includes all the functions and structures we need so far to program in Windows.

Before we go on, there are some things we need to discuss about Window events.

Unlike a standard command – line program, a Windows program has many events happening at once.  One example would be the fact that a Window has to constantly repaint the background of itself.  This we won’t worry about right now.  But there are other events such as a user pressing a button on the window, a user right – clicking with the mouse, etc…  The event that we are going to worry about in this lesson is when the user hits the X button on the top – right of the window to exit the program.  We have to tell the Operating System (Windows) that when the user does that, the program should quit.  The function in Windows that handles these types of events is called a Window Procedure.  We are going to define this function next.  Also note that Windows doesn’t call these actions “events”, but rather they call them messages.  Messages are events.  We will be using the term “messages” throughout the lessons.  Now let’s start coding the Window Procedure.

The return value of the Window Procedure is the result of the processing of the messages which is returned to the WinMain() function (more on this later):

 LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(
 
     HWND hwnd,	// handle of window
     UINT uMsg,	// message identifier
     WPARAM wParam,	// first message parameter
     LPARAM lParam 	// second message parameter
    );

I will explain these parameters in a minute.  But this is how you declare the Window Procedure.  So right underneath the inclusion of the Windows header, put this in:

 LRESULT CALLBACK WinProc(HWND hWnd,
                          UINT msg,
                          WPARAM wParam,
                          LPARAM lParam)
 {

Notice that you can name the function whatever you want.  Here we named it “WinProc”.  Easy to remember right?  We need this name when we create the actual window.  Now let me explain the different parameters there:

HWND hWnd is short for a “handle to a window”.  Basically this is the actual window object itself.  This handle stores the window in it.

UINT msg is the actual message we will be processing.  There are tons and tons of messages we can process, but we will only worry about one in this lesson.

WPARAM wParam and LPARAM lParam are different types of message information.  We won’t be using these variables in this lesson.  I will explain them some other time.

Now within the Message Procedure we need some way of defining what to do for a certain message.  We will use the switch command to sort out these messages:

      switch(msg)
      {

Now we will put in a case statement for the one message we want to handle, which is when the user exits the program.  This message has an ID value of WM_DESTROY.  When we are in its case statement, we put in a function to quit the program.  We will use the PostQuitMessage() function which takes as a single parameter the exit code, which is 0:

           case WM_DESTROY:
                PostQuitMessage(0);
                break;
           
           default: break;
      }

Above we put the quitting message and then ended the switch statement.  Now that we took care of that message, we are done with the Window Procedure.  One last thing we have to do though is return the results of our message processing to the WinMain function.  For this we return the DefWindowProc() function:

 LRESULT DefWindowProc(
 
     HWND hWnd,	// handle to window
     UINT Msg,	// message identifier
     WPARAM wParam,	// first message parameter
     LPARAM lParam 	// second message parameter
    );

As you can see this function takes the same parameters as the window procedure itself.  So all you have to do is fill it in with the same parameters you did in the Window Procedure declaration:

 return DefWindowProc(hWnd,msg,wParam,lParam);
 }

Now this finally completes our Window Procedure.  Now lets move on to the WinMain() function.


WinMain

The WinMain() function is sort of like the main() function in a regular C or C++ program.  It is the entry point for all Windows programs.  But it is a bit more complex to set up.  Here is its prototype:

 int WINAPI WinMain(
 
     HINSTANCE hInstance,	// handle to current instance
     HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,	// handle to previous instance
     LPSTR lpCmdLine,	// pointer to command line
     int nCmdShow 	// show state of window
    );

Let me explain the parameters:

HINSTANCE hInstance keeps track of the window.  Let me explain this better.  It keeps track of the instance, or the appearance, of the window.  This is a very hard concept to explain.  We will go over this some more later.

HINSTANCE hPrevInstance is not really used.

LPSTR lpCmdLine specifies command – line arguments for the program.  We won’t need to worry about this.

int nCmdShow is the way that the window is to be shown.  We won’t mess with this yet.

After the message procedure type in the initialization for the WinMain() function:

 int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance,
                    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                    LPSTR lpCmdLine,
                    int nShowCmd)
 {

Now within the WinMain() function we have to declare three very important variables.  Put this in right after the WinMain() initialization:

      HWND hWnd;
      WNDCLASSEX wcex;
      MSG msg;

Let me explain these variables:

HWND hWnd we already explained in the message procedure.  It is the handle that stores the window itself.

WNDCLASSEX wcex is the actual window structure.  This structure, which you define, sets certain properties of the window.  We will be filling in this structure in a minute.

MSG msg is the message structure like the one in the message procedure.  This particular structure contains fields such as the actual message itself.  We will be using this later in the WinMain() function.

Now that we got those variables, lets define that WNDCLASSEX structure.  Here is the prototype of the WNDCLASSEX structure:

 typedef struct _WNDCLASSEX {    // wc  
     UINT    cbSize; 
     UINT    style; 
     WNDPROC lpfnWndProc; 
     int     cbClsExtra; 
     int     cbWndExtra; 
     HANDLE  hInstance; 
     HICON   hIcon; 
     HCURSOR hCursor; 
     HBRUSH  hbrBackground; 
     LPCTSTR lpszMenuName; 
     LPCTSTR lpszClassName; 
     HICON   hIconSm; 
 } WNDCLASSEX;

Let me show you what to fill in these properties with:

-	UINT cbSize is the size of the structure itself.
-	UINT style is the window styles.  There are quite a few options for this.  We will use the CS_HREDRAW and CS_VREDRAW to allow the window to be resized horizontally and vertically.
-	WNDPROC lpfnWndProc is the name of the message procedure you want to link to.  We already created this in the beginning so put the name of it (WinProc) in here.
-	int cbClsExtra and int cbWndExtra will not be used so it will be set to 0 for both of them.
-	HANDLE hInstance is the instance handle we created in the declaration of WinMain.  Just put in the name we gave it (hInstance) in this property.
-	HICON hIcon is the big icon we want to use for the program.  For this we will load a standard icon using the LoadIcon() function which takes as parameters: the HINSTANCE of the icon (we set this to NULL) and the Icon name (set to IDI_APPLICATION for a standard windows icon)
-	HCURSOR hCursor is the mouse cursor we want to use.  For this we use the LoadCursor() function which takes as parameters:  HINSTANCE of Cursor (set to NULL) and the name of the Cursor ( IDC_ARROW for a standard Windows arrow)
-	HBRUSH hbrBackground is the color we want for the background.  We get this color by using the GetStockObject() function which takes as parameter the name of the brush (we set this to GRAY_BRUSH) and type cast it to HBRUSH type.
-	LPCTSTR lpszMenuName identifies the menu we want to use in our program.  Since we don’t have one, we set this to NULL.
-	LPCTSTR lpszClassName is a string for the name of the Windows class that identifies the window.  We will need this name later when we create the window.  Set it to “WinClass”.
-	HICON hIconSm is the small icon to use for the program.  Set this to NULL for a default Icon.

So here is the whole structure defined and ready to be typed:

      wcex.cbSize = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
      wcex.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW;
      wcex.lpfnWndProc = WinProc;
      wcex.cbClsExtra = 0;
      wcex.cbWndExtra = 0;
      wcex.hInstance = hInstance;
      wcex.hIcon = LoadIcon(NULL,IDI_APPLICATION);
      wcex.hCursor = LoadCursor(NULL,IDC_ARROW);
      wcex.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH) GetStockObject(GRAY_BRUSH);
      wcex.lpszMenuName = NULL;
      wcex.lpszClassName = &quot;WinClass&quot;;
      wcex.hIconSm = NULL;

After the defining of the WNDCLASSEX structure, we have to register it with the RegisterClassEx() function, which takes as a single parameter a pointer to the WNDCLASSEX structure we want to register:

      RegisterClassEx(&amp;wcex);

Now we go on to actually create the window.  Remember that HWND (handle to window) that we created at the beginning of the WinMain() function?  Well, we are going to set that equal to the window we are about to create using the CreateWindow() function:

 HWND CreateWindow(
 
     LPCTSTR lpClassName,	// pointer to registered class name
     LPCTSTR lpWindowName,	// pointer to window name
     DWORD dwStyle,	// window style
     int x,	// horizontal position of window
     int y,	// vertical position of window
     int nWidth,	// window width
     int nHeight,	// window height
     HWND hWndParent,	// handle to parent or owner window
     HMENU hMenu,	// handle to menu or child-window identifier
     HANDLE hInstance,	// handle to application instance
     LPVOID lpParam 	// pointer to window-creation data
    );

Let me explain these parameters:

-	LPCTSTR lpClassName is the name of the window class we defined in the definition of the WNDCLASSEX structure (“WinClass”)
-	LPCTSTR lpWindowName is the string that appears on the title bar of the window.  For now, set it to “Window”
-	DWORD dwStyle is specifies certain window styles.  There are a bunch of these, but for now we will set it to WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW for the window to appear with a border and a minimize,maximize, and close button just like a standard windows application.
-	int x and int y are the X and Y locations starting from the top – left corner of the screen of the window.  For now we set it to 0 and 0.
-	int nWidth and int nHeight are the height and width in pixels of the window.  For now set it to 400 and 400.
-	HWND hWndParent is a window handle to a parent window.  Since we are only creating a single window, set it to NULL to indicate there is no parent window.
-	HMENU hMenu identifies a menu to use.  Since we have none, set it to NULL.
-	HANDLE hInstance is the instance handle that we set to the WNDCLASSEX structure (hInstance).
-	LPVOID lpParam is not needed, so set it to NULL.

Here is the whole function with the right parameters passed:

      hWnd = CreateWindow(&quot;WinClass&quot;,&quot;My Window&quot;,
             WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,0,0,400,400,NULL,NULL,
             hInstance,NULL);

Just to be on the safe side, lets make sure that the window was created successfully.  If the CreateWindow() function was successful, the window handle (hWnd) would have a window attached to it.  If CreateWindow() wasn’t successful, then the window handle would have a value of NULL in it.  So first, check for a value of NULL in the window handle with an IF statement:

      if(hWnd == NULL)
      {

Now if the window handle was NULL, we need to tell the user about the error and close the program down.  First to inform the user of the problem, we can use a popup message box.  For that we use the MessageBox() function:

 int MessageBox(
 
     HWND hWnd,	// handle of owner window
     LPCTSTR lpText,	// address of text in message box
     LPCTSTR lpCaption,	// address of title of message box  
     UINT uType 	// style of message box
    );

The first parameter is the window handle of the window the message box is coming from.  Since if the window handle is NULL, which we are checking for, put in NULL for this value.  The second parameter, lpText, is the main text in the message box dialog.  For this put in “Error:  Couldn’t create window”.  The third parameter, lpCaption, is the title caption on the top of the message box.  Set this to “ERROR”.  The final parameter, uType, is the message box style.  Here you can identify the types of buttons for the user to press on the message box and an icon to appear on the message box.  For now, set this to MB_OK for just an OK button on there.
After we create the message box, we have to quit the program.  Just like a standard C++ main() function, when an error occurs we put ”return -1” instead of “return 0” to tell the Operating System we are quitting the program with an error.  So after the message box put “return 0”:

              MessageBox(NULL,&quot;Error: Unable to create Window&quot;,&quot;ERROR&quot;,MB_OK);
              return -1;
      }

Now, assuming the window was created successfully, we need to actually show it.  We use the ShowWindow() function for that:

 BOOL ShowWindow(
 
     HWND hWnd,	// handle of window
     int nCmdShow 	// show state of window
    );

The first parameter is the handle to the window we want to show (hWnd).  The second parameter is the variable we created at the initialization of the WinMain() function (nShowCmd):

      ShowWindow(hWnd,nShowCmd);

Right after this, we should handle any updates to the window by using the UpdateWindow() function which takes as a single parameter the handle of the window to update(hWnd):

      UpdateWindow(hWnd);

Now that our window is shown, we need to prevent the program from exiting so our window stays on the screen.  To do that we create a main loop.  The way I am going to do the loop is create a while loop with a condition of 1 so that the loop is infinite:

      while(1)
      {

Now while the loop is going, we need some way to check for if a user quit the program.  To do that we have to check the messages being sent to see if one was a quit message.  For that we use the PeekMessage() function:

 BOOL PeekMessage(
 
     LPMSG lpMsg,	// pointer to structure for message
     HWND hWnd,	// handle to window
     UINT wMsgFilterMin,	// first message
     UINT wMsgFilterMax,	// last message
     UINT wRemoveMsg 	// removal flags
    );
-	LPMSG lpMsg is a pointer to the message structure that we created at the beginning of the WinMain() function (msg)
-	HWND hWnd is the window that we want the messages from processed.  You can put NULL in here to select the default window
-	UINT wMsgFilterMin and UINT wMsgFilterMax specify the minimum and maximum ranges for the messages to be processed.  Since we want to process all messages, put 0 in for both of these parameters
-	UINT wRemoveMsg determines how messages are handled after they are processed.  We will use the value PM_REMOVE telling it to remove messages after they are processed.

Since the PeekMessage() function returns a Boolean value determining if it was successful or not, lets put it in an IF Statement to assure that it ran successfully:

              if(PeekMessage(&amp;msg,NULL,0,0,PM_REMOVE))
              {

If a message was processed, we need to only check to see if that message was a Quit message.  We can do that by checking the message property of the MSG structure we created earlier (msg).  The message we are checking for is the WM_QUIT message.  If it is, then we have to break out of the loop that the program is currently in:

                  if(msg.message == WM_QUIT) break;

If a quit message was not processed, we still have to have the other messages processed.  For that we use the TranslateMessage() function to interpret the message.  Then after that we use the DispatchMessage() function to execute the message.  Both functions take as a single parameter a pointer to the MSG structure:

                  TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
                  DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
              }
      }

Those two curly brackets end our main loop.  The last thing we do before we finish up the WinMain() function is return a value to the Operating System.  We return 0 as the value since by this time the program has run successfully:

      return 0;
}

Now compile and run the program, and you should get this nice result:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interesting point, Heres something to think about.

I think all Genetic research of the actively trying to create new
Genes, or new Genetic codes variety should absolutely be haulted
until we actually know the syntax laws of the code flawlessly.

No amount of genetic research in the &quot;lets play with genetics splicing and see what we get variety&quot; can ever really give us those
answers, and, more importantly, there may be genetic instabilities
that arrive by bad splicing; We have no idea which laws of the syntax
we are breaking when we splice.

What we need to do is make a very public super database
(Which is by the way endgame, finished article definition, in the
works if you look at wikimedias other sister project.)
What we need to do is comprehensively catalogue in total exquisite
detail all of the diversity of biology on planet earth, and then use
computer simulations and programming to infer the syntax by cross
comparing the assorted genetic codes to the assorted holomorphic forms.

Until that is done, Genetic toying might have extremely hazardous
results; for instance, ambiguated genetic structures could end up
hopping species, either through accidental apeal by means of the splice intermarriage, or by chaos identification and thus slurpage
for some happy exotic virus.

Genetic tinkering in the current era is sloppy and thus dangerous.
We now have finally built computers with enough processing power,
and we are sharing information in enough of a transparent and thus
geometrically increasing way on the internet;
What is currently known about genetics could probably solve the
mjor genetic problems; the problem is that there are thousands of seperated repositories for that knowledge and theres no way for those
Databases to be linked.

The intellectual labor that was impossible until probably 1995 is now
probably even more feasable now than it was probably around then.
Genetic research of the gambling with random chance, chaos, and fate
style should be suspended immediately, along with stem cell research.
Not because stem Cell research, or Genetic Engineering aren't promising technologies, but because we are fooling ourselves to beleive that we know enough yet to be responsible with those technologies.

Once we know what we are doing, then swing the doors back open....

Anyways, thats a lot for a discussion...lol.</text>

Here we are going to cover how to obtain the Anim8or program and how to run it.

First go to the Anim8or main website at http://www.anim8or.com.  Click on the spinning “Enter” text on the bottom and you will be at the main page.  From the menu at the left, select the “Download” link.  When you get to that page, select the zip file right under the header “Download Anim8or Executable” and download the zip file to a target folder.  Optionally you can go a little bit below that header and download the PDF manual for Anim8or in zip format.  Once you have all the files downloaded, unzip the Anim8or zip file and look in the unzipped folder.  You should only see just one item in the folder called “Anim8or.exe”.  Double-click that to open it.  Congratulations on obtaining and running Anim8or.

      <text xml:space="preserve">From meta-purpose, to universal purpose, to a universal religion: what a train of thought!
-------------
i agree, but self congratulatory remarks might be better suited for a
chat or discussion environment than the actual article itself.
------------

Our meta-purpose remains just an undefined vision of what Life might eventually become. “Supporting Life’s journey to become oB” may well be an emotionally appealing activity worth adopting when considering behavioural alternatives. However, it will not serve as the guiding purpose the world needs to craft legislation of use in international courts of law. For that a well-defined “universal purpose” is needed.
----------------

I think there are a whole host of good motivations and reasons that
could be listed which would have a more compelling nature to me personally.
I haven't honestly followed the whole train through, I'm still
just pulling the most interesting thing i spot and making comment
on it.

I think what we are doing here is making the argument PRO &quot;Universal&quot;
If thats true, then you and I are definitely living in paralell universes, because my POV is &quot;Educated Integrative Eclectic.&quot;

The reasons I think that a &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;Eclectic&quot; Approach should be adopted are;
1. The assorted religions don't operate at the functional level for most Users. Whatever else may be said for Christianity or Islam, The current result of participating is suspiciously similar to a neocortical lobotomy. Why? Because the Religions have invariably been
kidnapped and held hostage by politically motivated propagandists.
Those people invariably want to use information to CONTROL people,
NOT Liberate their minds, or faciliate a Genuine Spiritual Life.

2. In MOST cases, the assorted flaws of any given religious dogma
are forced to resolve when that dogmas core axioms are compared to
similar core axioms in other religions. ie The problems can be flushed out and the entire set of paradigms can be scrubbed clean most easilly by using alternate dirty paradigms as co-scrubbers.

3. This makes the game of doing this lucidly about single paradigm
discussions, with stated up front POV Strubs for all of the denominations likely to register a blip or an opinion one way or the other.

4. Most important in the POV sets are the meta sets. These are.

1. Casual Eclectic; Persons who aren't educated, but can see a pattern with two different religions having two similar core axioms.

2. Educated Lazy Eclectic; Anybody highly educated, but in less than
three paradigms

3. Educated Integral Eclectic; Anybody highly educated whos whole
POV hinges on bringing in as many different details from as many different paradigms as is possible; IE the &quot;Hard Core&quot; Eclectic.
Or, A person highly educated in probably at least two or more
paradigms, and at least slightly educated in at least 3 or more others.

4. Universal; The intuitive approach at a high level of functionality.

5. Macro Axiom; A schematized and ordered list of Axioms (pro POV only) Which then links into the POV per axiom pages.

6. Macro Flaw; Logical fallacies, Propaganda tricks, The Psychology
of being accidentally wrong and evangelical, etc.

7. Historical Footnotes

8. Annoted Integrative Eclectic Bible

9. Annotated Integrative other religious Text

10. Link outs to Ethics, Sociology, Civil Engineering,
Psychonautics Solutions.

-------------------

A universal purpose is also required if a nation-guiding moral code is to be developed. Such a code would provide the moral authority international bodies need if they are to serve humanity well as we move into a very uncertain future.

---------------------
Yeah, let me say some things as a Politico and a Social Scientist
with the equivalent of a doctorate degree in Political Science and
the equivalnet of a Bachelors degree in &quot;War&quot; or &quot;Game&quot; Theory.

We cannot win the war on Terrror. Its a futile venture, because there
will be a country with Islamic Radicals running it which also has Nukes within our Lifetimes. The Clock is ticking for us to solve this problem in a real way, or, End the human species due to pack
psychologies idiot program.

The real solution to the problem is to resolve the social and civil
issues well enough that we can end poverty and strife for everybody
on the planet. Whatever kneejerk responses that may elicit, the truth of the matter is that for the same price as the IRAQ war, we could have fed, sheltered, and clothed Every person on this planet.

In the modern era, it is less costly to turn your enemies into your dependants than it is to bother to fight them.

And only THAT wisdom will deliver us from Armageddon.
------------------


This chapter suggests steps that might be taken to build a universal religion from the yet-to-be-developed universal purpose. Some might consider that a powerfully worded and valued purpose should suffice to guide collective global decision making, but this is not how I contend the mind operates. 
------------------
My opinion, and what I am trying to drive home to you, is that while
your overall concept is a noble and high aspiration, you are making a chronicly naive set of assumptions about how much process is going
to be needed to arrive at an end product rather than an eventually deleted POV and Propaganda experiment.

Global decision making will need to arise from the blueprint that we as Authors set down. For instance,
take the single topic of &quot;Christianity.&quot;

What you need is a few new bullets under that main topic;
*Pro POV
* Con POV
*POV Disambiguation; Please State your Denomination and POV.
* List Of Standard Axioms
* List of Esoteric Axioms
* List of Ethical Errors, and Solutions
* List of Cognitive Errors, and Solutions
* List Of Logical Errors, and Solutions
* List of Social Engineering Errors, and Solutions
*List and Exploration of Derived Gems
* Eclectic Integrative Analysis
*Eclectic Integration

That, in my opinion, could serve as a template for each of the religions.
----------------------
*


As we saw in Part Two, the mental Construct that a belief develops can preclude alternative ways of thinking, thus all true believers of any doctrine will always claim that the commandments of their faith override any national or international law. Something labelled a “universal religion” may come to be regarded as worthy of being equally obeyed. My hope is that some day members of all religions might take the time to consider what was being said, if it were being expressed by a sufficient number of well-respected and influential people all claiming to follow a “universal religion.”
-----------------

The ultimate pay off for this is that it is the ultimate tool for
diplomacy. If there is an axiom map generated between religions, then people of different religions can use their own religious principles to explore similar ideas in other religions. This makes
talking to an Islamic Extremist a whole lot easier, if you have printed out our text to ride along with you in say Palestine.
--------------------
Again, the “universal religion” being proposed here is not something to be force fed to anyone. It should be seen as a companion to other religions, concerned about and dealing with the welfare of community and life, but having nothing to say about any individual after-life beliefs. Eventually, however, I do think that the rationality of the proposed universal religion will lead it to replace the less objective religions that we have inherited, because humankind is itself becoming more rational. Perhaps this transition will occur sometime in the future, however, not in this century, I suspect.
--------------------------
I am more optomistic. THIS that we are doingright now, has tremendous
causal potential, and the potential for geometric progression in terms of participation. We are in the earliest part of THIS century,
so unless you wrote that prior to 2000, I think its very realistic to think that we could create something here which would become the new dominant Religious reference text.

From there, its only a matter of time till the old opinionated non-internet using old foagies start to die off. Evolution and paradigmal
theory have been held at bay as forces by the propaganda establishment; but thats slowly creating a tidal surge in knowlege and information. Sooner or later that Tide has to come in somewhere,
and when its full impact hits, there is going to be rapid paradigmal
evolution, because nobody will be able to take the old paradigms seriously any more.

-------------------------
Elements of this chapter trouble me. Section two seems to be promoting disorder, 
--------------------
You have to break eggs to make omellettes.
-----------------

 there are many who know much more than I 
-----------------
possibly, but I think you are still the best lead Author.
----------------
about promoting a cause in a sensible manner; they would be the ones to consult when action is sought, not me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Large scale problems exist throughout the world. A few words can readily bring some to mind: famine, diseases, polluted water and air, drought, climate change, deforestation, resource depletion, species extinctions, soil loss, wars, genocide, corruption, social and economic disparities—
-----------------------
I would add propaganda wars, Politics drifting off towards Oligarchy,
Social Engineering, and Civil Engineering, to steer towards answers
rather than just complaints.
--------------

once begun the list may run for pages. Lumped all together they are immensely depressing. Many seem irresolvable—how can we even hope to improve such situations?
---------------
*First step; facing the fact that the current paradigm has no
answers. * Second step; analyze the problems realistically, * third
step, generate new schema to describe the realities we face, * fourth
step, generate a problem solving process, * fifth step, implement
that problem solving process.
-------------

It’s not that efforts haven’t been made. 
-----------
No, its that the prevailing dominant paradigms are too primitive to
have real answers to the problems.
The &quot;Establishment&quot; is lost in its groupthink.

We could house them all, for instance, in Southern California,
in about 50 1 mile tall arcologies, each with a 30 mile radius
farming and garden zone.

The problem that some people think population growth is is illusory;
its not too many people, its the net and depth impact on natural
resources per capita that is the issue here.
-----------------

It is the large scale institutions and interventions that seem so often to be ineffectual—neutered during conception,

------------------
The horrible truth; The classists WANT Poverty and strife because
it stratifies society and they gat to have labor bots, wage slaves,
and other folks doing stuff so that decent folks can play golf all day.
Thats the only reason those problems have not been solved. Not that somebody hasn't come up with the social or cultural or economic solutions; &quot;Religion&quot; combined with &quot;conservatism&quot; combined with
herd mentality, group think, and Greed, keep the solutions science
has found from being implemented.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
Acoustics (from Greek ακουστικός pronounced akoustikos meaning &quot;of or for hearing, ready to hear&quot;) is the science that studies sound, in particular its production, transmission, and effects. The science of acoustics has many applications which are dependent upon the nature of the sound that is to be produced, transmitted or controlled. 

In the case of a desirable sound, such as music, the main application of acoustics is to make the music sound as good as possible.  In the case of an undesirable sound, such as traffic noise, the main application of acoustics is in noise reduction. 

Another major area of acoustics is in the field of ultrasound which has applications in detection, such as sonar systems or non-destructive material testing. The articles in this Wikibook describe the fundamentals of acoustics and some of the major applications.

== Introduction ==

Sound is an oscillation of pressure transmitted through a gas, liquid, or solid in the form of a traveling [[w:wave|wave]], and can be generated by any localized pressure variation in a medium. An easy way to understand how sound propagates is to consider that space can be divided into thin layers. The vibration (the successive compression and relaxation) of these layers, at a certain velocity, enables the sound to propagate, hence producing a wave. The speed of sound depends on the compressibility and density of the medium.

In this chapter, we will only consider the propagation of sound waves in an area without any acoustic source, in a [[w:homogeneous|homogeneous]] fluid.

== Equation of waves ==

Sound waves consist in the propagation of a scalar quantity, acoustic over-pressure. The propagation of sound waves in a stationary medium (e.g. still air or water) is governed by the following equation (see [[w:wave equation|wave equation]]): 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 p - \frac{1}{{c_0 ^2 }}\frac{{\partial ^2 p}}{{\partial t^2 }} = 0&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;

This equation is obtained using the conservation equations (mass, momentum and energy) and the thermodynamic equations of state of an ideal gas (or of an ideally compressible solid or liquid), supposing that the pressure variations are small, and neglecting viscosity and thermal conduction, which would give other terms, accounting for sound attenuation.

In the propagation equation of sound waves, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation velocity of the sound wave (which has nothing to do with the vibration velocity of the air layers). This propagation velocity has the following expression:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;c_0  = \frac{1}{{\sqrt {\rho _0 \chi _s } }}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho _0&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;\chi _S&lt;/math&gt; is the compressibility coefficient of the propagation medium.

== Helmholtz equation ==

Since the velocity field &lt;math&gt;\underline v&lt;/math&gt; for acoustic waves is irrotational we can define an acoustic potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi &lt;/math&gt; by: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline v  = \text{grad }\Phi &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Using the propagation equation of the previous paragraph, it is easy to obtain the new equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \Phi  - \frac{1}{{c_0 ^2 }}\frac{{\partial ^2 \Phi }}{{\partial t^2 }} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Applying the Fourier Transform, we get the widely used Helmholtz equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \hat \Phi  + k^2 \hat \Phi  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the wave number associated with &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Using this equation is often the easiest way to solve acoustical problems.

== Acoustic intensity and decibel ==

The acoustic intensity represents the acoustic energy flux associated with the wave propagation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline i (t) = p\underline v 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; 
 	
We can then define the average intensity:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline I  =  &lt; \underline i  &gt; 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 
However, acoustic intensity does not give a good idea of the sound level, since the sensitivity of our ears is logarithmic. Therefore we define decibels, either using acoustic over-pressure or acoustic average intensity:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p^{dB}  = 20\log \left(\frac{p}{{p_\mathrm{ref} }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;  ;  &lt;math&gt;L_I  = 10\log \left(\frac{I}{{I_\mathrm{ref} }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 	 
where &lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{ref}  = 2.10^{ - 5} Pa&lt;/math&gt; for air, or &lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{ref}  = 10^{ - 6} Pa&lt;/math&gt;  for any other media, and &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{ref} = 10^{ - 12}&lt;/math&gt; W/m².

== Solving the wave equation ==

=== Plane waves ===

If we study the propagation of a sound wave, far from the acoustic source, it can be considered as a plane 1D wave. If the direction of propagation is along the x axis, the solution is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi (x,t) = f\left(t - \frac{x}{{c_0 }}\right) + g\left(t + \frac{x}{{c_0 }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 
where f and g can be any function. f describes the wave motion toward increasing x, whereas g describes the motion toward decreasing x.

The momentum equation provides a relation between &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underline v&lt;/math&gt; which leads to the expression of the specific impedance, defined as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{v} = Z =  \pm \rho _0 c_0 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

And still in the case of a plane wave, we get the following expression for the acoustic intensity:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\underline i  =  \pm \frac{{p^2 }}{{\rho _0 c_0 }}\underline {e_x } 
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Spherical waves ===

More generally, the waves propagate in any direction and are spherical waves. In these cases, the solution for the acoustic potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi (r,t) = \frac{1}{r}f\left(t - \frac{r}{{c_0 }}\right) + \frac{1}{r}g\left(t + \frac{r}{{c_0 }}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
 
The fact that the potential decreases linearly while the distance to the source rises is just a consequence of the conservation of energy.
For spherical waves, we can also easily calculate the specific impedance as well as the acoustic intensity.

== Boundary conditions ==

Concerning the boundary conditions which are used for solving the wave equation, we can distinguish two situations. If the medium is not absorptive, the boundary conditions are established using the usual equations for mechanics. But in the situation of an absorptive material, it is simpler to use the concept of acoustic impedance.

=== Non-absorptive material ===

In that case, we get explicit boundary conditions either on stresses and on velocities at the interface. These conditions depend on whether the media are solids, inviscid or viscous fluids.

=== Absorptive material ===

Here, we use the acoustic impedance as the boundary condition. This impedance, which is often given by experimental measurements depends on the material, the fluid and the frequency of the sound wave.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Acoustics RotorStatorInteractions 2.JPG|center]]

An important issue for the aeronautical industry is the reduction of aircraft noise. The characteristics of the turbomachinery noise are to be studied. The rotor/stator interaction is a predominant part of the noise emission.
We will present an introduction to these interaction theory, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction.

== Noise emission of a Rotor-Stator mechanism ==

A Rotor wake induces on the downstream Stator blades a fluctuating vane loading, which is directly linked to the noise emission.

We consider a B blades Rotor (at a rotation speed of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) and a V blades stator, in a unique Rotor/Stator configuration. The source frequencies are multiples of &lt;math&gt;B \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, that is to say &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For the moment we don’t have access to the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. The noise frequencies are also &lt;math&gt;mB \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, not depending on the number of blades of the stator. Nevertheless, this number V has a predominant role in the noise levels (&lt;math&gt;P_{m}&lt;/math&gt;) and directivity, as it will be discussed later.

''Example''

''For an airplane air-conditioning ventilator, reasonable data are :''

''&lt;math&gt;B=13&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 12000&lt;/math&gt; rnd/min''

''The blade passing frequency is 2600 Hz, so we only have to include the first two multiples (2600 Hz and 5200 Hz), because of the human ear high-sensibility limit. We have to study the frequencies m=1 and m=2.''

== Optimization of the number of blades ==

As the source levels can't be easily modified, we have to focus on the interaction between those levels and the noise levels.

The transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; contains the following part :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{s =  - \infty }^{s =  + \infty } {e^{ - {{i(mB - sV)\pi } \over 2}} J_{mB - sV} } (mBM)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where m is the Mach number and &lt;math&gt;J_{mB - sV}&lt;/math&gt; the Bessel function of mB-sV order. In order to minimize the influence of the transfer function, the goal is to reduce the value of this Bessel function. To do so, the argument must be smaller than the order of the Bessel function.

''Back to the example :''

''For m=1, with a Mach number M=0.3, the argument of the Bessel function is about 4. We have to avoid having mB-sV inferior than 4. If V=10, we have 13-1x10=3, so there will be a noisy mode. If V=19, the minimum of mB-sV is 6, and the noise emission will be limited.''

''Remark :''

''The case that is to be strictly avoided is when mB-sV can be nul, which causes the order of the Bessel function to be 0. As a consequence, we have to take care having B and V prime numbers.''

== Determination of source levels ==

The minimization of the transfer function &lt;math&gt;{{F_m } \over {P_m }}&lt;/math&gt; is a great step in the process of reducing the noise emission. Nevertheless, to be highly efficient, we also have to predict the source levels &lt;math&gt;F_{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This will lead us to choose to minimize the Bessel functions for the most significant values of m. For example, if the source level for m=1 is very higher than for m=2, we will not consider the Bessel functions of order 2B-sV.
The determination of the source levels is given by the Sears theory, which will not be discussed here.

== Directivity ==

All this study was made for a specific direction : the axis of the Rotor/Stator. All the results are acceptable when the noise reduction is ought to be in this direction. In the case where the noise to reduce is perpendicular to the axis, the results are very different, as those figures shown :

For B=13 and V=13, which is the worst case, we see that the sound level is very high on the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Acoustics 1313.JPG]]&lt;/center&gt;

For B=13 and V=19, the sound level is very low on the axis but high perpendicularly to the axis (for &lt;math&gt;\theta = Pi/2&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Acoustics 1319.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Kowey's notes ==

I'm using this section to note my thoughts down as I struggle to understand monad transformers.  Perhaps these bits and pieces can then be used to build a tutorial.  Don't pay it any heed.  I'll clean it up as things become clearer to me and share them with the wikibooks community.

Perhaps one useful trick to understanding this is not to think in terms of embedding one monad instead another, but of combining two monads into a third super-monad with functionality from both.

Or another way to look at is that that monad transformers are devious creatures: we talk about them as if we're running a monad inside of another, but what we're &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doing is threading the so-called outer-monad through in so-called inner monad.

* http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html



=== lift (or liftM for monads) ===

Ok, so you use &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; to lift non-monadic functions into a monad.  Similarly, monad transformers are monads which provide a function &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; to lift functions from one monad into another.  So, &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; isn't anything fancy; it's just the same thing as &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; for monads. 

 class MonadTrans t where
  lift :: Monad m =&gt; m a -&gt; t m a

Wait a sec: why is it that all of a sudden, our lift function only takes one argument and not two?

:It looks to me like lift is now lifting ''any'' monadic value, not just functions. Let's see here:

 liftM :: Monad m                 =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
 lift  :: (Monad m, MonadTrans t) =&gt; m a      -&gt; t m a

:I'm not sure how well these unify, but hopefully this answers your question. --[[User:Ihope127|Ihope127]] 17:10, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

::Whoops! Sorry, I didn't mean to leave these old notes lying around.  I think I'm ok with &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; now (see the module page).  If you want to help me understand arrows, though, see [[Talk:Programming:Haskell arrows/Kowey]] :-D -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:27, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Squeee! ==

Nothing serious, but today I figured out how to use the State monad (hurray for me), and I wrote a silly program using a state-monad transformer! I think I'm finally getting this stuff :-)

 bottle :: StateT Int IO Int
 bottle = do
   t &lt;- get
   liftIO $ putStrLn $ show t ++ &quot; bottles of beer on the wall!&quot;
   put (t - 1)
   return (t - 1)
 
 countBottles :: StateT Int IO ()
 countBottles = do
   n &lt;- bottle
   if n == 0 then liftIO $ return () else countBottles
 
 bottles :: Int -&gt; IO ((), Int)
 bottles = runStateT (countBottles)

Thank you, wikibooks folks!

== Instance definitions ==

&lt;pre&gt;
instance (Monad m) =&gt; Monad (Maybe m) where
&lt;/pre&gt;

Shouldn't this rather be:

&lt;pre&gt;
instance Monad Maybe where
&lt;/pre&gt;

Same for List.

--gog (2007-01-18)

:Whoops! I think the correct declaration is &lt;pre&gt;instance Monad (Maybe a) where&lt;/pre&gt; Thanks for pointing this out -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:49, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

::'''Maybe a''' has kind *. A monad must have kind * -&gt; *.  --gog (2007-01-18)

:::You are so right (and you have given me a better grasp what kinds are for).  I got confused glancing down at the instance for State, but of course I forgot that the s in State s refers to the thing we're passing around.  Sorry about that.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:35, 18 January 2007 (UTC)


Shouldn't be

&lt;pre&gt;
case b_v of

&lt;/pre&gt;

instead of

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
? --[[User:Buben.razuma|buben.razuma]] 14:27, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

::I don't think so, because f v already is of type &lt;code&gt;Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 19:10, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

:::: Yes, it is, that's what I mean. The second snippet is what's written and the first one is what should be. --[[User:Buben.razuma|buben.razuma]] 19:16, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

::::: Eep! You're quite right... hmm... maybe worth taking a second look at that MaybeT... Sorry, I wasn't reading carefully enough.  Thought you were talking about the other way around  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:29, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

=== StateT definition ===
I don't see the point of the extra return and (&lt;-) operator in the implementation of the bind operator of StateT:
&lt;pre&gt;
(StateT x) &gt;&gt;= f =
 StateT $ \s -&gt; do -- get new value, state
 (v,s') &lt;- x s
 -- apply bound function to get new state transformation fn
 (StateT x') &lt;- return $ f v
 -- apply the state transformation fn to the new state
 x' s'
&lt;/pre&gt;
Couldn't we use let instead?:
&lt;pre&gt;
(StateT x) &gt;&gt;= f =
 StateT $ \s -&gt; do -- get new value, state
 (v,s') &lt;- x s
 -- apply bound function to get new state transformation fn
 let (StateT x') = f v
 -- apply the state transformation fn to the new state
 x' s'
&lt;/pre&gt;
-- [[User:Auders|Auders]] ([[User talk:Auders|talk]]) 20:28, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:Yes, the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is bad style here. Changed to &lt;code&gt;runStateT&lt;/code&gt; to mimic the use of &lt;code&gt;runState&lt;/code&gt;.-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 10:16, 29 June 2008 (UTC)

# Could a motivating example be put near the beginning of this article, e.g. something that shows exactly why you would use a transformer and how you'd use it to combine actions from two different monads.
# The table of transformers in the &quot;cousins&quot; section should include a row for MaybeT since MaybeT is explained in detail further down.  MaybeT is probably a good candidate for the motivating example above as well, since Maybe is such a simple monad.  So you'd have an example of using MaybeT near the top, then go on to the implementation explanation further down.  Any other transformers mentioned in the article should also be put in the table, if they're not already there.
# I'm a bit fuzzy about this but &quot;The type constructor Reader r is an instance of the Monad class&quot; looks a little odd to me; I thought that types (not type constructors) were instances of type classes.  Am I missing something?  If there's a distinction, is it just a pedantic one?  
:Thanks.

:# Yes. The chapters about monads are currently undergoing a rewrite, starting with [[Haskell/Understanding monads]]. So, this chapter will be rewritten too and get motivation, but I can't say when :-)  
:# Yes. Someone please do so.
:# Type constructors (i.e. things of kind &lt;code&gt;* -&gt; *&lt;/code&gt;) can indeed be instances of classes two. In fact, this feature was added to Haskell exactly to make the monad class possible. So, the the constructor &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; is the monad, not the &quot;concrete&quot; type &lt;code&gt;Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; (of kind &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). [[Haskell/Understanding monads]] already contains a bit of info on this.

: I'm not sure I want to be tinkering with the article text, but here's a motivating example I emailed a friend once. I think it's right. It may be of some use:

:: Concrete example: Suppose I was writing a server. Each client thread must be of type IO () (that's because forkIO :: IO () -&gt; IO ThreadID)).

:: Suppose also that this server has some configuration that (in an imperative program) would be global that the clients all need to query.

:: &gt; data Config = Config Foo Bar Baz

:: One way of doing this is to use currying and making all the client threads of type Config -&gt; IO (). Not too nice because any functions they call have to be passed the Config parameter manually. The Reader monad solves this problem but we've already got one monad. We need to wrap IO in a ReaderT. The type constructor for ReaderT is ReaderT r m a, with r the shared environment to read from, m the inner monad and a the return type. Our client_func becomes:

:: &gt; client_func :: ReaderT Config IO ()

:: We can then use the ask, asks and local functions as if Reader was the only Monad:

:: (these examples are inside do blocks)

:: &gt; p &lt;- asks port

:: (Assuming some function port :: Config -&gt; Int or similar.)

:: To do stuff in IO (or in the general case any inner monad) the liftIO function is used to make an IO function work in this wrapped space:

:: (given h :: Handle, the client's handle)

:: &gt; liftIO $ hPutStrLn h &quot;You lose&quot;
:: &gt; liftIO $ hFlush h

:: IO is once again special. For other inner monads, the lift function does the same thing. Note also that IO has no transformer and must therefore always be the innermost monad.

:: This is all well and good, but the client_func now has type ReaderT Config IO () and forkIO needs a function of type IO (). The escape function for Reader is runReader :: Reader r a -&gt; r -&gt; a and similarly for ReaderT the escape function is runReaderT :: ReaderT r m a -&gt; r -&gt; m a:

:: (Given some c :: Config that's been assembled from config files or the like)

:: &gt; forkIO (runReaderT client_func c)

:: Will do the trick.

:: Monad transformers are like onions. They make you cry but you learn to appreciate them. Like onions, they're also made of layers. Each layer is the functionality of a new monad, you lift monadic functions to get into the inner monads and you have transformerised functions to unwrap each layer. They're also like a present in that regard: in this example we unwrapped the outer wrapping paper to get to the present: an object of type IO (), which let us make haskell do something.

== Dead links. ==

Please fix up the ghc documentation links. Thanks for the great tutorial.

== 2012-05-06 reorganization ==

I have just performed a major reorganization in the article. The getPassword example, which introduces transformers though MaybeT, was made slightly more detailed to work better as an introduction. The corresponding section about MaybeT further in the page was removed, along with most references to the sandwich analogy (though I left a body note about it near the beginning). The dissection of ListT was grouped at the end with the StateT discussion; the lift section now precedes it. The older introduction is mostly gone, with only the All About Monads derived part (the one with the table) remaining, and even that was completely reworked to fit the surrounding context (a later addition to it, which tried to generalize the non-generalizable was summarily removed). Hopefully you will find the text much more readable now. There are still improvements to be made - IMO, the key one is adding better practical exercises (I have a few ideas about that) and providing solutions to the existing ones. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 13:22, 6 May 2012 (UTC)

== 2015-09-11 cleanup ==

A general cleanup of the sections after the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; introduction was performed, with the main goal of clarifying some confusing passages and shifting the focus of some others. Solutions to the exercises were added as well. Remaining concerns include:

* The &lt;code&gt;ListT&lt;/code&gt; discussion was mercilessly removed, mostly to avoid facing the infamous &quot;ListT done wrong&quot; issue (that is, the fact that the &lt;code&gt;ListT&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;transformers&lt;/tt&gt; violates the monad laws when used with non-commutative base monads).
* Calling the non-transformer &quot;cousin&quot; of a monad transformer &quot;base monad&quot; is unfortunate, as &quot;base monad&quot; usually refers to what this chapter calls &quot;inner monad&quot;.
* The password example should probably include a runnable full-program demonstration.

[https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell/Monad_transformers&amp;oldid=2981590 This is the latest revision before the cleanup].

We have seen how monads can help handling &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; actions, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, lists, and state.
With monads providing a common way to use such useful general-purpose tools, a natural thing we might want to do is using the capabilities of ''several'' monads at once. For instance, a function could use both I/O and &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; exception handling. While a type like &lt;code&gt;IO (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt; would work just fine, it would force us to do pattern matching within &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; do-blocks to extract values, something that the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad was meant to spare us from.

Enter '''monad transformers''': special types that allow us to roll two monads into a single one that shares the behavior of both.

== Passphrase validation ==

Consider a real-life problem for IT staff worldwide: getting users to create strong passphrases.
One approach: force the user to enter a minimum length with various irritating requirements (such as at least one capital letter, one number, one non-alphanumeric character, etc.)

Here's a Haskell function to acquire a passphrase from a user:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getPassphrase :: IO (Maybe String)
getPassphrase = do s &lt;- getLine
                   if isValid s then return $ Just s
                                else return Nothing

-- The validation test could be anything we want it to be.
isValid :: String -&gt; Bool
isValid s = length s &gt;= 8
            &amp;&amp; any isAlpha s
            &amp;&amp; any isNumber s
            &amp;&amp; any isPunctuation s
&lt;/source&gt;

First and foremost, &lt;code&gt;getPassphrase&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; action, as it needs to get input from the user. We also use &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, as we intend to return &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; in case the password does not pass the &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt;. Note, however, that we aren't actually using &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; as a monad here: the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block is in the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, and we just happen to &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; value into it.

Monad transformers not only make it easier to write &lt;code&gt;getPassphrase&lt;/code&gt; but also simplify all the code instances. Our passphrase acquisition program could continue like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
askPassphrase :: IO ()
askPassphrase = do putStrLn &quot;Insert your new passphrase:&quot;
                   maybe_value &lt;- getPassphrase
                   if isJust maybe_value
                     then do putStrLn &quot;Storing in database...&quot; -- do stuff
                     else putStrLn &quot;Passphrase invalid.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
The code uses one line to generate the &lt;code&gt;maybe_value&lt;/code&gt; variable followed by further validation of the passphrase.

With monad transformers, we will be able to extract the passphrase in one go — without any pattern matching or equivalent bureaucracy like &lt;code&gt;isJust&lt;/code&gt;. The gains for our simple example might seem small but will scale up for more complex situations.

== A simple monad transformer: &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; ==

To simplify &lt;code&gt;getPassphrase&lt;/code&gt; and all the code that uses it, we will define a ''monad transformer'' that gives the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad some characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad; we will call it &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;. That follows a convention where monad transformers have a &quot;&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;&quot; appended to the name of the monad whose characteristics they provide.

&lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper around &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; can be any monad (&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in our example):
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype MaybeT m a = MaybeT { runMaybeT :: m (Maybe a) }
&lt;/source&gt;
This data type definition specifies a &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; type constructor, parameterized over &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, with a term constructor, also called &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, and a convenient accessor function &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, with which we can access the underlying representation.

The whole point of monad transformers is that ''they are monads themselves''; and so we need to make &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt; an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad m =&gt; Monad (MaybeT m) where
    return  = MaybeT . return . Just
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!-- there had been here a horribly written run-on sentence trying to explain the code above, but I couldn't make parse it nor figure out how to write a better replacement. Better to just let the code stand on its own. If someone else can write a new explanation, maybe that will be good. --&gt;
It would also have been possible (though arguably less readable) to write &lt;code&gt;return  = MaybeT . return . return&lt;/code&gt;.

As in all monads, the bind operator is the heart of the transformer.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- The signature of (&gt;&gt;=), specialized to MaybeT m
(&gt;&gt;=) :: MaybeT m a -&gt; (a -&gt; MaybeT m b) -&gt; MaybeT m b

x &gt;&gt;= f = MaybeT $ do maybe_value &lt;- runMaybeT x
                      case maybe_value of
                           Nothing    -&gt; return Nothing
                           Just value -&gt; runMaybeT $ f value
&lt;/source&gt;

Starting from the first line of the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block:
* First, the &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; accessor unwraps &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt; computation. That shows us that the whole &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block is in &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;.
* Still in the first line, &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; extracts a &lt;code&gt;Maybe a&lt;/code&gt; value from the unwrapped computation.
* The &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement tests &lt;code&gt;maybe_value&lt;/code&gt;:
** With &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, we return &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;;
** With &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;, we apply &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; from the Just. Since &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m b&lt;/code&gt; as result type, we need an extra &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; to put the result back into the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; monad.
* Finally, the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block as a whole has &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe b)&lt;/code&gt; type; so it is wrapped with the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; constructor. 
It may look a bit complicated; but aside from the copious amounts of wrapping and unwrapping, the implementation does the same as the familiar bind operator of &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;:  

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- (&gt;&gt;=) for the Maybe monad
maybe_value &gt;&gt;= f = case maybe_value of
                        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                        Just value -&gt; f value
&lt;/source&gt;

Why use the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; constructor before the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block while we have the accessor &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;? Well, the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block must be in the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; monad, not in &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt; (which lacks a defined bind operator at this point).

{{body note|The chained functions in the definition of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; suggest a metaphor, which you may find either useful or confusing. Consider the combined monad as a ''sandwich''. This metaphor might suggest three layers of monads in action, but there are only two really: the inner monad and the combined monad (there are no binds or returns done in the base monad; it only appears as part of the implementation of the transformer). If you like this metaphor at all, think of the transformer and the base monad as two parts of the same thing - the ''bread'' - which wraps the inner monad.}}

Technically, this is all we need; however, it is convenient to make &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; an instance of a few other classes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad m =&gt; MonadPlus (MaybeT m) where
    mzero     = MaybeT $ return Nothing
    mplus x y = MaybeT $ do maybe_value &lt;- runMaybeT x
                            case maybe_value of
                                 Nothing    -&gt; runMaybeT y
                                 Just _     -&gt; return maybe_value

instance MonadTrans MaybeT where
    lift = MaybeT . (liftM Just)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt; implements the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function, so we can take functions from the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; monad and bring them into the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT m&lt;/code&gt; monad in order to use them in &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; blocks. As for &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of that class it makes sense to make the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; an instance too.

=== Application to the passphrase example ===

With all this done, here is what the previous example of passphrase management looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getValidPassphrase :: MaybeT IO String
getValidPassphrase = do s &lt;- lift getLine
                        guard (isValid s) -- MonadPlus provides guard.
                        return s

askPassphrase :: MaybeT IO ()
askPassphrase = do lift $ putStrLn &quot;Insert your new passphrase:&quot;
                   value &lt;- getValidPassphrase
                   lift $ putStrLn &quot;Storing in database...&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
The code is now simpler, especially in the user function &lt;code&gt;askPassphrase&lt;/code&gt;. Most importantly, we do not have to manually check whether the result is &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;: the bind operator takes care of that for us.

Note how we use &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; to bring the functions &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT IO&lt;/code&gt; monad. Also, since &lt;code&gt;MaybeT IO&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;, checking for passphrase validity can be taken care of by a &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt; statement, which will return &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;IO Nothing&lt;/code&gt;) in case of a bad passphrase.

Incidentally, with the help of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; it also becomes very easy to ask the user ''ad infinitum'' for a valid passphrase:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
askPassword :: MaybeT IO ()
askPassword = do lift $ putStrLn &quot;Insert your new password:&quot;
                 value &lt;- msum $ repeat getValidPassphrase
                 lift $ putStrLn &quot;Storing in database...&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== A plethora of transformers ==

The &lt;tt&gt;transformers&lt;/tt&gt; package provides modules with transformers for many common monads (&lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, can be found in {{Haskell lib|p=transformers|v=latest|Control|Monad|Trans|Maybe}}). These are defined consistently with their non-transformer versions; that is, the implementation is basically the same except with the extra wrapping and unwrapping needed to thread the other monad. From this point on, we will use '''base monad''' to refer to the non-transformer monad (e.g. Maybe in MaybeT) on which a transformer is based and '''inner monad''' to refer to the other monad (e.g. IO in MaybeT IO) on which the transformer is applied. 

To pick an arbitrary example, &lt;code&gt;ReaderT Env IO String&lt;code&gt; is a computation which involves reading values from some environment of type &lt;code&gt;Env&lt;/code&gt; (the semantics of &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt;, the base monad) and performing some &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in order to give a value of type &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. Since the bind operator and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; for the transformer mirror the semantics of the base monad, a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block of type &lt;code&gt;ReaderT Env IO String&lt;/code&gt; will, from the outside, look a lot like a &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; block of the &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; monad, except that &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; actions become trivial to embed by using &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Type juggling ===

We have seen that the type constructor for &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper for a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; value in the inner monad. So, the corresponding accessor &lt;code&gt;runMaybeT&lt;/code&gt; gives us a value of type &lt;code&gt;m&amp;nbsp;(Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt; - i.e. a value of the base monad returned in the inner monad. Similarly, for the &lt;code&gt;ListT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ExceptT&lt;/code&gt; transformers, which are built around lists and &lt;code&gt;Either&lt;/code&gt; respectively:
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runListT :: ListT m a -&gt; m [a]
&lt;/source&gt;
and
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
runExceptT :: ExceptT e m a -&gt; m (Either e a)
&lt;/source&gt;

Not all transformers are related to their base monads in this way, however. Unlike the base monads in the two examples above, the &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; monads have neither multiple constructors nor constructors with multiple arguments. For that reason, they have &lt;tt&gt;run...&lt;/tt&gt; functions which act as simple unwrappers, analogous to the &lt;tt&gt;run...T&lt;/tt&gt; of the transformer versions. The table below shows the result types of the &lt;tt&gt;run...&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;run...T&lt;/tt&gt; functions in each case, which may be thought of as the types wrapped by the base and transformed monads respectively.&lt;ref&gt;The wrapping interpretation is only literally true for versions of the &lt;tt&gt;mtl&lt;/tt&gt; package older than 2.0.0.0 .&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Notice that the base monad is absent in the combined types. Without interesting constructors (of the sort for &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; or lists), there is no reason to retain the base monad type after unwrapping the transformed monad. It is also worth noting that in the latter three cases we have function types being wrapped. &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt;, for instance, turns state-transforming functions of the form &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; (a, s)&lt;/code&gt; into state-transforming functions of the form &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; m (a, s)&lt;/code&gt;; only the result type of the wrapped function goes into the inner monad. &lt;code&gt;ReaderT&lt;/code&gt; is analogous.&lt;code&gt;ContT&lt;/code&gt; is different because of the semantics of &lt;code&gt;Cont&lt;/code&gt; (the ''continuation'' monad): the result types of both the wrapped function and its function argument must be the same, and so the transformer puts both into the inner monad. In general, there is no magic formula to create a transformer version of a monad; the form of each transformer depends on what makes sense in the context of its non-transformer type.

== Lifting ==

We will now have a more detailed look at the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function, which is critical in day-to-day use of monad transformers. The first thing to clarify is the name &quot;lift&quot;. One function with a similar name that we already know is &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt;. As we have seen in [[Haskell/Understanding monads#Is my Monad a Functor?|Understanding monads]], it is a monad-specific version of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
liftM :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; applies a function &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; b)&lt;/code&gt; to a value within a monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;. We can also look at it as a function of just one argument:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
liftM :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (m a -&gt; m b)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; converts a plain function into one that acts within &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;. By &quot;lifting&quot;, we refer to bringing something into something else — in this case, a function into a monad. 

&lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; allows us to apply a plain function to a monadic value without needing do-blocks or other such tricks:

{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
!|do notation
!|liftM
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
do x &lt;- monadicValue
   return (f x)
&lt;/source&gt;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
liftM f monadicValue
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function plays an analogous role when working with monad transformers. It brings (or, to use another common word for that, ''promotes'') inner monad computations to the combined monad. By doing so, it allows us to easily insert inner monad computations as part of a larger computation in the combined monad.  

&lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; is the single method of the &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt; class, found in {{Haskell lib|p=transformers|v=latest|Control|Monad|Trans|Class}}. All monad transformers are instances of &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt;, and so &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; is available for them all.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class MonadTrans t where
    lift :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; t m a
&lt;/source&gt;

There is a variant of &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; specific to &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; operations, called &lt;code&gt;liftIO&lt;/code&gt;, which is the single method of the &lt;code&gt;MonadIO&lt;/code&gt; class in {{Haskell lib|p=transformers|v=latest|Control|Monad|IO|Class}}.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class (Monad m) =&gt; MonadIO m where
   liftIO :: IO a -&gt; m a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;liftIO&lt;/code&gt; can be convenient when multiple transformers are stacked into a single combined monad. In such cases, &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is always the innermost monad, and so we typically need more than one lift to bring &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; values to the top of the stack. &lt;code&gt;liftIO&lt;/code&gt; is defined for the instances in a way that allows us to bring an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; value from any depth while writing the function a single time.

=== Implementing &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; ===

Implementing &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; is usually pretty straightforward. Consider the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; transformer:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance MonadTrans MaybeT where
    lift m = MaybeT (liftM Just m)
&lt;/source&gt;

We begin with a monadic value of the inner monad. With &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; would have worked just as fine), we slip the base monad (through the &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt; constructor) underneath, so that we go from &lt;code&gt;m a&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;m (Maybe a)&lt;/code&gt;). Finally, we use the &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; constructor to wrap up the monadic sandwich. Note that the &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; here works in the inner monad, just like the do-block wrapped by &lt;code&gt;MaybeT&lt;/code&gt; in the implementation of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; we saw early on was in the inner monad. 

{{Exercises|1=
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it that the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function has to be defined separately for each monad, where as &lt;code&gt;liftM&lt;/code&gt; can be defined in a universal way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Identity&lt;/code&gt; is a trivial functor, defined in &lt;code&gt;Data.Functor.Identity&lt;/code&gt; as:&lt;pre&gt;newtype Identity a = Identity { runIdentity :: a }&lt;/pre&gt;It has the following &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance:
&lt;pre&gt;
instance Monad Identity where
    return a = Identity a
    m &gt;&gt;= k  = k (runIdentity m)
&lt;/pre&gt;Implement a monad transformer &lt;code&gt;IdentityT&lt;/code&gt;, analogous to &lt;code&gt;Identity&lt;/code&gt; but wrapping values of type &lt;code&gt;m a&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Write at least its &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt; instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
}}

== Implementing transformers ==

===The State transformer===

As an additional example, we will now have a detailed look at the implementation of &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt;. You might want to review the section on the [[Haskell/Understanding monads/State|State monad]] before continuing.

Just as the State monad might have been built upon the definition &lt;code&gt;newtype State s a = State { runState :: (s -&gt; (a,s)) }&lt;/code&gt;, the StateT transformer is built upon the definition:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype StateT s m a = StateT { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (a,s)) }&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;m&lt;/code&gt; will have the following &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; instance, here shown alongside the one for the base state monad: 

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!|State
!|StateT
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
||&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype State s a =
  State { runState :: (s -&gt; (a,s)) }

instance Monad (State s) where
  return a        = State $ \s -&gt; (a,s)
  (State x) &gt;&gt;= f = State $ \s -&gt;
    let (v,s') = x s
    in runState (f v) s'
&lt;/source&gt;
||&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype StateT s m a =
  StateT { runStateT :: (s -&gt; m (a,s)) }

instance (Monad m) =&gt; Monad (StateT s m) where
  return a         = StateT $ \s -&gt; return (a,s)
  (StateT x) &gt;&gt;= f = StateT $ \s -&gt; do
    (v,s') &lt;- x s          -- get new value and state
    runStateT (f v) s'     -- pass them to f
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Our definition of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; makes use of the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function of the inner monad. &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; uses a do-block to perform a computation in the inner monad.

{{body note|1=
Incidentally, we can now finally explain why, [[Haskell/Understanding monads/State#Where did the State constructor go?|back in the chapter about &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;]], there was a &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; function instead of a &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; constructor. In the &lt;tt&gt;transformers&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;mtl&lt;/tt&gt; packages, &lt;code&gt;State s&lt;/code&gt; is implemented as a type synonym for &lt;code&gt;StateT s Identity&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;Identity&lt;/code&gt; being the dummy monad introduced in an exercise of the previous section. The resulting monad is equivalent to the one defined using &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; that we have used up to now.
}}

If the combined monads &lt;code&gt;StateT s m&lt;/code&gt; are to be used as state monads, we will certainly want the all-important &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; operations. Here, we will show definitions in the style of the &lt;tt&gt;mtl&lt;/code&gt; package. In addition to the monad transformers themselves, &lt;tt&gt;mtl&lt;/tt&gt; provides type classes for the essential operations of common monads. For instance, the &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; class, found in {{Haskell lib|p=mtl|v=latest|Control|Monad|State}}, has &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; as methods: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance (Monad m) =&gt; MonadState s (StateT s m) where
  get   = StateT $ \s -&gt; return (s,s)
  put s = StateT $ \_ -&gt; return ((),s)
&lt;/source&gt;

{{body note|1=
&lt;code&gt;instance (Monad m) =&gt; MonadState s (StateT s m)&lt;/code&gt; should be read as: &quot;For any type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; and any instance of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StateT s m&lt;/code&gt; together form an instance of &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; correspond to the state and the inner monad, respectively. &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is an independent part of the instance specification so that the methods can refer to it − for instance, the type of &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;s -&gt; StateT s m ()&lt;/code&gt;. 
}} 

There are &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; instances for state monads wrapped by other transformers, such as &lt;code&gt;MonadState s m =&gt; MonadState s (MaybeT m)&lt;/code&gt;. They bring us extra convenience by making it unnecessary to lift uses of &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; explicitly, as the &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; instance for the combined monads handles the lifting for us. 

It can also be useful to lift instances that might be available for the inner monad to the combined monad. For instance, all combined monads in which &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; is used with an instance of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt; can be made instances of &lt;code&gt;MonadPlus&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance (MonadPlus m) =&gt; MonadPlus (StateT s m) where
  mzero = StateT $ \_ -&gt; mzero
  (StateT x1) `mplus` (StateT x2) = StateT $ \s -&gt; (x1 s) `mplus` (x2 s)
&lt;/source&gt;

The implementations of &lt;code&gt;mzero&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mplus&lt;/code&gt; do the obvious thing; that is, delegating the actual work to the instance of the inner monad.

Lest we forget, the monad transformer must have a &lt;code&gt;MonadTrans&lt;/code&gt;, so that we can use &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance MonadTrans (StateT s) where
  lift c = StateT $ \s -&gt; c &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return (x,s))
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function creates a &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; state transformation function that binds the computation in the inner monad to a function that packages the result with the input state. If, for instance, we apply StateT to the List monad, a function that returns a list (i.e., a computation in the List monad) can be lifted
into &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;[]&lt;/code&gt; where it becomes a function that returns a &lt;code&gt;StateT&amp;nbsp;(s&amp;nbsp;-&gt;&amp;nbsp;[(a,s)])&lt;/code&gt;. I.e. the lifted computation produces ''multiple'' (value,state) pairs from its input state. This &quot;forks&quot; the computation in StateT, creating a different branch of the computation for each value in the list returned by the lifted function. Of course, applying &lt;code&gt;StateT&lt;/code&gt; to a different monad will produce different semantics for the &lt;code&gt;lift&lt;/code&gt; function.

{{Exercises|1=
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;code&gt;state :: MonadState s m =&gt; (s -&gt; (a, s)) -&gt; m a&lt;/code&gt; in terms of &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are &lt;code&gt;MaybeT (State s)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StateT s Maybe&lt;/code&gt; equivalent? (Hint: one approach is comparing what the &lt;code&gt;run...T&lt;/code&gt; unwrappers produce in each case.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The '''speed of sound''' ''c'' (from Latin ''celeritas'', &quot;velocity&quot;) varies depending on the medium through which the sound waves pass. It is usually quoted in describing properties of substances (e.g. see the article on sodium). In conventional use and in scientific literature sound velocity ''v'' is the same as sound speed ''c''. Sound velocity ''c'' or velocity of sound should not be confused with sound particle velocity ''v'', which is the velocity of the individual particles.

More commonly the term refers to the speed of sound in air. The speed varies depending on atmospheric conditions; the most important factor is the temperature. The humidity has very little effect on the speed of sound, while the static sound pressure (air pressure) has none. Sound travels slower with an increased altitude (elevation if you are on solid earth), primarily as a result of temperature and humidity changes. An approximate speed (in metres per second) can be calculated from: 
:&lt;math&gt;
c_{\mathrm{air}} = (331{.}5 + (0{.}6 \cdot \theta)) \ \mathrm{m/s}\, 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta\, &lt;/math&gt; (theta) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

== Details ==

A more accurate expression for the speed of sound is 
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {\kappa \cdot R\cdot T} 
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
* ''R'' (287.05 J/(kg·K) for air) is the gas constant for air: the universal gas constant &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which units of J/(mol·K), is divided by the molar mass of air, as is common practice in aerodynamics)
*&amp;kappa; (kappa) is the adiabatic index (1.402 for air), sometimes noted ''&amp;gamma;''
* ''T'' is the absolute temperature in kelvins. 

In the standard atmosphere :

''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 273.15 K (= 0&amp;#160;°C = 32&amp;#160;°F), giving a value of 331.5 m/s (= 1087.6 ft/s = 1193 km/h = 741.5 mph = 643.9 knots).&lt;br&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; is 293.15 K (= 20&amp;#160;°C = 68&amp;#160;°F), giving a value of 343.4 m/s (= 1126.6 ft/s = 1236 km/h = 768.2 mph = 667.1 knots).&lt;br&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; is 298.15 K (= 25&amp;#160;°C = 77&amp;#160;°F), giving a value of 346.3 m/s (= 1136.2 ft/s = 1246 km/h = 774.7 mph = 672.7 knots).

In fact, assuming an ideal gas, the speed of sound ''c'' depends on temperature only, '''not on the pressure'''. Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere - ''actual conditions may vary''. Any qualification of the speed of sound being &quot;at sea level&quot; is also irrelevant. Speed of sound varies with altitude (height) only because of the changing temperature!

In a '''Non-Dispersive Medium''' &amp;#8211; Sound speed is independent of frequency, therefore the speed of energy transport and sound propagation are the same. For audio sound range air is a non-dispersive medium. We should also note that air contains CO2 which is a dispersive medium and it introduces dispersion to air at ultrasound frequencies (28kHz).&lt;br&gt;
In a '''Dispersive Medium''' &amp;#8211; Sound speed is a function of frequency. The spatial and temporal distribution of a propagating disturbance will continually change. Each frequency component
propagates at each its own phase speed, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the
group velocity. Water is an example of a dispersive medium.

In general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt{\frac{C}{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:''C'' is a coefficient of stiffness
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density

Thus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness of the material, and decreases with the density.

In a fluid the only non-zero stiffness is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces). 

Hence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {\frac{K}{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''K'' is the adiabatic bulk modulus 

For a gas, ''K'' is approximately given by
:&lt;math&gt;
K=\kappa \cdot p
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&amp;kappa; is the adiabatic index, sometimes called &amp;gamma;.
:''p'' is the pressure.

Thus, for a gas the speed of sound can be  calculated using:
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {{\kappa \cdot p}\over\rho}
&lt;/math&gt;
which using the ideal gas law is identical to: 

&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt {\kappa \cdot R\cdot T} 
&lt;/math&gt;

(Newton famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of thermodynamics and so incorrectly used isothermal calculations instead of adiabatic.  His result was missing the factor of &amp;kappa; but was otherwise correct.)

In a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric and shear deformations. Hence, in a solid it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent on the deformation mode.

In a solid rod (with thickness much smaller than the wavelength) the speed of sound is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
c = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:''E'' is Young's modulus
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (rho) is density

Thus in steel the speed of sound is approximately 5100 m/s.&lt;br&gt;

In a solid with lateral dimensions much larger than the wavelength, the sound velocity is higher. It is found by replacing Young's modulus with the plane wave modulus, which can be expressed in terms of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio as:
:&lt;math&gt;
M = E \frac{1-\nu}{1-\nu-2\nu^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

For air, see density of air. 

The speed of sound in water is of interest to those mapping the ocean floor. In saltwater, sound travels at about 1500 m/s and in freshwater 1435 m/s.  These speeds vary due to pressure, depth, temperature, salinity and other factors.

For general equations of state, if classical mechanics is used, the speed of sound &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
c^2=\frac{\partial p}{\partial\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where differentiation is taken with respect to adiabatic change. 

If relativistic effects are important, the speed of sound &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
S^2=c^2 \left. \frac{\partial p}{\partial e} \right|_{\rm adiabatic}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that &lt;math&gt; e= \rho (c^2+e^C) \,&lt;/math&gt; is the relativisic internal energy density).  

This formula differs from the classical case in that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; has been replaced by &lt;math&gt;e/c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Mach number''' is the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of sound in air (medium).

== Sound in solids ==

In solids, the velocity of sound depends on ''density'' of the material, not its temperature.  Solid materials, such as steel, conduct sound much faster than air.

== Experimental methods ==

In air a range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound. 

=== Single-shot timing methods ===

The simplest concept is the measurement made using two microphones and a fast recording device such as a digital storage scope. This method uses the following idea.

If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:

# The distance between the microphones (x)
# The time delay between the signal reaching the different microphones (t)

Then v = x/t

An older method is to create a sound at one end of a field with an object that can be seen to move when it creates the sound. When the observer sees the sound-creating device act they start a stopwatch and when the observer hears the sound they stop their stopwatch. Again using v = x/t you can calculate the speed of sound. A separation of at least 200 m between the two experimental parties is required for good results with this method.

=== Other methods ===

In these methods the time measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time (frequency).

Kundt's tube is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume, it has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the nodes and antinodes visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.

A tuning fork can be held near the mouth of a long pipe which is dipping into a barrel of water, in this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ( {1+2n}/λ ) where n is an integer. As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.

Here it is the case that v = fλ

      <text xml:space="preserve">17 jewels is a magic number for a jeweled watch--That is the minimum number needed to jewel all the critical parts on a time-only watch.  Any fewer jewels on a detached lever watch is a budgetary compromise.  Note:  in horology, the terms lever and pallet are interchangeable.

 Jewel Definitions:  

A pivot jewel has a hole in the center.  The pivot from a staff will use that hole as a bearing. 

A cap jewel (also known as an endstone) covers the end of a pivot, helps hold oil in place.  When properly done, will slightly improve performance.  

The impulse jewel is the main part of the balance assembly that the pallet fork contacts. 

Pallet jewels are somewhat rectangular with angled surfaces, the parts of the pallet that touch the escape wheel. 

 The standard jewels, in order of usefulness

Balance wheel pivot jewels  (2) 
Balance wheel cap jewels  (2) (4)
Balance wheel impulse jewel  (1) (5)
Pallet jewels  (2)  (7)

This would be the logical arrangement for a 7 jewel movement. 

pallet pivot jewels (2)  (9)
Escape wheel pivot jewels (2)  (11)
4th wheel pivot jewels (2)  (13)
third wheel pivot jewels (2)  (15)

Some 15 jewel watches will include all of these jewels, while others will include the center wheel jewels but use a pin-lever mechanism in place of the jeweled lever.  

Center wheel pivot jewels (2)  The final necessary jewels.  


 Other places for jewels

Additionally, pairs of cap jewels can be added to the pivots of the fork, escape, fourth and third wheels, in order of usefulness.  Cap jewels on the fork are useful but fairly difficult, while cap jewels on the train are fairly easy.  

Complications can legitimately use jewels--Chronographs and auto-wind systems are two common uses of jewels 

The mainspring arbor may also be jeweled. This is a marginal use of jewels. 
 
 Marketing jewels  [[Image:BudgetWatchJeweledPinlever950.jpg|right|thumb|Pinlever movement with extra cap jewels--Also note the fake balance wheel screws]]

Many watches have jewels added that do not materially improve the watch, but appeal to the &quot;more jewels is better&quot; belief.   In some cases, a 15 jewel pinlever movement will have an extra set of cap jewels added to get to the magic 17.  Timex made a very odd 21 jewel watch, based on their zero-jewel pinlever designs.  In these, the balance had no cap or pivot jewels, but most of the train had cap jewels of marginal value, in addition to somewhat useful pivot jewels.   Waltham made a 75 and 100 jewel watch with a standard 17 jewel movement enhanced by the addition of jewels around the rim of the watch theoretically to prevent the rotor from wearing the movement if it was impacted.  see [[http://www.timezone.com/library/workbench/workbench0025 this article on Timezone.com]] for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Overview:  

The crown (of a manual wind) or the rotor (of an auto wind) rotates, turning gears in the keyless works which in turn rotate  the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring.  The mainspring turns the mainspring barrel, which turns the train, which supplies power to the escapement, which slows the train down to a precicesly regulated speed.  

 The Keyless works

In the winding position, turning the crown turns the winding pinion. Clockwise (as viewed from the crown) the winding pinion will turn the clutch wheel, which will turn an intermediate wheel and then a gear attached to the mainspring arbor.  Counterclockwise, the winding pinion and clutch wheel have ramped teeth that will disengage.  

In the setting position, the winding pinion moves away from the clutch wheel and towards the center of the watch where it engages an intermediate wheel that in turn engages the minute wheel.  

 The Train

The train consists of the center wheel, which turns at one revolution per hour.  The center wheel drives the third wheel and also the motion works.  The third wheel drives the fourth wheel usually at 1 revolution per minute.  In direct seconds watches, the fourth wheel directly drives the seconds hand.  

 The Motion Works
The cannon pinion is attached with a friction fit to the center wheel.  It drives thhe minute wheel, and also holds the minute hand.  The hour wheel slips over the cannon pinion, and is driven by the minute wheel, using the cannon pinion as it's axle.  

During setting, the intermediate wheel will be turned by the winding pinion, and will turn the minute wheel, which will make the cannon pinion slip on the center wheel shaft.  

 The Escapement

The escapement consists of the balance, hairspring, lever and escape wheel.  When force is applied to the escape wheel by the fourth wheel, it will begin to turn, forcing  one of the pallet jewels (referred to as jewel A) away, but bringing the other pallet jewel (B) into position to stop the movement after a 1/2 tooth rotation.  The tail end of the fork will send an impulse to the balance through the impulse jewel.  This will cause the balance to rotate in one direction until it is reversed by the tension of the hairspring.  When the balance reverses, it will push the fork in the oppoisite direction, moving jewel B out of the way, and allowing the escape wheel to rotate. As the escape rotates, it supplies an impule to jewel B, which will again send an impulse through the tail (in the opposite direction of the first one) to the balance wheel, causing it to rotate.  Additionally, jewel A will move into position to block the rotatin of the escape wheel after 1/2 tooth of rotation.  Once again the balance will be reversed by the hairspring, moving jewel A agian until it can again be pushed out of the way, repeating the cycle. 

The mass of the balance wheel and the length and stiffness of the hairspring combine to have a natural resonant frequency--generally between 5 and 8 half-cycles (or beats) per second on a wristwatch. Each beat will cause one jump of the seconds hand.  The outside of the hairspring is held to the balance cock by the hairspring stud, while the inside is held to the balance by the collet.    Generally either the stud or the collet is moveable to allow the balance to be adjusted &quot;in beat&quot;, where the motion is centered on the fork rather than turning farther in one direciton than the other. 

In most watches, the hairspring will pass through the regulator, a slot on a moveable arm.  When this arm is moved closer to the stud, the working length of the spring is longer, slowing the resonant frequencey, causing the watch to run slower.  Moving it away from the stud speeds the watch up.  A few watches have no regulator, instead relying on moveable weights on the balance to adjust the resonant frequency and rate of the watch.

== Introduction ==

Acoustic experiments often require to realise measurements in rooms with special characteristics. Two types of rooms can be distinguished: anechoic rooms and reverberation rooms.

== Anechoic room ==

The principle of this room is to simulate a free field. In a free space, the acoustic waves are propagated from the source to infinity. In a room, the reflections of the sound on the walls produce a wave which is propagated in the opposite direction and comes back to the source. In anechoic rooms, the walls are very absorbent in order to eliminate these reflections. The sound seems to die down rapidly.
The materials used on the walls are rockwool, glasswool or foams, which are materials that absorb sound in relatively wide frequency bands. Cavities are dug in the wool so that the large wavelength corresponding to bass frequencies are absorbed too.
Ideally the sound pressure level of a punctual sound source decreases about 6 dB per a distance doubling.

Anechoic rooms are used in the following experiments:

&lt;center&gt;
Intensimetry: measurement of the acoustic power of a source. 
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
Study of the source directivity. 
&lt;/center&gt;

== Reverberation room ==

The walls of a reverberation room mostly consist of concrete and are covered with reflecting paint. Alternative design consist of sandwich panels with metal surface. The sound reflects a lot of time on the walls before dying down. It gives a similar impression of a sound in a cathedral. Ideally all sound energy is absorbed by air.
Because of all these reflections, a lot of plane waves with different directions of propagation interfere in each point of the room. Considering all the waves is very complicated so the acoustic field is simplified by the diffuse field hypothesis: the field is homogeneous and isotropic. Then the pressure level is uniform in the room. The truth of this thesis increases with ascending frequency, resulting in a lower limiting frequency for each reverberation room, where the density of standing waves is sufficient.

Several conditions are required for this approximation:
The absorption coefficient of the walls must be very low (α&lt;0.2)
The room must have geometrical irregularities (non-parallel walls, diffusor objects) to avoid nodes of pressure of the resonance modes.

With this hypothesis, the theory of Sabine can be applied. It deals with the reverberation time which is the time required to the sound level to decrease of 60dB. T depends on the volume of the room V, the absorption coefficient αi and the area Si of the different materials in the room :

Reverberation rooms are used in the following experiments:
&lt;center&gt;
measurement of the ability of a material to absorb a sound
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
measurement of the ability of a partition to transmit a sound
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
Intensimetry
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
measurement of sound power
&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Readers should be advised that this Wikibook summary (of the economic dislocations
and the ensuing political realignment of the United States) is the version
that survived in folk mythology and public school textbooks.   The truth
was worse than the sad facts related here.  The impact on American
life was profound and the political about-face into a federal welfare state
was long lasting.  In the form of debate about social security reform, it
haunts US electoral politics still.  As recounted here, the story demonizes
Hoover for all the wrong reasons.  There was nothing &quot;classical&quot; about Hoover's
economics, and his many interventions rather than being &quot;laissez-faire&quot; are
likely causes of the crash; culminating in the Smoot-Hawley tariff whose
progress through congress coincided with the collapsing prices almost hour
by hour.  9,000 banks failed in that era in part because banking law confined
their savings and loan portfolios to one geographic region, preventing
diversification and protecting marginal banks from competitive pressures.
Agricultural practices blamed for the Dust Bowl began during WWI, when the
Wilson administration subsidized food production so generously (&quot;Wheat at any price&quot;)
that marginal prairie land was hastily cultivated.   A mechanism for
the nationwide credit expansion of the 1920s had recently been systematized
under the (1913) Federal Reserve Board.  It was operating to soften the
bursting bubble of those wartime farm prices.  

The true picture of these flawed business practices should be balanced
against some explanation of what incentivized them or protected them from
normal market force corrections.  As many and varied as these structural
problems were, it is a further mistake to credit  FDR's opportunistic
power grab and theft of private resources with their &quot;cure&quot;.
Substantial opinion exists (and contemporary opinion existed) to the contrary.
Like most textbooks, this article practically beatifies FDR for
&quot;acting&quot; and offers scant critical judgement of his programs: just a brief
mention that several were officially certified as unconstitutional - couldn't
those conservative judges get with the program?.  

During the 1930s, Americans were urged (by propaganda and coercive codes) to
de-emphasize private entrepreneurship as a way to build common wealth and
instead to depend upon regimens of &quot;social responsibility&quot; under a
succession of schemes for wealth redistribution, labor force reallocation,
wage and price controls, banking, monetary, and commercial regulation of
numerous sorts, all planned by agencies that held no ownership stake
in the resources they were redeploying.  Although their accomplishments
included many tangible benefits to the nation, on balance the New Deal
decade drained the measurable wealth of America.  Its recovery during
WWII is impressive only relative to the ruination of the Eurasian nations
in whose cities and farms it was fought - American life was not happier,
safer, or easier in wartime, even though employment rebounded.

Although the sad lesson of the (temporary) ruin of the United States is
instructive in the hard facts of economic reality and the folly of
seeking solely political solutions, the Great Depression was not confined
to the U.S.; it affected nearly all industrialized societies.  It stressed
each of their social nets differently, but generally increased the powers
of national governments, which soon sought relief in warfare.
Indeed, the universality of the economic strain tells us that fundamental
laws of economics operated here; thus the academic challenge to explain
events and discover those laws has been pursued by every school of
economic and political thought.

A student interested in busting the many myths repeated by this article should
be wary of political and economic bias in any research materials found. 
Historical perspective does not come cheap.  I hope my contrary telling of
this story piques the reader's interest enough to read further and more critically.

If my version of events rings true in any respect, it may be because it
is rooted in an economic theory that forecasted the crash, and was then villified
by those who found they were benefitting from the bad times.

---------- There, that should seed some discussion, enjoy!   Greg Jaxon

== Need some backgrounder on economics ==

This is an economic topic, and it would be good to cover a few key issues.  Explain what a depression is, and why it's called the Great Depression, and others were named by year. Explain Keynes and classical economics. Explain speculative bubbles (also, avoid using jargon before it's defined). Explain what a &quot;run on the banks&quot; is. Treat the GD as a global phenomenon -- it happened in Europe as well, and was one reason why Hitler came to power and why protectionism was significant.

There are some different theories about &quot;the true nature of the Great Depression&quot; from different schools of thought, and these are controversial ideas that should be avoided.  Instead of getting into deeper detail about fiscal issues, it would be good to broaden the scope of understanding so it's more global, and maybe also deal with how people and families experienced the GD.

== Europe &amp; America ==

Just as there is a lack of material on America in WW II two chapters hence (mobilization, the Home Front, Japanese Internment), there is a lack of material on American reaction to foreign affairs in this chapter. Pacifism, isolationism, and the American Bund are part of this. Put in the section on Black Communists here, rather than in the next chapter.

== Time, Ladies and Gentlemen! ==

The writing is not as good as it ought to be because it ignores time constraints: stuff about Roosevelt mingles with stuff about Herbert Hoover. I feel this is connected to an earlier complaint: discussion about economics would help structure what happened and why.

I think this introduction would be confusing and information-poor for someone not familiar with the topic. IMHO, it would be better to focus on JavaScript, and give a history of it, and leave it's relationship to HTML and the DOM to the end of the introduction. Yes, the most common use of JavaScript is to script web pages, and but that is a seperate discussion to the language itself. First you learn what the languasge is and how it works, then you learn to apply it to specific applications (such as client-side web page scripting). Comments?

:Yes, it does seem a little odd. Especially since it says in the introduction itself, &quot;there is almost no relation between the two languages.&quot; Maybe the general catagory, &quot;Programming&quot; would be better, or create a new subcategory under Programming, for &quot;JavaScript.&quot;--[[User:Dbolton|Dbolton]] 19:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article needs work and appears to be wrong.
What is the origin of this recipe?  This is not cashew chicken as served in Springfield, Missouri where it originated.  Cashews are a garnish added at the very end along with green onions.  There are no vegetables in cashew chicken, ''that'' is a variation.  The recipe should be (as reasonably close) as the one first used at Leong's Tea House in Springfield where the dish was first invented.  Using vegetables and other methods are the variations.  I lived in Springfield, Missouri all my life and never ate this at a Chinese restaurant.[[User:Rt66lt|Rt66lt]] 18:09, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

:This was already neatly described in the &quot;variations&quot; section. Leong might know his audience, but damn that's not normal cashew chicken. See [[Cookbook:Leong's Cashew Chicken]] for the recipe. (would Midwestern Cashew Chicken be a better name?) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:18, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

I have lived in Springfield, MO for five years now.  Before that I lived in San Francisco (they have a few good Chinese restaurants there), New York City (as well), and Boston.  The cashew chicken served here in the so-called &quot;Birthplace of Cashew Chicken&quot; is nothing more than fried chicken with brown gravy, and cashews sprinkled on top.  Who let the hillbilly into the kitchen?

== soy sauce listed in a 'gluten-free' recipe? ==

I'm trying to find a gluten-free recipe, and happy to have this resource, but lo and behold, I see that soy sauce is listed here without any caveat or gluten warnings, yet wheat (i.e., gluten) appears to be a primary ingredient in soy sauce. This makes me question other recipes on the gluten free list...bummer!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General Apraxia'''

Apraxia is the partial or complete loss of one's ability to perform deliberate movements. This results from cortical lesions where there is no paralysis or loss of sensory functioning. 

'''Akinetic Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterized by the inability to perform spontaneous movements.

'''Amnesic Apraxia'''

Also known as amnestic apraxia, is apraxia which is characterised by an inability to carry out sequence(s) of movement upon request. Generally, the cause for this is deteriorated memory.

'''Buccofacial Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by an inability to carry out voluntary movements involving the face, mouth and tongue.

'''Constructional Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by a deficit in the ability to draw or assemble objects. This form of apraxia is caused by lesions in the right hemisphere, usually on the right parietal lobe.

'''Ideational Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by the improper use of objects caused by an inability to identify them correctly or to conceptualize their appropriate functions.

'''Ideokinetic Apraxia'''

Apraxia which is characterised by an inability to carry out a series of ordered movements. The patient is usually able to carry out individual orders, but is confused by a sequence of orders.

'''Ideomotor Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by the inability to execute a single, complex movement properly. The patient performs inappropriate movements in the course of action.

'''Left Parietal Apraxia'''

This is apraxia caused by damage to the posterior lobe of the left hemisphere.'

'''Motor Apraxia'''

Apraxia involving the inability to carry out planned acts.

'''Ocular Apraxia'''

Apraxia characterised by an inability to maintain fixation. With Ocular Apraxia, the patient's eyes wander back and forth between objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Definition of Generalized Agnosia'''

A defect in recognition, where a patient can generally sense objects and forms, but is unable to consciously recognize and interpret the meaning of the sensory input.

'''Apperceptive Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterised by recognition failure caused by impairment in visual perception. Patients are unable to recognize objects despite having normal acuity.

'''Associative Agnosia'''

A visual Agnosia characterised by the lack of meaning associated with percepts despite the patient being able to normally percieve an object and draw it.

'''Auditory Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterised by the inability to recognize sounds despite the patient having normal auditory functioning. Auditory Agnosia is typically associated with nonspeech sounds. When agnosia involves speech, it is referred to as &quot;pure word deafness&quot;

'''Ideational Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterised by faulty recognition and interpretation of symbols.

'''Landmark Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize stable objects in the environment. Patients can typically describe them in detail, but are unable to describe or recognize them.

'''Tactile Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize and interpret objects by touch.

'''Visual Agnosia'''

Agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize and interpret objects in the visual field. Visual Agnosia may also sometimes be referred to as &quot;Optic Agnosia&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Dementia is the loss of intellectual capacity to the extent that normal social and occupational functions can no longer be carried out.

== Alzheimer's Disease ==
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive form of dementia characterized by the grandual deterioration of intellectual abilities such as memory, judgement, capacity for abstract thought, and other higher-level cognitive functions.

The onset of presenile Alzheimer's disease is usually after the age of 40 and consists of three main phases. The first phase lasts for 2 to 3 years, and is characterized by failing memory, muddled inefficiency over mundane tasks as well as spatial disorientation. Mood disorders are prominent and take the form of perplexity, agitation and restless hyperactivity. In the second phase, there is greater intellectual and personality deterioration. Focal symptoms also appear. In the third (or terminal) stage, there is extreme apathetic dementia in which the patient becomes bedridden. Neurological disabilities may develop, such as spastic hemiparesis (hemispheric paralysis) or severe striatal rigidity (irregular streaks or patches of nerve cell loss in the cerebral cortex) and tremor.

Histologically, there is degeneratoin and loss of nerve cells which affects the outer three cortical layers and the thalamus as well as secondary glial proliferatoin (the rapid growth of the plial cells which perform support tasks such as production of the myelin sheath and nutritional support). Senile plaques and neurofibrallary tangles are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and the neurofibrillary tangles occur in grey matter, particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala. The senile plaque lie within the nerve cells and often fill the entire cell body, and may have no core and appear to consist on ly of granular or filamentous fragments. Cortical atrophy (the wasting away of the cortex) is also present and tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes. The white matter shows axonal degeneration, hyperplasia (the increase in organ size caused by an abnormal increase in number of cells) of astrocytes as well as fibrous gliosis (the replacement of neuron cells by glia cells). Other characteristic features include shrinking of the brain, flattening of the gyri, widening of the sulci and enlarging of the ventricles.

The walls of intracerebral arteries tend to thicken with advancing age. The collagen in the outer layers become more prominent which causes the wall and surrounding tissue to die and, in most cases, disintegrate. There is an interference of cerebral cirulation which is caused by blockage of the common carotid, inner carotid and venebral arteries in the neck and bony channels of the skull. With regards neuro-chemistry, there are also deficiencies in neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin and somatostatin.

there seem to be certain general triggers for Alzheirmer's diseas such as minimal brain damage from head injury, infection and surgery. However, the illness is usually already in existence, and these &quot;triggers&quot; or precipitants have merely revealed the problem.

As so far as treatment is concerned, there is no cure. However, cutting edge research in stem cell development is showing promising results for counteracting the degenerative effects of Alzheimer's Disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section sets out the general rubric of the charge to corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (1) raises the charge on profits of companies. Profits are defined in Subsection (5), [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|company]] is defined in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA)]]. This definition includes overseas companies, and it is left to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11 of ICTA]] to restrict the scope of the charge for overseas entities.&lt;br&gt;

Tax is charged, and the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Corporation Tax Acts|Corporation Tax Acts]] apply for any [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Financial year|Financial year]] for which Parliament charges corporation tax. The wording is formulated in this way because corporation tax, like income tax, is still a temporary tax which must be imposed annually, although in practice it is inconceivable that a Parliament will fail to levy the tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) provides that where a company is [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK resident]] (and so within the full charge), or overseas resident but not scoped out of the charge to corporation tax by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11 of ICTA]], the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definition/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] (and therefore the charge to income tax) do not apply. &lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) removes any charge to capital gains tax on gains on which it is charged to corporation tax or would be so chargeable but for an exemption from corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) defines &quot;profits&quot; and widens the meaning of &quot;trade&quot; for the purposes of Sections 7 to 12, 114, 115 (subject to 115(7)) and 248, and Part VIII, Chapter IV of Part X, and Part XI, except where the context requires otherwise. '''[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Profits|Profits]]''' are defined as [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income|income]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Chargeable gains|chargeable gains]]. '''Trade''' is taken to include '''vocation''', and to include an office or employment.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4A) extends the meaning of '''[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Profession|profession]]''' to include vocation in Sections 74(1), 79(1), 79A(1), 79B(1), 83A(1), 84(1), 86(1), 86A(2)(a), 87(1), (2) and (4), 88, 89, 90(1) and (3), 94(1), 100(2)(b), 101, 102, 401(1), 491(10), 577(7)(b), 579(2), 588(3), 589A(8) and 817(2), and in paragraph 5(11) of Schedule 30.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (5) notes that Part VIII contains general provisions relating to the taxation of profits of companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that no payment made by a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/company|company]] shall be treated as income tax, and also that a requirement to withhold income tax imposed by the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] stands notwithstanding that the company is not within the charge to income tax itself.

Subsection (2) provides that subject to provision for the contrary, a UK resident company that has received a payment net of withheld income tax may set that income tax off against its corporation tax liability of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/accounting period|accounting period]] in which the receipt is brought into the corporation tax charge, or would have been brought into the corporation tax charge but for an exemption from corporation tax.

Subsection (3) disapplies subsection (2) for a payment of loan interest to which [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 369 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 369 of ICTA]] applies. Section 369 deals with mortgage relief at source. As mortgage relief at source no longer applies, this subsection no longer has any practical effect.

Subsection (4) expands, for the purposes of this section, the references to payments received by a company to include references to payments received by another person on behalf of or in trust for the company. It also excludes money received by a company on behalf of or in trust for another person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that, subject to an explicit exception in the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Corporation Tax Acts|Corporation Tax Acts]], [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|companies]] are taxed on their worldwide profits.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) makes it clear that a company is taxable on all profits accruing to its benefits, including profits of trusts and partnerships, if it would be taxed on them if it received the profits direct. Except in the case where the company is being wound up (where it receives profits for the benefit of its creditors or members, as appropriate), it is not taxed on profits it receives in a fiduciary capacity. This subsection (which is well supported by case law) effectively states that for tax purposes you look at beneficial, not legal, ownership of profits.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) provides that corporation tax is computed and chargeable by reference to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting periods]], although tax is charged by reference to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Financial year|financial years]]. The profits of accounting periods are apportioned between the financial years in which the accounting period falls.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that corporation tax is charged under income tax principles, unless there is a provision to the contrary, and for these purposes the corporation tax term &quot;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Accounting period|accounting period]]&quot; is taken to be the period of reference rather than the income tax term &quot;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Year of assessment|Year of assessment]]&quot;. This provision derives from when corporation tax was first introduced in 1965 (prior to which companies were charged to income tax). Since 2003, various parts of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] have been rewritten so that the same provisions no longer apply for both income tax and corporation tax. This process is not yet complete, but by the end of the decade, corporation tax should be a completely stand-alone tax, no longer relying on income tax provisions for its base.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) makes it clear what income tax law applies for each accounting period, and also that provisions relating specifically to individuals do not apply to persons within the charge to corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2A) provides that corporation tax on income is not charged under the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (ITTOIA). Subsection (2B) goes on to provide that instead income is chargeable under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] and the Cases of Schedule D. Subsection (2C) also deems Schedules A and D to apply to income tax for the purposes of corporation tax. In essence, these subsections contain transitional provisions that apply whilst corporation tax law is being decoupled from income tax law - once the decoupling is complete, they will no longer be necessary.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) provides that total profits are assessed under and computed under the rules in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] and also under Parts 2 (employment income), 9 (pension income) and 10 (social security income) of ITEPA (which impose the charge to income) tax plus [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Chargeable gain|chargeable gains]].&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) provides that where a provision of the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] apart from ITTOIA provides for an exemption from income tax, or charges a person to income tax, then unless otherwise provided, there is a similar exemption from or charge to corporation tax.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (5) makes it clear that although corporation tax and income tax are distinct taxes, the same statutory provision may apply to them. This also allows certain provisions to ensure tax neutrality between persons within the charge to corporation tax and income tax by being a rule for corporation tax as far as the former is concerned, and a rule for income tax as far as the latter is concerned. A charge to corporation tax (or income tax) is a charge to the other, and an exemption from corporation tax (or income tax) is an exemption to the other, unless expressed explicitly to the contrary.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (6) states that the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Income Tax Acts|Income Tax Acts]] referred to in the section are to be taken as excluding Section 1 to 5, Part VII or Sections 348 to 350 of ICTA, and notes that the above rules do not refer to which period income are taxed in, except to the extent that this results from apportioning income of the whole period to different parts of a period.

hi there

== About this article in general ==
Hello, as we have in our [http://klexikon.zum.de/wiki/Hilfe:In_English Klexikon] the Allosaurus on our list of planned articles, I was looking at this page here. It seems to be a great text. I see questions as section heads, as we have it in the Klexikon, but that does not seem to be universal in the English Wikibooks Wikijunior project?

Sometimes I wondered about some terms. For example, I don't know what the Morrison formation is, I would have to look that up. Maybe US American children know the term? 

I also wasn't sure about the sectio &quot;What to we have to learn?&quot; Is it meant, what human scientists still don't know about that dinosaur, or is it meant, what the reader of the article should learn as an individual? [[User:Ziko|Ziko]] ([[User talk:Ziko|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ziko|contribs]]) 15:59, 9 August 2015 (UTC)

: Several of our Wikijunior books have a standard page form in which the standard section-headings are questions.  [[WJ:Languages]] and [[WJ:World Religions]] come to mind.

: I believe &quot;What do we have to learn?&quot; is meant to be about what human scientists don't know about that that dinosaur.  The wording seems less than ideal; suggestions for better wording?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:58, 9 August 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Events sorted chronologically ===
This section of the book lists disastrous events until the last century. We have intentionally not listed more recent events because they may be still under active dispute, badly attributed, too painful and in general still open to distinct interpretation and requiring further analysis.

==== 20th century ====

===== 1980s =====
*[[w:Armero tragedy|1985 Nevado del Ruiz Lahar disaster]] - The 'Volcán del Ruiz', had been for more than a century a dormant giant, which travelers in the Bogotá-Cali flights had the pleasure to observe, covered with a large snow cap.

:With 5,389 m (17,780 ft), Nevado del Ruiz is the highest of the Colombian volcanoes in the Central Range of the Colombian Andes. 

:Although this volcano had caused lahars in 1595 and 1845, causing hundreds of deaths, the rich valley of [[w:Armero|Armero]] under the peak, was excellent agricultural land. The town of Armero grew for more than a century, without anyone remembering the old disasters. 

:Late in 1984, geologists began to notice small earthquakes and steam eruptions in the volcano. Although a network of monitoring devices was setup on the summit of the volcano, nothing would predict the terrible events that followed a year later.

:In November 1985 the smoke from the summit of Nevado del Ruiz, was plainly visible, but both authorities and scientists alike didn't believe these were the preliminaries of a plynian pyroclastic eruption.

:Despite the warnings local authorities in Armero, and state officials keep saying no eruption would follow, although a risk map was in place.

:On the night of November 13, 1985, at  around 3:00 pm there was an explosion and ashes fell over the region, but even then local authorities and priests in Armero asked the people to remain calm in their houses. However at 9:30 pm. the volcano, covered with storm clouds, erupted with rock ejection and pyroclastic discharges which melted the snow cap. Melted water and pyroclastic ashes and rocks mixed and produced a series of lahars, mud and rock slides along the rivers.

:Just half an hour short of midnight on November 13, 1985 a massive Lahar caused by the eruption of the volcano, ran down the Lagunillas river, in central Colombia, and jumped in a 200 high wave of rocks, mud and debris over the town of Armero, 28,000 inhabitants. In the next 10 minutes close to 80% of Armero was destroyed. The death toll of both the lahar that hit Armero and other lahars was estimated at 21,000 deaths.

===== 1930s =====
*[[w:Holodomor|1932 - Ukraine - Black Famine]] - A Man-Made Famine raged through Ukraine, the ethnic-Ukrainian region of northern Caucasus, and the lower Volga River region in 1932-33. Between 7 to 10 million people, mainly Ukrainians, starved to death. 

:Planned by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the main goal of this artificial famine was to break the spirit of the Ukrainian peasant farmer and to force them into collectivization. In 1932, the Soviets increased the grain procurement quota for Ukraine by 44%. Soviet law was quite clear - no grain could be given to feed the peasants until the quota was met, aware that this extraordinary high quota would result in a grain shortage leaving Ukrainian peasant unable to feed themselves. 

:When some peasants attempted to hide grain from the Soviet Government, Communist party officials with the aid of military troops and NKVD secret police units moved into the area. To insure Ukrainian peasants could not travel in search of food, an internal passport system was implemented to restrict movements. 

:While Ukrainians were starving, Ukrainian grain was collected and stored in grain elevators that were guarded by military units &amp; NKVD secret police units.
*[[/Great Depression/]]

===== 1910s =====
*[[w:Great Lakes Storm of 1913|1913 - Great Lakes, USA &amp; Canada - Great Lakes storm]][[Image:Titanic-New York Herald front page.jpeg|thumb]]
*1912 - Atlantic Ocean - Sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic a Olympic-class passenger liner owned by the White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard. On the night of 14 April 1912, during her maiden voyage, Titanic struck an iceberg at a spot around four hundred miles south of Newfoundland, and sank two hours and forty minutes later in early 15 April 1912. There was no long gash in the ship as expected from the iceberg collision but many tiny gashes that led to the flood of the water. Her fireman compared the sound of the impact to &quot;the tearing of calico, nothing more.&quot; However, the collision was fatal and the icy water soon poured through the ship. It became obvious that many would not find safety in a lifeboat. Each passenger was issued a life jacket but life expectancy would be short when exposed to water four degrees below freezing. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, ranking it as one of the worst peacetime maritime disasters in history and by far the most infamous. The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available. It was on of the most luxurious and largest steamship at the time and was popularly believed to be “unsinkable” - indeed, in a 1910 White Star Line brochure advertising the Titanic, claiming that it was &quot;designed to be unsinkable&quot;. It was a great shock to many that despite the advanced technology and experienced crew, the Titanic still sank with a great loss of life. The media frenzy about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about what happened on board the ship, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck in 1985 by an American and French team, led by Robert Ballard have made Titanic persistently famous in the years since.

===== 1900s =====
[[Image:General slocum burning.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Firefighters working to extinguish the General Slocum]]
*[[w:PS General Slocum|1904 - New York City, USA - General Slocum disaster]] - The '''''General Slocum''''' was a [[w:steamship|steamship]] launched in [[w:1891|1891]]. It caught fire and burned to the water line in [[w:New York|New York]]'s [[w:East River|East River]] on [[w:June 15|June 15]], [[w:1904|1904]]. Over 1,000 people died in the tragedy, making it New York City's worst loss-of-life disaster until the [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the World Trade Center.  The Captain, William Van Schaick, and the rest of the crew suffered no fatalities, although the Captain lost sight in one eye due to the fire. There were many acts of heroism among the passengers, witnesses, and emergency personnel.

*[[w:Krakatoa|1883 - Indonesia - Krakatoa volcano's eruption]]

==== 18th century ====
[[Image:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|340px|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of Lisbon in flames and a tsunami overwhelming the ships in the harbor.]]
*[[w:1755 Lisbon earthquake|1755 Lisbon, Portugal earthquake]] -  Took place on November 1, 1755, at 9:20 in the morning. It was one of the most destructive and deadly [[w:earthquakes|earthquakes]] in history, killing well over 70,000 people. The quake was followed by a [[w:tsunami|tsunami]] and fire, resulting in the near total destruction of [[w:Lisbon|Lisbon]].

:The earthquake accentuated political tensions in [[w:Portugal|Portugal]] and profoundly disrupted the country's 18th century colonial ambitions. The event was widely discussed by European Enlightenment [[philosophy|philosophers]], and inspired major developments in [[w:theodicy|theodicy]] and in the philosophy of the [[w:sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The first to be studied scientifically for its effects over a large area, the quake signaled the birth of modern [[w:seismology|seismology]]. [[w:Geologists|Geologists]] today estimate the Lisbon earthquake approached magnitude 9 on the Richter scale, with an [[w:epicenter|epicenter]] in the Atlantic Ocean about 200&amp;nbsp;km west-southwest of [[w:Cape St. Vincent|Cape St. Vincent]].

:The geological causes of this earthquake and the seismic activity in the region continue to be discussed and debated by contemporary scientists. Some geologists have suggested that the earthquake may indicate the early development of an Atlantic subduction zone, and the beginning of the closure of the Atlantic ocean.

*[[/Bubonic Plague/]] The black death occurred in almost all of Europe, killing one third of the population. It was caused by a disease carried by fleas (and spread by rats) and transmitted to humans

== Welcome! ==  

I hope you found some Poly Science classes.  If not perhaps we could start some by playing with some political discussion formats either here locally or at wikireason. (Link on the front page.   We could pick some topics or current issues and invite people from a few communities such as kurohin5, slash/dot, and advogato to help discuss it.   Hope to see you around.  If you get bored or busy, please checkback.  I think we are finally nearing some effective initialization.  BTW Might run a search on wikibooks or wikpedia regarding specific political topics.  Later. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 06:12, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

P.S.  Consider adding your name to the overall participant list[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversity:participants] or at specific courses of interest to help others with similar interests find you.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Wikizach. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Wikizach~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

As you can see from these examples, many letters in the Greek alphabet look like their
counterparts in English. There are multiple spellings for some of these sounds:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| ι, η, υ, οι, ει, and  υι all sound alike.
|-
| ε and  αι sound like EH as in &quot;kettle&quot;.
|-
| ο and  ω sound like OH as in &quot;over&quot;.
|}

===Consonants===
The following letters sound like the English letters they resemble:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
| κ, τ
|}

''Note: If you're a native English speaker, try to pronounce a plain τ, that is '''without''' the &quot;h&quot; sound in the end.''

Reading practice:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| τα, τι, η, τη, το, του, τω, κάτω, κότα, άκου
|}

Most Greek words have a stressed syllable which in words of more than one syllable is shown with an accent over the stressed vowel.

One of the big obstacles for an English speaker trying to learn Greek is that so few common usage words are related to English ones (although an estimated 10% to 20% of the total English vocabulary has Greek roots, most of it though of scientific/technical nature). However, sometimes there is a relationship that would help you to remember the Greek word, but the relationship isn't obvious, as with ευχαριστώ and Eucharist. When this happens, we'll note it as in the example above, with ~. This may mean that the English word is derived from the Greek one, or merely that both the English word and the Greek one come from a common root.

===Personal subject pronouns===
Greek has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Here are the personal subject pronouns:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|        εγώ
| I
|     εμείς
| we 
|-
|     εσύ
| you, singular 
|   εσείς
| you, plural 
|-
|     αυτός
| he 
|  αυτοί
| they (masculine) 
|-
|     αυτή
| she
|  αυτές
| they (feminine) 
|-
|     αυτό
| it
|  αυτά
| they (neuter)
|-
 |}
The second-person plural is also used as the formal form of address, even when speaking to a single person.

{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1h}}

===Verbs===

====First conjugation====
The subject pronouns are usually omitted, because the form of the verb indicates the subject. For example:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
|  γράφω
| I write
|-
|  γράφεις
| you (singular) write
|-
|  γράφει
| he/she/it writes
|-
|  γράφουμε
| we write
|-
|  γράφετε
| you (plural) write
|-
|  γράφουν
| they write
|-
|}
There is no infinitive in modern Greek. For naming a verb, the first-person singular of the present tense is used as a generic term. For example, we refer to the verb  γράφω, ''to write.''

To summarize the conjugation of a verb, we write it in a table like this:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  γράφω
|   γράφουμε 
|-
|   γράφεις
|  γράφετε 
|-
|  γράφει
|  γράφουν  
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i}}

Γράφω is an example of a verb belonging to the first conjugation. Verbs in this conjugation can be recognized because their accent falls before the final ω.

The following verbs belong to the first conjugation:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| δίνω
| give (~&quot;donate&quot;)
|-
| αλλάζω
| change
|-
| διαβάζω
| read
|-
| κοιτάζω
| look at
|-
| βλέπω
| see
|-
| ακούω
| hear (~&quot;acoustic&quot;)
|-
| φτάνω
| arrive
|-
| φεύγω
| leave
|-
| παίρνω
| take
|-
| αγοράζω
| buy
|-
| ξέρω
| know
|-
| νομίζω
| think
|-
| βάζω
| put
|-
| πίνω
| drink
|}

Vocabulary: {{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i2}}

Conjugations of some of these verbs: {{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i3}}

====The verbs έχω, ''to have,'' and  είμαι, ''to be''====
Two important verbs are  έχω, ''to have,'' and  είμαι, ''to be.''  The first-conjugation verb  έχω is regular
in the present tense, so it has the same endings as  γράφω.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  	 έχω
|  έχουμε 
|-
|  	 έχεις
|  έχετε 
|-
|  	 έχει
|  έχουν 
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1j}}

''To be'' in English is expressed
in the active voice, but the Greek  είμαι is passive, and doesn't have an active form.
The ending  -μαι is a typical, regular ending for passive verbs. Although we won't be
concerned with passive constructions until later,  είμαι is so important that you need
to get it under your belt right away.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|  	 είμαι
|  είμαστε 
|-
|  	 είσαι
|  είστε 
|-
|  	 είναι
|  είναι
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1k}}

===Capital letters===

Now that we're ready to handle complete sentences, we need capital letters.
Most of the capital letters of the Greek alphabet are similar in form either to the lowercase letters, or
to their counterparts in the Latin alphabet:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_no_audio_color}}&quot;
|   α
|  Α 
|  ι 
|  Ι 
|  ρ
|   Ρ 
|-

|  κ 
|  Κ 
|  σ
|   Σ 
|-
|  γ 
|  Γ 
|   λ
|  Λ 
|  τ
|   Τ 
|-
|  δ 
|  Δ 
|   μ
|  Μ
|  υ

|  Ο
|  ψ
|  Ψ  
|-
|   θ
|  Θ 
| π 
|  Π
|  ω
|   Ω 
|-
|}

===Sentences===
The order of words in a Greek sentence is much more free than in English, but you can correctly construct a sentence using the familiar English syntax of subject+verb, or subject+verb+object. The subject is usually omitted when it is a pronoun.

Sentences:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   Είναι καλό.
| It is good.
|-
|   Είναι κακό.
| It is bad.
|-
 |}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1l}}

In Greek, adjectives change their endings to agree with the gender and number of the nouns
they describe (''declension''). The following vocabulary list introduces some nouns that happen to be neuter,
and some adjectives, which are given in neuter form. The word το is the definite article, like English &quot;the,&quot; used with
singular neuter nouns.

===Summary of the alphabet and pronunciation===
====Alphabet / Αλφάβητο====
The '''Greek Language''' was one of the first written languages in all world. The [[w:Script|script]] used had some peculiarities not observed today: for instance, the vowels were not written, and one needed to guess or to know their specific place inside the word. This alphabet has been evolving, through contact with other cultures and through the simple action of the time, until it became what it is today. Amongst the Greek alphabet, we can spot some (or even many) similarities with the [[w:Latin alphabet|Latin (or Roman) one]]. The alphabet used nowadays has 24 letters: 7 vowels and 17 consonants.

Besides the alphabet, there is also an accent ( ´ ) and a diaeresis( ¨ ). The use of these two [[w:Diacritic|diacritics]] is discussed in the [[Greek: Phonology|next section]].

====Pronunciation of the Alphabet====
Greek sounds are, in general, soft. As a major rule, each letter carries a single sound (this is not universal, but almost, as we'll see later in this page). As in the [[Greek: Alphabet|previous chapter]], we see here a table with the various letters. This time, the columns represent not the name, but the ''approximate'' sound of the letters.

'''Note''': The letter Γγ is the most difficult to pronounce for an English speaker: it is like a stronger '''h''', simultaneous with the vibration of the vocal cords;  in other words, it is the voiced counterpart of the '''χ'''. Before '''e''' and '''i''' vowels, it is pronounced as a '''y''' like in the word '''y'''es.

====Diphthongs====
''[[w:Diphthongs|Diphthongs]]'' are combinations of two vowels that function as a unique sound. Note that in Modern Greek, the word ''Diphthong'' (δίφθογγος) is also used for combination of vowels that sound like a simple vowel. There are eight diphthongs in Modern Greek. There are also some similar combinations of consonants:

====Accent and Diaeresis====
Most Greek words have a ''stressed syllable'' which is the syllable said with more strength: for instance, in the English words ''comfort'' and ''peculiarity'', the stressed syllables are ''com'' and ''ar'', respectively.

Greek marks the stressed syllable with an '''accent''' mark ( ΄ ) over the vowel. In one-syllable words, the accent is usually omitted. When the stress falls on a syllable that has a diphthong, the accent is used above the last letter of this diphthong. Thus, words like Παύλος (''Paul'') ou γυναίκα (''woman''), are correctly accented. 

If the accent is put on the first vowel of a diphthong, it is not read as a diphthong but read as two independent vowels, as in the word ρολόι (''watch'' or ''clock''), which has three syllables, not two. On the other hand, if one wishes to separate the diphthong, but the accent falls on other syllable, the '''diaeresis''' ( ¨ ) is used, as in the word Εβραϊκός (''Hebrew'').

There are, however, some words that aren't stressed (usually monosyllabic grammatical words), and these don't have an accent. Words like these are read as affixes added to the main word. '''Examples''':
*'''ο (''the'' masc.)''' &quot;Ο πατέρας&quot; (''The father'') is read as a single word - ''aw-pah-TE-ras'';
*'''μου (''my'')''', &quot;Ο πατέρας μου&quot; (''My father'') is also read as a single word - ''aw-pa-TE-raz-mu''.

Every stressed word with more than one syllable carries an accent. However, there are monosyllabic words that also have accent, like ή (''or'') and πού (''where''). This accent has a double function:
*It distinguishes words that, otherwise, would be equal - η (''the'' fem.) and που (''that, which'');
*It marks words as strong, unlike their weak comparing counterparts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Writing Software to Play the Ancient Game of Go ==
{{wikipedia|Computer Go}}
[[w:Go (board game)|Go]] is a strategic, two-player game that originated in ancient China thousands of years ago. It is popular throughout East Asia, and is gaining popularity among computer programmers because of its extraordinary complexity. Whereas the top chess-playing computer programs are now better than the top human grand masters, the best Go-playing computer programs currently in existence can be defeated even by amateur Go players.

The rules of Go are simple, but the strategies complex; the sheer number of legal moves at any point in the game make programming an effective opponent a daunting task. This book endeavors to help the novice who is beginning to write software to play the ancient game of Go, as well as to provide a useful resource to those already skilled in the art.

==The Go Community==
It is becoming very common for Go players to use the Internet to meet, discuss games, and play one another. Many strong players now regularly [[Computer Go/Playing Go Online|play Go online]]. There is also a growing community of people who write Go software programs, with regular competitions and tournaments between the various Go-playing engines. See [[Computer Go/How Do I Find Other Programs To Play Against?|How Do I Find Other Programs To Play Against?]]

==Where Do I Start?==
The best place to start is with the [http://senseis.xmp.net/?RulesOfGoIntroductory rules of Go]. Once you are comfortable with the rules, you may want to [[Computer Go/Playing Go Online|play a few games]] yourself. At that point you can begin with whichever chapter of this book you find most interesting:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Please do not blank pages ==
I noticed your recent work at [[Modern Greek/Contents]]. Everything seems good, except that while you were merging, you made three pages blank: [[Greek: Introduction]], [[Greek: Alphabet]], and [[Greek: Phonology]].

When you make a blank page, what happens is that there are still links at Wikibooks and the Internet. Some readers will use these links, and instead of finding the [[Modern Greek/Contents]] page where you did all the work, they will find useless blank pages. Thus '''please do not make blank pages''' because they will stop some readers from reading what you worked on!

The good news is that ''I was able to fix'' the blank pages by changing them into redirects. Briefly, you can redirect one page to another by replacing the page with one line like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
#redirect [[Modern Greek/Contents]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

It helped much that you had typed a &quot;summary&quot; (in the box just above the &quot;Save page&quot; button) each time that you blanked a page, explaining that you were merging. From there, I knew that you were not deleting content, and was able to make the redirects. Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks, and I hope that you continue to work at Wikibooks and provide a &quot;summary&quot; with your edits. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:25, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== Modern Greek Module ==

I am just writing to thank you for all the hard work you have put into the Modern Greek Wikibook. I have been trying to teach myself Greek on the internet and this wikibook is by far the best option available. Thankyou for building the book into what it now is, mainly without help. Cheers again!

== Replacing the Recordings ==

I also wanted to say thanks! I am also learning modern greek.  My boyfriend is Greek, and I was wondering if it would be helpful to replace the recordings with his voice?  I'm sure he could find the time to do it.  But I have never added anything to a wiki before, are there guidelines for how to do the reading, recording formats, etc?

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Bcrowell. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Bcrowell~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The command shell==
Ratpoison has a built-in &quot;run&quot; dialog, a quick way to launch any program without having to start a console. Type C-t ! to get a little command box from which you can launch your program. This is most useful for launching graphical applications without tying up a console, as you won't be able to see any of the output of any purely command line programs.

From the same command prompt you can invoke the ratpoison command to tweak settings and do various actions. All these commands can be looked up in the mainpage, and they are all preceded by ratpoison -c. 

For example, to set the &quot;rudeness level&quot; to five (will be explained soon) you type ratpoison -c rudeness 5.

All these commands can of course be executed from within a console window; C-t ! is simply a more convenient variant of a command shell.

===Aliasing===
As mentioned before, ratpoison can be thought of as GNU Screen for window managing; like command line shells, it is possible to alias long commands to shorter versions. 

This can be done through the extended command ability (which resembles C-t !), which is invoked via &quot;C-t :&quot;. This opens a little box just like C-t ! does, but instead of executing shell commands, the input will be sent to ratpoison which will attempt to interpret this input as a ratpoison command; suppose one often runs Mozilla Firefox, but one grew weary of always opening a shell with C-t c and then typing in &quot;mozilla-firefox &amp;&quot; (the ampersand is necessary so you can use the terminal for other things, otherwise the terminal will simply display any error or informative messages Firefox emits), or &quot;C-t ! mozilla-firefox&quot;? 

One could decide to use a shorter name- input C-t :, and enter in &quot;alias firefox exec mozilla-firefox&quot;, which would allow one to simply C-t: firefox, and Firefox would open up; one could even go C-t: &quot;alias f exec mozilla-firefox&quot; if they were rather lazy, and used no other programs beginning with the letter &quot;f&quot;.

Aliasing is not limited to regular program names- if one drops the &quot;exec&quot;, one could alias the command &quot;quit&quot; to &quot;q&quot;: &quot;C-t : alias q quit&quot;.

As a matter of fact, all the keyboard shortcuts one has learned for ratpoison, like C-t p, they all are actually aliases for longer commands! C-t q (which quits ratpoison) is actually an alias for C-t : quit.  This is another area of borrowing from Emacs- Emacs similarly represents all keys on a keyboard and all combinations thereof, as aliases of Emacs functions.

(In these examples the command &quot;exec&quot; is necessary to have ratpoison evaluate the succeeding string as a shell command, and not another ratpoison command. Please see the [http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/doc/Other-Commands.html#index-exec-99 official documentation] on exec for more details; exec essentially does the same thing as C-t !).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Writing a Go GUI can have many different purposes. It can be a front-end to a Go engine so you can see the computer's play in a graphical manner; it can be an SGF viewer to allow a user to review games; it can be an SGF editor to allow users to create SGF files of their own; it can be used as part of a client application to allow users to play Go over the Internet.

This section primarily contains resources for widget libraries intended to make writing a Go GUI easier. However, when writing a Go GUI, even just a simple game viewer, there are other problems to take into account that are primarily detailed in other sections:

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Deostroll. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Deostroll~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Structural Engineering ==
&lt;p&gt;Structural engineering is a vast subject. It concerns other branches of engineering too. Even aeronautical degree programmes do study simple statics and bending of beams, torsion, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suppose the best way to start this module is to describe in vague what structural engineering is and what is a structural engineer's duty/responsibility. And then we can move on to basic mechanics and so on...&lt;/p&gt;
:--[[User:Deostroll|deostroll]] 06:58, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

== About the first edit... ==

:I left the matter refering to concrete as such. May be it should serve other people who wish edit as a reminder about what this subject ought to describe in the future versions. Concrete is only one part of structural engineering! Meanwhile anyone is welcomed to edit this module themselves or suggest how this module should actually go about this subject.
:
:I would also like people to consider following questions (because even I doubt them)
::* Can a bridge be considered as a structural system?
::* Is it correct to say that strucutral engineering activites consists of analysis and design?
::* How should this article/module touch subjects like strucutral analysis and design? Shouldn't they be separate modules?
--[[User:Deostroll|deostroll]] 08:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

It would be better if you add diagrams and drawings for clearing the subjects.  And do you consider clarifying what is &quot;statically determinate structure&quot;?

== Structual analysis and design ==

There is no design without structural analysis.  However I think they are two different subjects... I'm not sure why they have a category with both.  (see structural analysis and design)

== On the definition of structural engineering ==

The quote &quot;Structural Engineering is the art of moulding materials we do not wholly understand into shapes we cannot precisely analyze, so as to withstand forces we cannot really assess, in such a way that the community at large has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance&quot; is incorrectly attributed to James E. Amrhein. Amrhein himself has confirmed that he frequently uses the quote, but is not the original author (see January 2009 issue of STRUCTURE Magazine). This quote is a slight revision from the definition in the 1967 textbook ''Structural Analysis Volume One'' by Dr. E.H. Brown. Brown's definition was &quot;The art of moulding materials we do not really understand into shapes we cannot really analyze, so as to withstand forces we cannot really assess, in such a way that the public does not really suspect.&quot; Mr. Amrhein is not even responsible for making the modification to its longer and less repetitive form; that credit probably belongs to Dr. A.R. Dykes (see May 1978 issue of The Structural Engineer).</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsection (1) provides that a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|non-UK resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|company]] is only within the charge to corporation tax if it carries on a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Trade|trade]] in the United Kingdom through a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Permanent establishment|permanent establishment]] in the United Kingdom. This does not necessarily mean that a non-UK resident company that is not carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment is not subject to UK taxation on its profits, as it may well fall within the charge to income tax. This is typically the case for non-UK resident companies that receive income from UK land, where income less expenses is charged to income tax at the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Basic rate|basic rate]] (22% in 2005-06). The precise meaning of &quot;non-UK resident&quot;, &quot;carrying on a trade&quot; &quot;in&quot; (the United Kingdom) and &quot;permanent establishment&quot; are all important in deciding whether a foreign company is within the charge to corporation tax, and if so, to what extent.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2) provides that a non-UK resident company within the charge to corporation tax is charged to corporation tax only on its profits, wherever arising, that are attributable to the permanent establishment.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (2A) provides a list of which profits are attributable to a permanent establishment, namely:
*trading income arising directly or indirectly through or from the establishment
*income from property or rights used by, or held by or for, the establishment, and;
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Chargeable gain|chargeable gains]] failing within [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 10B of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992|Section 10B of TCGA]] (i) by virtue of assets being used or held for the purposes of the trade carried on by the company through the establishment, or (ii) by virtue of assets being used or held for the purposes of the establishment or being acquired for use by or for the purposes of the establishment.

In practice, deciding what this amounts to can be difficult, particularly in the financial services industry, where funds held overseas may be supporting business arising from a UK permanent establishment. This Subsection is therefore supplemented by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11AA]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule A1 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A1]]. Life insurance companies have their own rules set out in Sections 11A to 11C of ICTA (as deemed to be inserted by Schedule 19AC to ICTA).&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3) mimics the provision in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 7 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 7]] that applies to UK resident companies. It provides that where a non-UK resident company to which this Section applies has received income under deduction of income tax, and it brings that income into its corporation tax computation, the income tax suffered may be used to offset the corporation tax charge for the period in which that income is brought into the corporation tax computation.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) disapplies subsection (3) for a payment of loan interest to which [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 369 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 369 of ICTA]] applies. Section 369 deals with mortgage relief at source. As mortgage relief at source no longer applies, this subsection no longer has any practical effect. This Subsection mimics Section 7(3).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Company''' is defined for the purposes of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 832 of ICTA]] as:

*any body corporate or unincorporated association but does not include a partnership, a local authority or a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Local authority association|local authority association]]

However, this definition is subject to [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 468 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 468 of ICTA]] and does not apply to the following provisions of ICTA:

#Chapter 1 of Part XVII (Cancellation of tax advantages from certain transactions in securities)
#Sections 774 to 777
#Section 839 (Connected persons)
#Paragraph 15 of Schedule 3 (which has now been repealed)

Nor does it apply where the context requires otherwise because some other definition of &quot;company&quot; applies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Section sets out Schedule A, the charge to tax arising from income on UK land.

==The charge to tax==

Subsection (1) sets out the four paragraphs of the charge.

Paragraph 1 raises the charge on &quot;the annual profits arising from a business carried on for exploitation, as a source of rents of other receipts, of any estate, interest or rights in or over land in the United Kingdom. To the extent a transaction is entered into for such exploitation it is treated as being entered into in the course of such a business. All such property businesses and transactions by a person are treated as if it is one business being carried on. There are two exceptions for this: first in respect of non-resident companies (see Subsection (1A)) below; second in respect of life [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Insurance company|insurance companies]], where there is a separate rule in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 432AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Sections 432AA]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 441B of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|441B(2A)]] of ICTA.&lt;br&gt;

Paragraph 2 carves out certain items from the charge to Schedule A:

*Profits arising from the occupation of land;
*Profits charged to tax under Case I of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 53 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 53(1) of ICTA]] (farming and marketing gardening) or [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 55 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 55 of ICTA]] (mines, quarries and other concerns);
*Receipts or expenses taken into account in the taxation of tied premises (under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 98 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1998|Section 98 of ICTA]]);
*Rent taxed under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 119 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 119 of ICTA]] (rent, etc. payable in connection with mines, quarries and other concerns) or under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 120 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 120(1) of ICTA]] (certain rent, etc. payable in respect of electric line wayleaves);
*Credits and debits arising from [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/loan relationships|loan relationships]] or [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/derivative contracts|derivative contracts]].&lt;br&gt;

Paragraph 3 deems rights in static [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Caravan|caravans]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Houseboat|houseboats]] to be rights in UK land for the purposes of Schedule A.&lt;br&gt;

Paragraph 4 brings income receipts or other consideration received from the provision of furniture in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Furnished lettings|furnished lettings]] into Schedule A, unless the receipts are charged under Case I of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] as receipts of a furniture letting trade.

==Other Subsections==

Subsection (1A) provides that for [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|non-UK resident]] [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Company|companies]], businesses carried on and transactions entered into by it, the profits on which are within the corporation tax charge, are charged to corporation tax under Schedule A. However, a UK property business that falls to be within the charge to income tax is charged to income tax under Chapter 3 of Part 3 of ITTOIA. If a non-resident company has some property business within the charge to corporation tax, and some within the charge to income tax, it is treated as though it has two separate property businesses.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (3A) provides that Subsection (1) applies for corporation tax purposes, but not for income tax purposes (except insofar as it is necessary for them to apply for income tax purposes to ensure the application of Subsection (1) for corporation tax purposes.&lt;br&gt;

Subsection (4) Notes that Part II of ICTA contains more information on the charge to Schedule A for corporation tax purposes, and that Part II of ICTA also contains more information on the income tax charge to profits on a property business under Chapter 3 of Part 3 of ITTOIA (which doesn't apply to entities within the charge to corporation tax).

== Overview ==

== Infinitives ==

See the verbs infinitive mood.

===A short syntax===

An infinitive can be joined to every part of speech: a noun, as &quot;Obtain felicity,&quot; an adjective, as &quot;Desirous to speak,&quot; a pronoun, as &quot;What to accuse,&quot; a finite verb, as &quot;Come to seek,&quot; an infinitive, as &quot;To wait to consider,&quot; a participle, as &quot;Bent to unhoard,&quot; an adverb, as &quot;How to act,&quot; a conjunction, as &quot;More than praise it,&quot; a preposition, as &quot;About to write,&quot; and an interjection, as &quot;O to forget her!&quot;.

An infinitive may stand for the following: a supplement to verb, as &quot;Go to seek,&quot; purpose, as &quot;Labour not to be rich,&quot; an object of passion, as &quot;He loves to ride,&quot; a cause of passion, as &quot;I rejoice to hear it,&quot; the subject of proposition, as &quot;To steal is sinful,&quot; the object of proposition, as &quot;To enjoy is to obey,&quot; a coming event, as &quot;Things to come,&quot; a necessary event, as &quot;It is to be remembered,&quot; something previously suggested, as &quot;The gift to know it,&quot; and measure, as &quot;Enough to show.&quot;

== Gerunds ==

Gerunds are nouns built from a verb with an ''ing'' suffix. They can be used as the subject of a sentence, an object, or an object of preposition. They can also be used to complement a subject. Often, gerunds exist side-by-side with nouns that come from the same root but the gerund and the common noun have different shades of meaning. Examples: breath and ''breathing'', knowledge and ''knowing''. Yet, distinguishing between a gerund, and a verb can sometimes cause trouble. For example:

*&quot;''Swimming'' has to be the best sport ever.&quot; (''Swimming'' is gerund.)
*&quot;I went swimming today.&quot; (Not a Gerund, because it is not an idea.)

Examples of gerunds as the subject of a sentence are:

*&quot;''Backpacking'' is a rewarding pastime.&quot;
*&quot;''Stretching'' can loosen up muscles.&quot;
*&quot;No ''smoking''.&quot; (I.e., no smoking is allowed / you may not smoke here.)

As an object:
*&quot;We all love to go ''bowling'' on the weekend.&quot;
*&quot;He loves ''eating'' chips.&quot;

An object of preposition:

*&quot;They complained of ''hearing'' strange sounds from the next cabin.&quot;
*&quot;They sang about ''being'' eaten by bears to allay their fears.&quot;

And as a complement to a subject:

*&quot;One of the most dangerous things to do on the lake is ''ice-skating''.&quot;

== Participles ==

'''Participles''' are forms of verbs which are used as adjectives. A participle is a word derived from a verb, participating the properties of a verb, and of an adjective or a noun; and is generally formed by adding ''ing'', ''d'', or ''ed'', to the verb: thus, from the verb rule, are formed three participles, two simple and one compound; as, ''ruling, ruled, having ruled''.

English verbs, not defective, have severally three participles; which have been very variously denominated, perhaps the most accurately thus: the present, the past, and the past perfect. Or, as their order is undisputed, they may be conveniently called the first, the second, and the third.

The '''present participle''' is that which ends commonly in ''ing'', and implies a continuance of the being, action, or passion: as, ''being, acting, ruling, loving, defending, terminating''. Therefore:

*''Talk'' becomes ''talking''
*''Jump'' becomes ''jumping''
*''Open'' becomes ''opening''
*''See'' becomes ''seeing''

The present participle, when simple, is always formed by adding ''ing'', or it is formed by prefixing being to some other simple participle; as, ''being reading, being read, being completed''.

The '''past participle''' is that which ends commonly in ''ed'' or ''en'', and implies a completion of the being, action, or passion: as, ''been, acted, ruled, loved, defended, terminated''. Therefore:

*''Talk'' becomes ''talked''
*''Jump'' becomes ''jumped''
*''Open'' becomes ''opened''
*However, ''See'' becomes ''seen''

The past participle is always simple, and is regularly formed by adding ''d'' or ''ed'' to the radical verb: those verbs from which it is formed otherwise, are either irregular or redundant.

The irregular verb ''see'' also did not have a regular past participle. As with most irregular words, there is no good &quot;general rule&quot; which applies, but often ''ed'' is replaced by 'en'. More irregular verbs with irregular past participles are:

*''Be'', ''been''
*''Break'', ''broken''
*''Eat'', ''eaten''
*''Slide'', ''slid''

The '''past perfect participle''' is that which takes the sign having, and implies a previous completion of the being, action, or passion: as, ''having loved, having seen, having written; having been loved, having been writing, having been written''.

The past perfect participle is always compound, and is formed by prefixing having to the past participle, when the compound is double, and having been to the past or the present participle, when the compound is triple: as, having spoken, having been spoken, having been speaking.

===A short syntax===

Participles relate to nouns or pronouns, as &quot;Reading Plato,&quot;
except the following cases: the preceding phrase, as &quot;To leave them, appearing a duty,&quot; an abstract action or being, as &quot;To seem compelled, is disagreeable,&quot; substitute for infinitive, as &quot;Afraid of trying,&quot; and substitute for a noun, as &quot;This is talking.&quot;

==Examples==

*He is '''talking''' to her.
*They are '''jumping''' into the pool.
*We had '''eaten''' the pie.
Each of these cases has a verb acting as an adjective, describing the subject.

In case you were wondering, ''had'' plus a past participle is called a '''past perfect''', or in the United Kingdom, the '''pluperfect'''.

== Establishing ICT training needs for individuals or groups ==
=== Training needs analysis ===

Before embarking on designing and delivering any training programme you must establish your precise objectives. This means determining:

*1.	the '''existing''' skills, knowledge and competences of each of the learners

*2.	the skills, knowledge and competences the learners '''require''' in order to operate effectively in their existing work role or to progress to a different work role

*3.	And, from 1 and 2, the '''gap''' in skills, knowledge and competence which the training is designed to address.

It will be the objective of your training that each participant learns enough to eliminate this gap.

This process is often called a '''Training Needs Analysis (TNA)''' or '''Learning Needs Analysis (LNA)'''.  For Outcome 1 you must demonstrate that you can carry out a straightforward TNA for individuals and groups of learners. 

The first step then is to make an '''accurate estimate''' of the learner’s current competence.

 	
----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, outline what may happen if you embark on delivering training without ascertaining the existing skills, knowledge and competence of your learners.

----

 

==== TNA problems ====

There are two equally damaging scenarios. 

At one extreme you may have '''overestimated''' the learners’ skills and knowledge.  You therefore pitch your training at too high a level.  If you are lucky, the learners will point this out to you and you may be able to think on your feet and do a quick redesign of the training. 

However, if you find yourself having to devote a considerable amount of time to bringing the learners’ skills and knowledge up to the point at which you thought you would be starting from, you will be unlikely to be able to achieve the final learning objectives in the original timescale.  

If you have overestimated the skills of only one or two members of a learning group, it is quite likely that they will not draw your attention to this.  Instead they will sit quietly, not wishing to appear foolish in front of their colleagues.  In this situation they will learn little and will become demotivated and disinterested.

At the other extreme you may have '''underestimated''' the learners’ skills and knowledge.  You will then find yourself delivering training which covers areas which they already know – “teaching Granny to suck eggs”.  

Your learners are likely to become quickly '''disenchanted''' and possibly aggressive.  If this applies to only one or two in a learning group, these learners are likely to switch off and may distract other group members.

From these examples, you can see the importance of really knowing your learners before you start.

 

==== Estimating ICT Competence ====

Learners may have acquired differing '''levels''' of ICT competence through:

*	'''formal training''' in the workplace
*	'''experience''' in the workplace
*	'''off-the-job training''' such as an ICT course at school or college
*	'''personal development''' and experience outside work.

Where skills and knowledge come from non-workplace environments, it is important to make sure that they are transferable into a workplace setting.  ICT skills and knowledge usually do transfer readily.  Thus your TNA should relate to competences from both work and non-work environments.

The obvious place to start is with the learners themselves. However, people are, depending on their personality, often inclined to underplay or alternatively exaggerate their ICT competence and experience.  So you will wish to '''corroborate''' the learner’s estimates of their competence through hard evidence or the views of other people.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, think of who else, apart from the learners themselves, might be able to provide you with useful information on a learner’s ICT competence.

----

 

==== Sources of information regarding ICT competence ====

You might usefully consult some or all of the learner’s:

*	'''line manager''' or immediate supervisor
*	'''colleagues'''
*	'''previous tutors''' or trainers from within and outside your own organisation
*	'''clients''' in the library who will have received a service from the learner which is ICT related.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down as many techniques as you can which you might use to gather information on the learner’s competence from the learner themselves or from any or all of the people listed above.

----

==== Information gathering techniques ====

You might use some or all of:

*	direct observation of the learner using ICT in the workplace
*	examination of work samples or work records belonging to the learner
*	practical tests and assessments of the learner’s use of ICT
*	questionnaires or checklists covering key ICT competences
*	the learner’s staff appraisal reports
*	interviews or focus groups with learner, manager, colleagues, tutors, clients

 

==== Direct Observation ====

This is one of the most reliable methods for you to gauge the learner’s competence.  You will see for yourself exactly what they can and cannot do.  You can supplement this by '''questioning''' to extend to situations which occur rarely or would be emergencies.  Use questions like &quot;What would you do if the system crashed at this point?” or “Can you think of an occasion when what you have just done would not be appropriate?”

There are a few '''disadvantages''' with direct observation.  The learner may feel nervous and so under-perform.  Alternatively, they may “play to the camera”, although this is usually easily spotted.  The main drawback is that observation must be done on a one-to-one basis.  It is therefore time-consuming.  Another difficulty can be that you have to arrange a time which is convenient to both you and the learner and when work conditions allow the learner to carry out the specified tasks.

 

==== Examination of Work Products ====

ICT tasks often produce '''printed materials''' or '''electronic records''' which are stored in the computer.  These demonstrate clearly what a learner has been capable of.

 

==== Practical Tests and Assessments ====

You may be able to devise a short pre-training assessment which all learners will undertake. Make sure that this assesses only the knowledge and skills which are directly relevant to the proposed training (and, it goes without saying, to the work to which this training is related). 

Devising assessment material is a skilled task.  It is always advantageous to have a dummy run with a couple of volunteers who will give you unbiased feedback and point out any ambiguities or deficiencies in the assessment.  You may be able to get assistance in devising assessment materials from your Training or HR Department. 

 
==== Questionnaires or Checklists ====

Questionnaires or checklists can be completed by the learner themselves or by other people who can give an '''informed opinion''' as to the learner’s competence.  It is important not to make these too detailed.  You should home in on the key competences only. 

Here’s an example of a checklist which might be used to establish a learner’s competence in using applications under Microsoft Windows.

Please tick the box which best describes your ability to carry out each of the tasks below:

{| style=&quot;width:50%; height:200px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:100px&quot;

| &amp;nbsp;
|}

==== Staff Appraisal Reports  ====

Staff appraisal documents are, of course, '''confidential'''.  However, with the agreement of the member of staff concerned you may be shown relevant extracts relating to ICT skills.

 

==== Interviews or Focus Groups  ====

These an take place with learners, managers, colleagues tutors or clients and may be one-to-one or group interviews.  It is vital to obtain the consent of the learner before you invite opinions from others as to the learner’s ICT competence.  It is equally important to reassure others that the learner has agreed to your interview with them.  In some cases the learner may be able to suggest appropriate interviewees who could provide valuable insight into their ICT competence.

In all cases it is essential to start the interview by explaining the reasons why you are exploring the learner’s ICT competence.  It is good practice to use a checklist to ensure that you get all the required information from each interviewee.

==== Areas of competence ====

You can use these techniques to profile the learner’s '''existing ICT''' skills in the areas of:

*	hardware
*	operating system environment (e.g.: Windows)
*	packages used (e.g.: Word)
*	the library’s own ICT management system
*	the Internet

In Outcome 1 of Unit 3 we discussed in some detail the areas which you would want to explore under each of these headings.  If you want to review this material, you can click the ICTL logo near the top left of the page to return to the Unit 7 home page and navigate to the relevant Outcome from there.

 

==== Learning objectives ====

The next stage is to determine your learning objectives, i.e.: the skills and knowledge which it is intended all learners should possess at the end of the training.  These will usually be related to: 

*	improving the learners’ '''competence in their current job'''
*	preparing for planned '''new ICT devleopments''' which will impinge on the learners’ current job
*	upskilling so that the learners can move on to a different job which requires '''increased ICT competence.'''

To determine the required skills and knowledge, you can use the same or modifications of the methods for assessing existing ICT competence

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, look at this list again: 

*	direct observation of learner using ICT in the workplace
*	examination of work samples or work records belonging to the learner
*	practical tests and assessments of the learner’s use of ICT
*	questionnaires or checklists covering key ICT competences
*	the learner’s staff appraisal reports·	interviews with learner, manager, colleagues, tutors, clients

Remembering that this time you are focusing on the end product of the training, amend the list to show the methods you could employ.

----

 

==== Methods of gathering information ====

We think that this time you will lay more emphasis than previously on evidence from people other than the learner.  Of course, it is still important to consult the learner in order to gain their views on the skills which they think they require.  However, at this stage you are likely also to consider:

*	'''direct observation''' of others using ICT in the workplace, e.g.: staff already employed in a post to which the learner may aspire
*	'''examination of work samples or work records''' belonging to others, e.g.: a colleague in a similar job to the learner who demonstrates greater ICT competence
*	'''questionnaires or checklist'''s covering key ICT competences, e.g.: completed by managerial or supervisory staff
*	'''interviews''' with managers, supervisors and colleagues in similar posts or in promoted posts
*	'''literature''' provided by suppliers of new/upgraded ICT equipment which it is intended to install in the library.

And finally having gathered all your evidence as to the existing skills and knowledge of your learners and the competence which are the end result of the training, you can design an appropriate training programme to upskill the learners to the required level.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, consider what approach you might adopt if your training needs analysis establishes that the ICT skills of your small group of learners differ considerably.  

----

 

==== Dealing with differing skill levels ====

Your approach might be to design '''individual learning programmes''' for each learner which they can work through independently of their colleagues. 

However, it is probably more cost-effective to bring the skills of all group members up to a common base level and then provide group training from that point on.  You might, for instance, arrange for three of the group to work through some basic ICT learning packages in the library before you delivered some group sessions on simple Internet searching.

== Selecting a delivery approach ==
=== Learning styles ===

We all learn in a variety of ways but each of us tends to have one learning style with which we feel most comfortable.  Many educational theorists have written about learning styles and the implications of these for delivery of training.  One well-accepted approach is that of '''Honey and Mumford''' who identified four main learning styles:

*	activists
*	reflectors
*	theorists
*	pragmatists

According to Honey and Mumford, different learning activities are associated with each of the four learning styles.

 

==== Activists ====

Activists prefer '''new experiences, opportunities to tackle problems''' and '''difficult tasks'''.  They like challenges, generating new ideas, brain storming, leading others. Their philosophy is: &quot;I'll try anything once&quot;. 

They tend to act first and consider the consequences afterwards. They are gregarious and like learning in a group with other people, although they can tend to try to centre all such group activities on themselves.

 

==== Reflectors ====

Reflectors are thoughtful people who prefer to '''collect all the facts''' and data and '''consider every aspect''' of a situation before taking action. 

They will listen to others’ opinions and experiences and learn from these. They are likely to adopt a low profile in group discussions but enjoy observing other people in action. 

 

==== Theorists ====

Theorists prefer a '''clear structure, focus and purpose''' and will want to know exactly what is expected of them. They like to have time to '''think logically''' about ideas and situations and try to fit these into a pattern. 

They learn by thinking problems through in a step-by-step, logical way. They like to analyse and synthesise. They are uncomfortable with subjective judgements, lateral thinking and anything flippant. They are happy to learn alone without group support. 

 

==== Pragmatists ====

Pragmatists learn best through '''concrete activities''' which let them try out ideas, theories and techniques. They like to have the opportunity to '''practice''' what they are learning with '''feedback''' from a knowledgeable mentor. 

As they are essentially practical, down to earth people who like making practical decisions and solving problems, they tend to dislike long-winded and open-ended discussions. 

Although each learner is likely to have one preferred learning style, everyone can use a '''mixture of styles''', depending on the type of learning and the occasion.  

QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Different Learning Implications

 

==== Other approaches to learning styles ====

The approach of '''Honey and Mumford''' is just one way of looking at different learning styles. If you wish to explore this further, you will find some good summaries of other approaches at: http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/experience.htm

Another way of categorising learners is to measure their attributes in terms of:

*1.	Active vs reflective
*2.	Sensing vs intuitive
*3.	Visual vs verbal
*4.	Sequential vs global.

You can learn more about these learning styles and their implications for design and delivery of training at: http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html 

This also includes a '''short online questionnaire''' which you can be used to determine your own learning style.
 
That's the end of this section. You can review any topic by using the menu at the left-hand side of the screen, or move on to the next section: Delivery approaches …

=== Delivery approaches ===

When we explored the four different learning styles, we realised that the trainer must chose '''appropriate delivery methods''' in order to accommodate the styles of the learners. 

Another equally important dimension to consider is matching the delivery method to the nature and content of the learning.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, list the most common types of delivery method which you might be able to include in a programme of workplace training.

----

 

==== Delivery methods ====

Among the most common delivery methods are:

*	“chalk and talk”
*	demonstration
*	group problem solving
*	role playing and simulations
*	practical activities, individually and in groups
*	individualised learning,  e.g. from a book or an e-learning package
*	videos and other media.

==== “Chalk and Talk” ====

This phrase is often used to describe '''traditional teaching'''. The picture it conjures up is of the trainer in front of the group of learners, giving a talk on some topic. Nowadays, the “chalk” element is more likely to be a whiteboard, flipchart or a PowerPoint computerised presentation. This method is suitable where the trainer wishes to impart theoretical knowledge to the whole group of learners. 

We absorb more information from '''what we see''' than from what we hear. So it makes sense always to include visuals, either on the board, chart or screen or through handouts or posters.  The learners’ '''attention span''' will be limited when they are required only to listen to someone talking. Good practice is to introduce a variation by asking questions of the learners, encouraging the learners to ask questions of you or by interspersing your talk with group discussions.

==== Demonstration ====

The trainer will demonstrate '''how to carry out a practical activity''' to either a group of learners or to an individual. You might be able to incorporate demonstrations from other people – experienced colleagues or one of the group who is more skilled than the others. 

When group demonstrations are involved, it is crucial that every group member can observe the demonstration clearly and has the opportunity to ask questions of the demonstrator.

==== Group Problem Solving ====

'''Team working''' is one of the most highly prized skills in the workforce of today. Any training which involves group problem solving has the multiple advantage of:

*	improving the learners team working skills
*	developing the particular competences related to the training topic
*	enhancing the core problems solving skills of the learners.

Problem solving activities need to be carefully structured by the trainer. A useful approach is to encourage the learners to adopt a process of Plan–Do–Review. This ensures that they progress to the stage of evaluating their problem solving strategy and learning from it: not just designing and implementing a strategy for solving the problem.

 

==== Role Playing and Simulations ====

These offer the opportunity for participants to practice in a safe environment and to learn about situations which occur only rarely or which involve danger and emergency action. 

However, role-playing and simulations should be used sensitively, remembering that many learners feel apprehensive in artificially constructed situations.

 

==== Practical Activities ====

'''Hands-on practical work''' has an important role to play in workplace learning. It offers the learners the opportunity to develop skills in a real situation, with the equipment they will actually use on the job. Do make sure that there is enough equipment. 

In particular, it is unwise to double learners up on terminals to undertake computer-related tasks. This usually results in one (the more confident) learner carrying out all the tasks, while their partner passively watches.

 

==== Individualised Learning ====

You may have access to commercially produced learning packages (print or electronic) which are applicable to the training you wish to deliver. The alternative is to design your own – but be warned - this requires '''considerable skill''' and '''time input''' on the part of the trainer, if a polished and professional product is to result.

 

==== Videos and other media ====

It is common to use audio or video material in learning sessions. These provide the opportunity to engage the learner by introducing experiences from beyond the training room or the library service.  And they can provide a welcome change from the trainer’s voice!

=== Motivating learners ===

Motivation is the key to all successful learning. You may have designed a wonderful training programme but if the learners are not motivated to learn, your efforts are doomed to failure.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, make a list of factors which can demotivate learners

----
 

==== Demotivating learners ====

We could demotivate you by giving a long list here! But instead here is a summary of what we think are the '''main demotivators''' for learners.

'''The training itself:'''

*	The training is at too high or low a level.

*	Learners have been compelled to attend the training without the reasons for their participation being adequately explained.

*	The topic appears irrelevant to the learners.

*	The trainer has not outlined clearly at the start of the training what the '''specific learning objectives''' are.

*	The training is '''delivered badly.'''

*	The '''learning environment''' is poor.

'''The learner:'''

*	Learners have had previous '''negative experiences''' at school, college or of workplace training.

*	Learners are '''distracted''' by problems unconnected with the learning.

==== Level of training ====

If the training is pitched at the '''wrong level''', it will result in learners who are either '''struggling to cope''' or '''bored'''. Neither category of learner will be particularly motivated to learn. If you have carried out the training needs assessment properly, this should simply not occur. 

Learners for whom the training would have been at too high a level should have received preparatory training to upskill them and extend their knowledge to the competence required. 

Learners for whom the training would be at too low a level should either simply not attend or could be slotted in part way through the programme at the point at which the learning becomes relevant to them.

 

==== Other demotivating factors ====

We will group the next three points together as they are closely linked.

*	Learners have been compelled to attend the training without the '''reasons''' for their participation being adequately explained.

*	The topic appears '''irrelevant''' to the learners.

*	The trainer has not outlined clearly at the start of the training what the '''specific learning objectives''' are.

We take it as read that the topic is relevant to the learners - otherwise there is no justification for you to deliver the training. 

Reasons for attendance should be clearly explained to the learners in advance and links between the proposed training and their work demonstrated. It is especially important to outline the benefits to the learners themselves (as opposed to the library service) which will result from the training programme. You might be able to show, for instance, how learning to use a new computer program could cut down on boring, repetitive manual tasks. As the trainer you may either discuss these issues yourself with the learners in advance of the training or, alternatively, you should ensure that another person does so, most probably their line manager. In the later case you may find it helpful to construct a briefing sheet.

At the start of the training programme you will outline your specific learning objectives and how you intend to deliver the training to achieve these. At this point you should clarify what your expectations of the learners are and, conversely, what support the learners can expect from you.

 

==== Badly delivered training ====

We hope that when you have completed this unit, this will not be the case! However, let us list a few common pitfalls which you should try to avoid.

*	Trying to pack '''too much material''' into a learning session

*	Poorly produced '''visuals'''

*	Irritating '''mannerisms''' on the part of the trainer, e.g.: jingling coins in pocket, fiddling with jewellery

*	'''Poor delivery''', e.g.: mumbling, speaking too quickly

*	'''Lack of variation''' of learning activities

*	'''Poorly structured learning programme''', e.g.: no logical flow through content (See Outcome 3)

*	Trainer does not have '''sufficient knowledge''' or skills in topic

 

==== Poor learning environment ====

We are using the term “learning environment” to encompass the '''venue''', '''the equipment''', the '''resources''' etc. You should make sure that any practical issues which might demotivate the learner are minimised. 

Examples might be too high or too low temperatures in the training room, training sessions which start late or over-run, extraneous noise or distractions, technical problems with ICT equipment, interruptions from colleagues seeking information on day-to-day work. And do make sure that all mobile phones are switched off before the training commences.

==== Previous negative experiences ====

Obviously establishing a friendly, reassuring '''relationship''' with the learner is crucial here. It may also be helpful to expand on the differences between the current training programme and any previous negative experiences which the learner has had. You could emphasise for instance that your learners will be able to work at their own pace, can practice what they are learning in the workplace with support from more experienced colleagues, will not have to sit formal examinations or test etc.

One major motivator is for the learner to see that they have achieved something. Success breeds success. The implication of this for you as the trainer is that learning programmes must be broken down into small sections and the objective and sub-objectives for each section should be clearly explained to your learners. For instance, if the training relates to word processing, a sub-objective might be for the learner to become competent in left, right and full justification of text.

 

==== Distractions ====

If a learner is worried about '''personal problems''', they will be unable to give their full attention to learning new things. This is possibly the most difficult demotivator for a trainer to tackle. After all, you can do little if one of your learners is experiencing financial difficulties, marital problems or is concerned about their health. All you can do in these circumstances is to reassure the learner that you are sympathetic to any difficulties which they have shared with you and that you will attempt to accommodate any special requests resulting from them.

You may be able to take some action about more practical problems though. An example would be if the training occurs at the venue which is not the learner’s normal workplace, resulting in childcare problems because of long journeys by public transport. By allowing such a learner to leave ten minutes earlier, you might be able to resolve the situation.

If you wish to read more about the theory of motivation and its application to training, you will find a good summary at http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/motivation.htm

== Design of learning materials and programmes on ICT related topics ==
=== Defining learning objectives ===

You should define learning objectives in '''specific terms'''. Learning objectives usually involve a statement of:

*	'''the task or knowledge''' involved, i.e.: what must the learner be able to do or know? E.g.: save data in a spreadsheet
*	'''the condition,'''  i.e.: how will it be performed? E.g.: without reference to the Help facility
*	'''the standard,''' i.e.: how well must it be performed? E.g.: correctly in 90% of cases

It is generally accepted that all learning objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timebound.) You can find more information about this at http://explearning.ucf.edu/registered-students/tips-for-success/writing-smart-learning-objectives/195 

You can find useful guides to writing learning objectives at the following locations:

==== Bloom's Taxonomy  ====

You may find it useful to investigate Bloom’s Taxonomy as a framework for writing learning objectives. In 1956 Benjamin Bloom wrote a book entitled “Taxonomy of Educational Objectives” which has been widely adopted within the educational community as the de facto way of classifying '''cognitive competence'''. An updated version of the book, edited by Anderson and Krathwohl was published in 2001. You can easily find it at www.amazon.co.uk and other online bookshops.

Bloom’s Taxonomy is a simple way of categorising cognitive skills. It has six levels:

*1.       knowledge
*2.       comprehension
*3.       application
*4.       analysis
*5.       synthesis
*6.       evaluation.

'''ACTIVITY 3.1'''

Choose a simple task, e.g.: “Using tables in Word” and write learning objectives for it.

(Try to choose a task which is of some relevance to you, or to one of your clients, as we’ll be using it for activities throughout this section.)

----

==== Structuring learning ====

In structuring learning you should take account of the learning cycle. In its simplest (3 stage) form the way in which learning takes place may be expressed as plan, do and review. See http://www.wilderdom.com/experiential/elc/ExperientialLearningCycle.htm for more detail.



or Kolb’s more sophisticated version:

http://www.businessballs.com/kolblearningstyles.htm

==== Learning sequence ====

You should be able to devise a '''logical sequence''' for the learning, taking account of which parts of the learning are a precursor for others, moving from simpler to more complex concepts and grouping related topics together. 

Any session should have a '''beginning''' (where the objectives are clearly stated and agreed by the candidate and the learners), a '''middle''' (where the learning activities are undertaken) and an '''end''' (where the learning is summarised and next steps agreed). 

The learning plan should be made clear to the learners when the learning programme commences. In structuring the learning the candidate should ensure that a variety of '''learning experiences''' are included to prevent tedium from demotivating the learner.

You can find a lot of useful information about '''structuring learning''' from the link below. Although it is specifically aimed at teachers, most of the information given is equally applicable in other learning contexts.

'''ACTIVITY 3.2'''

Draw up a learning plan to allow a specific client to achieve the objectives you listed in the previous activity. Your plan should take account of the client’s preferred learning style. 

----

==== Using ICT to create learning materials ====

Your approach to the use of software to create learning materials will be dependent on the availability of software within your own organisation.  There are several '''courseware creation packages''' available, which can be used.  Although they offer many features to include multimedia etc., the vital advantage is that they provide routing (branching and looping) through the material allowing learners to take their own appropriate path.  They can also provide automated and recorded assessment. 

One easy-to-use package is '''Course Genie''', which lets you create course materials in Word and convert them automatically to HTML. This software has now been superceeded by Wimba Create:

http://www.wimba.com/products/wimba_create

This site also offers extensive demos on the use of the software.

Other examples of content creation software include '''Authorware, Director''' and '''Dreamweaver''' (http://www.macromedia.com) and products such as '''Lectora''' (http://www.lectora.co.uk).  It should be noted that these are complex products and you may require specialised training to achieve maximum benefit.

If specialised software is not available, there are other ICT routes.  Word processing software such as Microsoft Word can be used to author content.  Graphics, animations, videos and sound files can also be included in the document, as well as text.  Animations and sound files will then operate when the document is viewed on a computer.

A more polished package can be created by using presentation software such as '''Microsoft PowerPoint'''.  The greatest advantage is that this will create a page-based approach. Additionally a '''common look''' can be created throughout the whole package. Again, sound or still and moving visual effects can be incorporated.

You should have knowledge of how both specialised and general software can be used to create a learning package and have experience of authoring with either general or specialised software.

You can use a site like: http://www.jiscrsc.ac.uk/scotland which has a range of practical units on making the most of Microsoft software aimed at designing simple learning episodes.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 3.3'''

Use the package of your choice to create a short learning episode designed to meet one of the objectives you outlined earlier.

----

==== Selecting and merging content from internal and external sources ====

You should appreciate that it is not always necessary to produce '''original content''' for learning packages. A wealth of learning material is available through the Internet and much of this is copyright free for educational purposes. You should ensure that any chosen material matches the learning objectives and style of the complete package and that the use which is made of the chosen material is fully compliant with copyright.

You can often find useful materials quickly with a search engine, but you may also like to check some of the following links:

The BBC offers a number of useful online courses on PC-related topics: http://www.bbc.co.uk/learning/onlinecourses/

You can find useful online resources for learning about Microsoft Office products at: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training-FX101782702.aspx

If your library is an SQA centre, you may be able to get access to the '''PC Passport''' materials produced by SQA. You can get more information at: http://www.sqa.org.uk/pcpassport 

If you have access to these materials you can download them in Word format, allowing you to modify them if you wish.

There are also a number of low-cost or open source courseware suppliers. For example, '''[https://moodle.org/ Moodle]''' is open source software widely used by schools, colleges and universities

== Support individuals and groups in their use of learning materials ==
=== Types of support ===

We often see the terms coaching, mentoring and training used in relation to workplace learning.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, can you write down a short definition of each of these terms, as you understand them?

----

 

==== Support roles ====

Although there may be some argument over the precise meaning of these terms, the following definitions bring out the key differences between them.

In '''coaching''', the learner and the coach are active collaborators.  The coach observes the learner in a real, naturally occurring workplace situation as they try to complete tasks.  The coach provides hints, help, and feedback as needed. 

'''Mentoring''' involves a sustained relationship between the learner and the mentor who offers support, guidance, and assistance. 

'''Training''' is more formal learning, and more of a one-way process, where the trainer imparts skills and knowledge to the learner.

 
==== Coaching ====

Coaching was originally used in business to describe support given to people who were seen as under-performing in some way.  Now it is more usually seen as a means of supporting people on the job in order to help them '''improve their competence''' and achieve their maximum potential.  The analogy of the sports coach developing the tennis player to improve their techniques and win more matches may be helpful. 

Coaching is generally considered to be a fairly '''short-term''' activity, related to specific objectives.  It consists of a one-to-one interaction between the coach and the person being coached in a relatively informal setting.  The aim is to provide the learner with feedback in their performance together with suggestions on how to improve from a knowledgeable and skilled person. 

Skilled coaches know when to be '''directive''' and when to be '''passive'''.  They can distinguish between situations when it is appropriate to '''intervene''' to support the learner and when it is more effective to permit independent learning even though this involves the learner making mistakes. 

==== Mentoring ====

Mentoring has become very fashionable in the last few years.  Although mentoring is a relatively widespread practice there is no '''formal definition''' of what mentoring is but, generally speaking, it could be defined as a relationship between two people - the mentee (the person being mentored) and the mentor - which will positively affect the development of at least one of them.  Note the phrase “positively affect the development of at least one of them”.  This recognises the fact that most mentors will say that they too have gained from the experience of mentoring.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 4.1'''

Think of people who have had a significant influence on the development, progression and direction of your career.  You may come up with several. Now identify what they did which influenced you. 

----

 

==== Significant influences ====

You will probably find that the people who have affected your career significantly:

*	Guided you
*	Supported you
*	Created opportunities for you
*	Provided a role model for you.

By doing one or more of these things they were fulfilling the role of a mentor in some way. Someone who is designated as a formal mentor will do all of the above.  The mentoring relationship will last over a period of time.  This allows mentor and mentee to get to know and trust one another.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, write down the qualities which you consider a good mentor would require.

----

 

==== Mentor qualities ====

We think that a good mentor should:

*	Provide a '''good role model'''

*	Possess excellent '''communication skills'''

*	Be able to '''empathise''' with the mentee

*	Recognise that learners have '''different motivations, skills, knowledge and needs''' and be able to capitalise on these

*	Be good at '''spotting learning opportunities''' and challenges which will assist the mentee’s development

*	Be '''well informed''' about the objectives and content of the training programme being undertaken by the mentee in order to provide maximum support

*	Provide '''meaningful feedback''' to the mentee

*	Understand that sometimes it may be necessary to '''push''' the mentee to move out of their comfort zone

*	Encourage the mentee to '''think for themselves''' and work out solutions to problems

From the above you can appreciate how useful coaches and mentors could be in supporting the learning programme which you are delivering.

To find out more about coaching and mentoring, look at:
*http://www.coachingnetwork.org.uk/ResourceCentre/WhatAreCoachingAndMentoring.htm

==== Training ====

Training is more directive than either coaching or mentoring.  It involves the learners receiving input from the trainer in the form of instruction.  Training is always specific and may be long or short term.  The trainer is your role! This unit explores the skills you require and the methods you may use to deliver direct training to the learners. 

As the trainer, you must consider the ways in which coaches and/or mentors could contribute to the progress of your learners.  You must exercise care in the choice of staff to undertake the coaching/mentoring role.  As well as having the necessary work-related knowledge and skills, they must be in a position to devote time to coaching/mentoring and should be able to develop a real rapport with your learners.

QUESTION TextEntry1: 
Coaching, Mentoring or Training

=== First line ICT support ===

You are designing and delivering training on ICT related topics.  It is therefore very likely that your learners themselves will be operating ICT equipment as part of the learning programme.  When a learner is using any type of computerised equipment, it is likely that from time to time some '''technical snags''' will arise.  

You must be able to assist the learner with straightforward trouble shooting e.g. printing problems because the page set-up is not correct; computer “hanging”; changing screen resolution.  You should also be able to assist any learner with special needs to use appropriate features of the technology. 

We are not suggesting that you should possess sophisticated trouble shooting skills: this is the responsibility of ICT technical staff.  You should simply be able to cope with typical, straightforward difficulties which can arise.

The next few pages summarise some of the most common problems you are likely to encounter, together with some tips on how to solve these.

==== The monitor appears blank ====

*	Check to see if the computer has ‘gone to sleep’ by pressing the '''space bar''' on the keyboard.

*	Check that the monitor is '''switched on''' and connected to the mains i.e. is the power light illuminated?

*	Check that the monitor is '''correctly connected''' to the computer.

*	Check to see if the system works after the computer is '''reset''' or switched off at the mains and on again.

 

==== The computer hangs ====

Sometimes, after using the computer for some time, it ‘hangs’; neither keyboard nor mouse appears to operate.

*	Wait a while to see if the computer is performing some '''intensive task''' and recovers.

*	Try '''CtrlAltDel'''.  If you are lucky it will bring up a task manager window which will show you which application is not responding and allow you to close down only that application.

*	Use the '''reset button''' to restart the computer.

*	'''Switch the computer off''' at the mains and then on again.

 
==== Monitor text is too small ====

Sometimes a client has difficulty reading off the monitor because the text is too small.

*	If this is confined to a particular application, it is usually possible to adjust the '''zoom setting'''.  If this does not appear in a box near the top of the window, it will be found in the menu system under View: Zoom or View: Text size.

*	If this applies to everything on the monitor, then, if you have access rights, you can change the '''monitor settings'''.  Right click with the mouse on the desktop, choose Properties from the resulting menu, choose the Settings tab from the dialogue box, reduce the Screen resolution setting and OK.  Unfortunately, the lower the screen resolution, the less can be displayed on the monitor.  This often results in an uneasy compromise for people with problems with their sight.

 

==== Nothing comes out of the printer ====

*	Check that the printer is switched on and connected to the mains i.e. is the power light illuminated?

*	Check that the printer is '''correctly connected''' to the computer.

*	Check that the printer has '''paper''' in it.

*	Check the '''ink supply'''.

*	Try printing a '''test page'''.

*	Check the print settings in both the operating system and the application to see that the computer is looking for the correct printer and that the correct size of paper has been selected and that manual/auto (as appropriate) is chosen.

 

==== Print layout is wrong ====

Sometimes the printer does not seem to use the whole of the sheet of paper and the layout is not the same as on the monitor.

When using a word processor like Word, it is possible to set the '''paper size''' in the application.  However there is also a setting for the printer itself.  If these two settings are different, then the output will not appear correctly on the page.  The driver for a newly connected printer may default to US legal for the paper size.  It is normal to use A4 in this country and applications will use this as default.  Go to the printer properties and check the paper size.  Start: Settings: Printers: right click on the printer concerned, choose Properties and select the Device settings tab.

 

==== Disk is full ====

Sometimes, when saving data from an Office application like Word, the message comes up that the disk is full.

*	It may be that the client’s '''floppy disk''' or '''pen drive''' is full.  This is quite likely for any sizeable word-processed document especially if it contains graphics or other embedded items.

*	A fault condition can arise concerning interaction between the application and the operating system which results in a false reporting of the disk full error.  This is irretrievable and requires the computer to be rebooted.  If the client will lose a fair amount of unsaved data, it is worth opening a new document and '''copy and pasting''' from the original to the new document and then trying to save that.  You may be lucky!

*	Note: a similar problem can occur regarding the '''computer''' running out of memory.  Again only rebooting the computer will correct the situation.

 

==== The printer jams ====

There is no universal solution for this problem as each printer has its own unique mechanism.  The best you can do is to familiarise yourself with the various types of printer in your library and how to un-jam each.

== Evaluate and revise learning materials and programmes ==
=== Assessing learner progress ===

When the learning programme is underway, you will want to '''review regularly''' how your learners are progressing towards their objectives. We should make it clear at this point that this unit is intended for library staff who find themselves in the role of educators and not for those who are required to undertake formal assessment of learners for National or Scottish Vocational Qualifications or other workplace awards. That type of assessment must be undertaken by someone who has an assessor or teacher qualification. 

In this unit we are concerned only with assessment which will give '''feedback''' to the learner on his/her progress towards the learning objectives and to you, the trainer, as to how effective the learning programme has been. (You may see this referred to as “formative” assessment.) In this context you will use methods which are as non-threatening as possible to the learner.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down any ways that you could use to assess how well your learners are progressing.

----
 

==== Methods of assessing progress ====

We can think of quite a few methods of assessing learner progress. Two of the commonest are:

*	Direct observation

*	Examination of products

 

==== Direct Observation ====

The most immediate method is to observe directly the '''activities''' being undertaken by the learners during the learning programme.  From this you will get a clear idea as to whether your learners are actually managing the tasks they have been set and how well they are coping.  

While you are not in any way ‘giving marks’, you can use this information in two ways.  Firstly you can use it to provide a little bit more assistance to any learners having difficulty. Secondly you can use it to assess the success of your own approach in delivering the learning.

Trainers benefit from '''observing the learners''' at all points in the learning programme, not just when they are involved in specific tasks. Their facial expressions and body language will give you feedback on how well the training is being received. If you notice a learner, yawning, fidgeting or gazing out of the window while you are explaining a topic, it is unlikely that they are absorbing the information fully. 

Perhaps they know this information already, perhaps the material is too advanced for them, perhaps your explanation has confused them – in all of these cases, you need to take some action in order to re-engage them in the learning process.

 

==== Examination of products ====

Many of the learning activities you will ask the learners to undertake will produce a result which can be checked.  This may be a '''printout''' or '''screen dump''' or perhaps a '''file'''.  This is an excellent method to use for feedback purposes because, if your learning is well designed, the product will not be seen as something artificial, produced solely for assessment purposes.  Also, as evidence, it should be fairly incontrovertible, either there will be a result or not. 

Examining products gives you '''feedback''' without the learner really being aware that their performance is being assessed. You can simply review the product with the learner, leading naturally into a discussion of how easy it was to produce this, how it might be improved etc.

 

==== Assessment ‘lite’ ====

You may find it useful to use some methods which veer in the direction of traditional educational assessment.  For example, you can carry out a '''quiz''' or use a simple tick box test.
You can construct these yourself or tap into ones which experts have designed.

----

[[Image:A Cap Digital.svg|50px]]
'''ACTIVITY 5.1'''

Go to http://www.learner.org/courses/neuroscience/interactives/interactive2.html and try the learning related quiz which explores whether your left of right side of the brain is dominant. This quiz is quick and fun to complete. Although it is simple it would give you some useful feedback on your learners if you asked them to complete it before embarking on the learning programme.
   
----

When making up simple tests, it is best to confine yourself to TRUE/FALSE or “fill in the blanks” (sometimes called CLOZE) questions. Compiling multiple-choice questions requires a great deal of skill and is best left to specialists.

==== Cloze Question on Word Processing ====

A text with a straight margin down the right hand side is called___________ justified.

==== Direct Feedback ====

Here you can obtain feedback from individual learners using '''verbal interaction'''.  This can best be done during or perhaps towards the end of a training session.  

You can also allow the learner to create direct feedback by issuing '''scorecards'''.  The learner can use these to record the tasks in which they consider themselves to be competent as they progress through the learning.

==== A simple scorecard ====

This illustrates a scorecard for a learner who is part way through a learning programme on training needs analysis techniques.

==== Computer Based Assessment ====

Some ICT based learning packages incorporate '''diagnostic tests''' which score and benchmark learner competence automatically as they work though the package.  It is best to use a method where the learner sees the result and not something which appears secret and is suddenly sprung on the learner at the end of the course of learning.

Alternatively you can use special software such as '''Hot Potatoes''' to create your own computer based assessment tools. If you wish to read more about this, look at:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/e-learning/tools/hot_potatoes

=== Designing feedback tools ===

The previous section dealt with '''evaluating''' the learning you have developed in terms of assessing the learners’ progress towards the learning objectives.  It is also important to evaluate the learning you have developed by getting feedback on the learning experience.  As you can imagine, the overall quality of the learning experience has a deal of effect on the rate of progress of the learner.

----

[[Image:T cap.gif|50px]]
Before proceeding, note down which aspects of the learning experience you would want to ask the learners about.

----

 

==== Aspects requiring feedback ====

Here is a list of issues we would expect to be included in feedback on the learning experience. You may have thought of some additional points.

*	Were the '''learning objectives''' relevant?

*	Did the '''content''' match the stated learning objectives?

*	Was the '''quality''' of the learning materials satisfactory?

*	Did the trainer provide sufficient '''support'''?

*	Was the trainer’s '''presentation''' clear?

*	Was the '''learning environment''' pleasant?

*	Were there any deficiencies or problems with the '''equipment'''?

*	Was the '''learning experience''' enjoyable?

You can see that we have included a mixture of issues relating to learning objectives and delivery/support, as well as on the learning environment and enjoyment.

 

==== Objectives related issues ====

*	Were the learning objectives relevant?

*	Did the content match the stated learning objectives?

This area is important because the learner’s '''perception''' of the relevancy of the objectives is what matters.  If you are not getting this relevancy over to the learners, then you will have great motivational problems.  Also once the learner has accepted that the objectives are relevant, they must experience the content you provide as being the correct material.  

Although trainers may sometimes dismiss '''negative feedback''' from one individual learner in this area, it is clear that a low score from a significant number of learners for this area needs a serious response on your behalf.

 

==== Delivery related issues ====

*	Was the '''quality''' of the learning materials satisfactory?

*	Did the trainer provide sufficient '''support'''?

*	Was the trainer’s '''presentation''' clear?

This are core areas for you as a trainer because they are the areas you have most control over and input into.

If the learners consider the '''quality of the learning materials''' to be unsatisfactory, you should probe this further to find the exact cause of their dissatisfaction – were the materials at the correct level, clearly expressed, professionally presented, attractive to look at etc.

Different learners will require varied '''levels of support''' from the trainer. In this instance, negative feedback from just one or two learners is significant because it can indicate that you have tailored your level of support to suit the majority of the group and ignored the needs of those who are finding the learning more difficult than average. 

Individual learners will undoubtedly have different views on the '''learning experience''' in terms of the trainer’s delivery – an element of personality is involved here.  But again, if there is not a broad positive result from your learners in this area, you will have to look very closely at what you are doing.  

 

==== Learning environment issues ====

*	Was the '''learning environment''' pleasant?

*	Were there any deficiencies or problems with the '''equipment'''?

This area is one where the trainer may have limited control.  If you are allocated a dingy windowless room in which to carry out the training, or if you are given an old slow PC to carry out your ICT demonstrations on, you will have real problems in providing a good learning experience.  Try to pre-empt complaints on the learning environment by resolving any such difficulties '''in advance''' of delivering the learning.

 

==== Enjoyable experience ====

*	Was the learning experience enjoyable?

Finally we consider an overall question as to whether the learning was enjoyable.  Is this a valid question?  Well, if the learners did not enjoy the experience, it is unlikely that they benefited fully from it or that they will ever come back willingly for more!

 

==== Feedback form design ====

There are different methods of obtaining feedback.  You can use '''paper forms''' handed out to the learners, or utilise a '''computerised approach'''.

==== Types of feedback form ====

As we saw on the previous page, you should try to create questions which are:

*	'''relevant''' to the area to be evaluated

*	expressed in '''neutral terms''' so as not to prompt a certain answer

*	'''clearly phrased''' and non ambiguous.

In order to compare feedback from different learners or groups of learners, it is best to design feedback forms in which learners can score different aspects of the learning on a scale, by ticking the box corresponding to their choice.

You might offer five choices.

{| style=&quot;width:50%; height:20px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:20px&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Very Poor'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Poor'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Acceptable'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Good'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Excellent'''
|}	

But you can apply some psychology here.  If you have an odd number of possible ratings as we have here (5), there is a tendency for learners just to choose the '''middle''' one.  You can try to force them to make a more measured evaluation by having an even number of possibilities which makes them positively choose.  

{| style=&quot;width:40%; height:20px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:20px&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Poor'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Acceptable'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Good'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; |'''Excellent'''
|}	

These four categories can be represented by numerical values, say zero to three. 

*Poor = 0
*Acceptable = 1	
*Good = 2	
*Excellent = 3

Doing this, allows you to carry out some simple statistics, such as finding the average response for the whole group of learners and to compare the overall response of different groups.

==== Feedback statistics ====

Perhaps it’s easier to see this in an example. Imagine you have a group of 10 learners. Their answers to the questions on the feedback form are:

*Poor – 0 responses
*Acceptable – 3 responses
*Good – 6 responses
*Excellent – 1 response

This converts to a total of 18  (0x0 + 3x1 + 6x2 + 1x3). Dividing 18 by the number of learners (10) gives an '''overall score''' of 1.8 for the group as a whole, equating to Good.

Another way of looking at this data is to produce a '''graph'''.

[[image:feedbackstats.png]] 

You can then make a '''visual comparison''' of the results for each question.

==== Unstructured feedback ====

Of course you should allow the learners to provide some feedback on the form which is not structured by your questions.  It is important to leave space for them to make '''comments''', either throughout the form at appropriate questions or at the end under ‘any other comments’.  

To analyse these, you should simply list the actual responses and note any duplicated points of view.

There are a couple of other points to note apart from question design if you are to motivate your learners to make a good job of completing the form

Before proceeding, note down anything else that you can think of that should be in the '''feedback form design''' if it is to be successful in its purpose.

==== Essential elements of feedback form design ====

Well, for the form to be successful, the '''instructions must be easily understood''' and it should be '''easy to fill in'''.  It should also be '''quick''' for the learner to complete.  This all suggests a '''short questionnaire''', one or two sides maximum with a limited number of questions having straightforward possible responses

==== Simple feedback form ====

You can find many examples of simple course feedback forms on the internet

==== Commercial software and websites ====

You may also like to explore using commercial software such as '''SurveyMonkey''' which facilitates design of survey forms and collation and analysis of results via the Internet.  
See it at http://www.surveymonkey.com 

There are many Internet websites offering advice on feedback form and questionnaire design.  One problem is that many of them are aimed at professional researchers and thus too detailed.  However, you may still benefit from looking at some of these sites, as the basic principles of questionnaire design are the same, regardless of the subject area being researched. Here are some suggested sites.
*http://www.sysurvey.com/tips/wording.htm
*http://www.statpac.com/surveys/question-qualities.htm

=== Assessing success of learning approaches ===

The diagram shows the training cycle.  It represents a continuous process of:

*	Identification of training needs
*	Design of the training and learning programme
*	Delivery of training and learning programme
*	Evaluation of training and learning programme

For more information on the training cycle see:

http://mournetrainingservices.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/training-cycle-explained.html

You have carried out the first three stages and are now about to carry out the fourth with the help of the feedback on the learning experience coupled with evidence on learner progress.  
In particular, the feedback will be used to assess the effectiveness of the design and delivery of the programme. This will feed into '''revision''' of those aspects of the learning programme which were judged to be less than satisfactory.  With a further check on the identification of the needs and the re-design of materials and delivery, a cycle of continuous improvement is established.

You have essentially two sources of information for your evaluation:

*	the '''evidence''' of learner progress
*	the '''feedback''' on the quality of the learning experience.

Both are important and there are definite connections between the two. For instance, there could be a general reduction in learner progress not related to content and delivery issues but due to the learning taking place in a room which is always too hot resulting in the learners experiencing discomfort.

 

==== Learner progress ====

In analysing the learner progress, in order to create improvements, you must look for '''trends'''. The first time you deliver the training to a small group, poor performance from one learner may affect your results disproportionately.  Over time and a large number of learners, this random effect diminishes.  So you are looking for the particular topics and outcomes where a significant number of learners have difficulty.  

Of course ‘a significant number’ is a matter of opinion.  But let us say that, if out of a group of fifteen learners, three had a difficulty with one topic, while excelling at all the other topics, then we would say that is significant.  So you need to look for these parts of the learning and revisit the design of those parts.

 

==== Learning experience ====

Most of the feedback will have been converted into a set of averaged numerical data representing the learner group as a whole.  You now have to '''interpret''' this data.  Broadly speaking, you are having no real problems if the scores hit a point somewhere a bit above the middle value.  You cannot expect every learner to think that everything is perfect.  On the other hand, remember that most people tend not to give low scores unless there is a real problem.  Of course different learners will have different '''expectations'''.  However, again the hope is that they will apply the same expectation level to each of the facets of the learning experience and this variable will average out over all the questions and learners.

There is one danger in using the '''average''' and getting a middling score.  That is, if out of a group of, say, twenty learners, ten score highest and the other ten score lowest.  This gives the appearance of a just acceptable result with no great worry. A score of 50% for the learning environment could be due to one side of a room being too cold. A score of 50% for relevance of course content could be due to a group of 20 where 10 thought the training was pitched at the ideal level and 10 who found most of the content already familiar. 

So remember, you have to look at both the '''average score''' and the '''spread of scores''' across the group of learners.

 

==== Looking for trends ====

Regarding ‘Any other comments’, you are again looking for '''trends'''.  If the same type of comments comes up three or four times out of a group of fifteen learners, then you need to address it.

When you are delivering training to colleagues within your own organisation, remember that you need not be completely reliant on written feedback forms. Most of the learners will be willing to provide '''informal feedback''' and suggestions for improvement orally. 

You should also consider when to gather feedback. It is useful to gather opinions immediately after the conclusion of the training, when the content and delivery are fresh in the learners’ minds. This can be supplemented by '''further feedback''' at a later date, if you wish to explore how useful the training has been to the learners in their workplace situation.

Blanking pages, while it does get our attention, it makes it difficult to determine the reasons why you wanted this content removed.  Because this is also done sometimes to vandalize pages, we (the cleanup crew here on Wikibooks) recommend that you use the editing markup &quot;tag&quot; for deletion like this:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|(state your reason here)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

This can be added at anyplace in the text of the page, and don't bother removing any content, even if it may seem offensive.  This just gives a chance for a second opinion on the page to determine if it really needs removal.  Most reasonable requests for deletion generally do happen.

BTW, thank you so much for contributing to Wikibooks, and I hope that you do continue with the development of the [[Acoustics]] Wikibook that you have started.  It looks like an interesting topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:40, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

Western Music History can be traced back to Medieval times, with the Introduction of Chanting (later termed Gregorian Chanting) into the Catholic church services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation and more focus on secular themes that occurred in the Renaissance period. We then have expansions of range and complexity as we move into the Baroque era. The Classical era gives us the emotional power associated with such composers as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Romanticism then transforms the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more individualistic stylizations.  Tonality was at its peak during this period, then Impressionist music paved the way to the use of extreme dissonances in the music of the Modern era.  This process continued into the current Contemporary period of music.

== A Note Time Periods ==
There is no clear line when the Renaissance began and the Middle Ages ended. For western art music, there is no clear dividing point - the Renaissance in music happened at different times in different places. So for convenience, we will use 1400 A.D. as the start of the Renaissance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows; notable among them were:
*The Aeoline, by German Bernhard Eschenbach (and his cousin, Caspar Schlimbach), 1810.
**Was a piano with added aeoline register.
**Aeoline Harmonika and Pysharmonika are very similar names at that time.
*** Aeoline and Aura ware first without bellows or keyboard. This originals eventually evolved in Harmonica
*The Hand Physhamonika Anton Haeckel 1818 Hand type mentioned in music newspaper 1821.
*The flutina, by Pichenot Jeune, ca. 1831
*The concertina, patented in two forms (perhaps independently):
**Carl Friedrich Uhlig, 1834.
**Sir Charles Wheatstone, examples built after 1829, but not patented until 1844

An instrument called '''accordion''' was first patented in 1829 by Cyrill Demian in Vienna.  (Interestingly, the original patent shows the name &quot;eoline&quot; crossed out and replaced with &quot;accordion&quot; in different handwriting).  Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments: It only had a left hand keyboard; the right hand simply operated the bellows.  One key feature for which Damian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key.  His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key: one for each bellows direction (press, draw); this is called a ''bisonoric'' action. 

At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with &quot;Kanzellen&quot; (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The diatonic key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough to for travellers to take with them and use to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both bass and treble sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.

The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 &quot;Schule für Accordion&quot;.
At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's flutina resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and tone colour, but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally.  The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left.  When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today. 

Further innovations followed and continue to the present: Various keyboard systems have been developed; voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves) have been developed, with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance; different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability, and so on.

''This module currently draws heavily on text from the Wikipedia [[w:Accordion|Accordion]] article.''

[[File:Piano-Accordion.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|A piano accordion]]
The '''piano accordion''' is the instrument most often indicated by the term &quot;accordion&quot;, but it is one of the most recent inventions among accordion types, appearing late in the 19th century and not accepted worldwide until the early 20th century.  It has a right-hand keyboard similar to a piano. This is great news for you if you ever took piano lessons!

The left hand keyboard is usually configured in the Stradella system, a combination of chords and single notes, arranged in a uniform series by harmonic relationship.  This is the system we'll be focusing on throughout this book. 

Occasionally, a ''free bass'' left hand is used, which has a series of single buttons in an arrangement similar to the chromatic button accordion.  The free bass system facilitates the playing of bass melodies and counterpoint over a melodic span greater than one octave.  It also allows for chord inversion and invention of chords not present in the Stradella system, although the Stradella system also allows creation of extra chords and inversions using simultaneous multiple chord buttons. 

''Converter'' bass systems allow an instrument to be readily converted from a Stradella system to a free-bass system with a switch.

== DXFortran ==

The DXFortran project has for purpose the development of a vectorial graphical library in DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) format for FORTRAN90 programmers. It's a freeware distribution. 

URL:http://www.ualg.pt/est/adec/csc/dxfortran

=== Introduction ===

''' The Purpose '''

The DXFortran project has for purpose the development of a vectorial graphical library in DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) format for FORTRAN90 programmers. It's a freeware distribution.

The intention of the creation of this graphical library is to allow to the programmers in FORTRAN90 to generate automatically graphical in vectorial format, without the necessity to know the DXF structure .

The reason of the development of this tool is related with the DXF great portability and to be able to support the development of graphical tools, where CAD systems handling is necessary.

''' The structure '''

The DXFortran will be constituted by a standard library (DXFortranStd), this library has all the basic commands in format DXF such as:

* dfLine() - LINE
* dfPline() - POLYLINE
* dfText() - TEXT
* etc...

The library will support the following properties:

* Layer;
* 3D;
* color;
* line type;
* etc...

From the DXFortran Standard will be constructed thematic librarys, for example:

* DXFortran Math - library of graphical functions for mathematical applications.
* DXFortran Engineering - library of graphical functions for engineering applications.
* etc...

''' The developmet '''

The DXFortran Standart Library will be developed by the project team (Davide Santos and Carlos Silva).

The team will continue to contribute with thematic functions and to manage the relative code of the contributions to the project.

For the users who want to contribute also a set of rules of code writing will be available in the project page , elaborated in accordance with the European normalization for the FORTRAN90 writing.

In each function (routine), it will be indicated in the header, the name and origin (work place and Country) of the authors.

''' The use of the library '''

The library will be available under source code.

Each user will have to include the module of the DXFortranStd and the module of the desired function, in the code of its program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Java:class}} is a Java keyword
which begins the declaration and definition of a [[Java Programming/Classes and Objects|class]].

The general syntax of a class declaration, using {{Java:EBNF}}, is

 class-declaration ::= &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Java:access-modifiers}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{Java:class}} {{Java:identifier}}
                       [''extends-clause''] [''implements-clause''] 
                       ''class-body''
 
 extends-clause ::= {{Java:extends}} ''class-name''
 implements-clause ::= {{Java:implements}} ''interface-names'' 
 interface-names ::= ''interface-name'' [&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; ''interface-names'']
 class-body ::= '''&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;''' [''member-declarations''] '''&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;'''
 member-declarations = ''member-declaration'' [''member-declarations'']
 member-declaration = ''field-declaration'' 
                      | ''initializer'' 
                      | ''constructor'' 
                      | ''method-declaration''
                      | ''class-declaration''

The {{java:extends}} word is optional. If omitted, the class extends the {{java:Object}} class, as all Java classes inherit from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Medieval period dates approximately from 476 A.D. to 1400 A.D.

During this time European society was rigidly divided into three social classes: the nobility, consisting of kings, queens, barons, princes and lords; serfs and peasants; and thirdly, the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. All segments of society felt the power of the Roman Catholic Church because Christianity had risen in western Europe to fill the power vacuum left by the demise of the Roman empire around the fourth century. Rome still exerted a powerful influence over western Europe especially after the Roman Emperor, Constantine, converted to Christianity. Rome at the beginning of the Medieval period was still a distributive base of regional information and a central hub of European learning. It was also the cumulative center of Christian liturgical musical life. Many musicians were priests or members (predominantly of minor orders) of the clergy, and as such liturgical singing played an important role in worship. It is thought that the church discouraged the use of musical instruments although we can infer from period paintings and literary descriptions that instruments were played. It is thought that instruments were used when good singers were not available. The instruments would then either replace the vocal part or help the voice stay in tune. The church discouraged instruments because it was the desire of the church leaders to keep the congregation's focus on the words that were being sung. Anything that would detract from that was considered at odds with the holy purpose of the music.

== Gregorian Chant (plainsong) ==

[[File:Francisco de Zurbarán 040.jpg|thumb|right|Pope Gregory by Francisco de Zurbarán - painted 1626-1627. Though there are no contempoary images existing, the life of Gregory has inspired generations of artists to put brush to canvas.]]

For over 1000 years, the official music of the Roman Catholic Church was the Gregorian Chant, which was named after Pope Gregory I. He began the task of organizing and codifying the chants in the 6th century used by the church.  By the era of Charlemagne in the early 9th century, Gregorian Chant was a mostly unified body of music throughout western Europe.

With Gregorian Chant, there is no definite sense of rhythm, the timing is very flexible and there is no sense of beat. This creates a floating, improvisational quality to the music. The chant essentially consists of a Melody, set to a sacred Latin text, sung unaccompanied which moves by stepwise motion within a narrow range of pitches. It  may be either Syllabic - one note for each syllable - or Melismatic - many notes to one syllable. The composers of the chants were anonymous, and the chants were based on church modes (Ionian, Dorian etc...).

== Development of Polyphony ==

Polyphony was developed during the period of 700 A.D. to 900 A.D. where the chant melody was duplicated at an interval of a 4th or a 5th. The voices moved in parallel motion with the actual chant being sung by the bottom voice. Medieval music consisting of Gregorian chant and one or more melodic lines moving in parallel motion is called Organum. 
		 
From 900 A.D. to 1200 A.D Organum became truly polyphonic, with the melodic lines becoming independent and each line had its own rhythm and own melody. Generally, the chant in the bottom voice was sung in very long, drawnout notes, while the added melody on top moved in shorter note values. Early polyphony was still quite rhythmically free.	 
		 
Then during the period of 1170 A.D. to 1200 A.D. the Notre Dame School of Composers developed rhythmic innovations. The leading composers at the school were Leonin and Perotin, who used measured rhythm with definite time values and a clearly defined meter. The newly developed notation indicated precise rhythms and pitches. However, the beat could only be subdivided into threes, which was symbolic of the Trinity. Few triads were used, resulting in Medieval polyphony sounding very hollow, thin and stark to the modern ear. The interval of a 3rd was hardly ever used as it was considered to sound dissonant...

== Secular Music ==

The first large body of decipherable, secular songs that have survived, comes from the 12th and 13th centuries. It was written by French noblemen Troubadours (coming from Southern France) and the Trauvéres (coming from Northern France). Most of the songs deal with the subject of love. There were also dance and spinning songs (spinning songs come from when the maidens would spin cloth and sing songs to pass the time). Their songs were played mainly by court minstrels. Many of the songs have been preserved because the nobility had clerics to write down the songs.

Secular songs also appear in Italy, Spain, England and Germany. They use a regular beat, unlike the Gregorian Chant. Instruments used included : Harps; Fiddles, Recorders; Lutes; Flutes; Shawms; and Bagpipes.

== Ars Nova (new art) ==

''Ars Nova'' began in the 14th century as a result of a conscious effort to write music in a new style. An essay entitled “Ars Nova”, by Phillipe de Vitry (a musical theorist), was published describing the new characteristics of style in music.

A significant development in rhythm which occurred during this period was that the beat could now be subdivided into two equal parts. Syncopation was introduced and polyphonic compositions became increasingly complex and sophisticated. One important form of music was the Mass, consisting of the PROPER and the ORDINARY. Composers set the ordinary to music which contained five sung prayers : Kyrie; Gloria; Credo; Sanctus; Agnus Dei.

== Hildegard von Bingen (1098 - 1179) ==

Hildegard was a female German composer, born the last of ten children.  She was given to the church as a tithe, as it was custom to give the Roman Catholic Church one tenth of a family's possessions.  She became known for having diverse occupations, such as composer, musician, playwright, and poet, among others.  She was a master of the Gregorian chant, a craft that began as early as the 5th century.

== Leoninus (died c. 1201) ==
Leonin, a French composer, was the first-known significant one to write in polyphonic organum.  He most likely worked at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and heralded the Notre Dame school of polyphony.  His widely known moniker is the French form of his Latin name, Leoninus. He wrote a book called Magnus liber organi, which was a great book of religious music. Later it was revised by Perotinus.

== Perotin (fl. c. 1200) ==
Perotin is arguably the most well-known figure in the Notre Dame school of polyphony.  Like Leonin, he is assumed to be French, and the name Perotin is derived from his Latin name, Perotinus.  He is often paired with Leonin as they both pioneered choral polyphony.  He expanded on the developments of Leonin, and helped create three and four-part polyphony. ''Viderunt omnes'' is an example of a Gregorian chant, written centuries before, in which Perotin inserted an organum.

== Guillaume de Machaut (1300 - 1377) ==

Guillaume de Machaut was arguably one of the most important composers of Medieval Music. He was a poet and musician born in France who wrote in the ''Ars Nova'' style. He mainly composed secular music and worked for various royal families. He travelled extensively and his output consisted mainly of love songs for two voices and instrumental accompaniment. He is most famous for his ‘Missa Notra Dame’ (Notre Dame Mass), which is one of the finest compositions of the 14th century. It was the first polyphonic setting of the Mass Ordinary and was written for four voices – possibly doubled by instruments. 

'''Agnus Dei movement'''
Arranged for four voices – one soprano, two altos and one tenor. It made use of triple meter – symbol of the Trinity - and consisted of complex rhythms and syncopation. The two upper parts are rhythmically active while the two lower parts move in longer note values and play a supportive role. The movement includes dissonances and triads which sounds fuller than previous Organum.

== Francesco Landini (c. 1325 - 1397) ==
The Italian Landini, like Hildegard, fits the characteristics of a Renaissance man.  He was a composer, singer, organist, instrument maker, and poet.  He was a master of the trecento.  Though considered a Medieval composer by most musicologists, his music paved the way for the musical quattrocento and the early Renaissance, both of which began around 1400.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Renaissance Period spans from circa 1400 A.D. to 1600 A.D. The word 'Renaissance' is of French origin and means &quot;a rebirth of interests&quot;, especially in the arts of ancient Greece and Rome (i.e. : antiquity). This renewed interests stems from the fact that a large amount of art work from antiquity was discovered during the Renaissance period. The Renaissance was predominantly a period of exploration, for example, the voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama occurred during this period.

The Renaissance was also an age of individualism and curiosity, the predominate example is seen in the life of Leonardo da Vinci. Education in the Renaissance was encyclopedic in nature. The people of the time believed in educating themselves in a vast number of fields, from art to science to history to architecture.

The Catholic Church was less powerful than it was in the Middle Ages, and no longer had the monopoly on learning.

The ‘Reformation’ movement challenged the corrupt practices of the Catholic Church, and was inaugurated by people such as John Calvin and Martin Luther. The Catholic Church answered with the ‘Counter-Reformation’ from 1562 A.D. to 1563 A.D.  A committee of Cardinals met over a period of 20 years to discuss corruption that has crept in to the church (e.g., Secular songs during church services). This committee of Cardinals was started by the Council of Trent. They complained about the complex polyphony prevalent in sacred music as it made the text too hard to hear over the overlapping voices.  There were also complaints about the secular elements in sacred music as some masses were based upon popular melodies of the time.

Aristocrats and upper middle class considered education a status symbol and hired scholars to teach their children.

== Music in the Renaissance Era ==

Around 1450 A.D. the printing press was invented. This widened the circulation of music. This helped music to play an increasingly important role in daily life. Musicians worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. However, musical activity shifted to the courts. Kings and princes competed for the finest composers.

Many leading important composers came from Holland, Belgium and Northern France, called the ‘Franco-Flemish’ composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical lives include Germany, England and Spain.

== Characteristics of Renaissance Music ==

'''WORDS and MUSIC'''

Renaissance vocal music was more important than instrumental music. Nevertheless, many songs were accompanied by instruments. These instruments were commonly members of the lute, organ, recorder, or viol families.

There was a close relationship between the words and the music. Composers wanted to enhance the meaning and emotion of the text, and did so by means of ‘word painting’ - trying to project poetic imagery through link between music and words. As vocal music was more important, most music was sung ''a cappella''.

'''TEXTURE'''

Two basic textures existed. Firstly HOMOPHONIC, where parts move in step with one another (like a hymn) – rhythms are the same. Secondly POLYPHONIC, where each voice is of equal importance and contrapuntal imitation was an important procedure. The bass register was now used for the first time, producing richer harmonies, and extending the range of the voices. There was a change from successive to simultaneous writing in music. That is, from linear, voice-by-voice to ‘cyclical’, considering all voices at once whilst writing.

NOTE : contrapuntal imitation 	
* adjective of counterpoint.
* the ability to say two things at once comprehensibly. In essence, counterpoint is the same as polyphony.

'''Rhythm and Melody'''

In Renaissance music, there is a gentle flow, moving away from sharply defined beats. Melodies are easy to sing as they move along a scale with few leaps. This is called conjunct motion. However, Melodies were still modal.

'''The &quot;Contenance Angloise&quot;'''

Humanists thought that consonance and dissonance should be determined by the human ear, not by mathematics as many older thinkers, such as Pythagoras, believed. In the middle ages, intervals of seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths were thought to be dissonant, as per mathematics. Fourths, fifths, and octaves were considered consonant. With humanism gaining influence during the Renaissance, musicians began using their intuition to determine consonance and dissonance. Fourths became considered dissonant, while thirds and sixths became considered consonant. Composers of the Renaissance began exhibiting this new classification of intervals in their works. This new style was first popular with English composers, particularly John Dunstable.  From there it moved to continental Europe. The French poet Martin le Franc dubbed this new style the &quot;Contenance Angloise&quot; meaning &quot;English Guise.&quot;

== Sacred Music ==

Two main forms of sacred music existed. Firstly, the motet; a short, polyphonic, choral work set to a sacred Latin text. The motet was performed as a short religious ritual such as the communion. Secondly the Mass; a longer work, comprised of all five movements of the Ordinary.

== The Early Renaissance ==

===Italy===
The musical Renaissance began in northern Italy around 1400.  One of the prominent groups that was very influential in shaping the early Renaissance was the Florentine School in Florence, Italy.  The quattrocento, which might have begun slightly earlier than 1400, overlaps the late Medieval and early Renaissance periods.  Nevertheless, it is generally considered to be part of the early Renaissance.  Notable composers include the following:
*Zacara da Teramo (c. 1350-c. 1413)
*Paolo da Firenze (c. 1355-c. 1436)
*Giovanni Mazzuoli (1360-1426)
*Bartolomeo da Bologna (fl. 1405-1427)
*Antonio da Cividale (fl. 1392-1421)
*Antonius Romanus (fl. 1400-1432)
*Cristoforo de Monte (1383-?)
*Nicolaus Zacharie (c. 1400 – 1466)
*Johannes de Quadris (c. 1410 – c. 1457)
*Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro (c. 1420 – 1484).

===John Dunstable (c. 1390 - 1453)===
Dunstable was an English composer, renowned during his lifetime and influential throughout Europe.  A comtemporary of Leonel Power (an English composer probably born slightly before Dunstable), his music bridges the late Medieval and early Renaissance styles.  He also helped develop the style of the early Renaissance Burgundian School.

===Guillaume Dufay (1397 - 1474)===
Dufay was a Franco-Flemish composer and the central figure of the Burgundian School.  He was ordained a priest but composed both sacred and secular music.  He learned his craft from cathedral authorities, and he spent a chunk of his life in Italy, where he stayed intermittently and met the composers Hugo and Arnold de Lantins.  One of his most famous compositions is the motet ''Nuper rosarum flores'' (1436), which incorporates both the old isorhythmic style and the new contrapuntal style.

===Gilles Binchois (1400 - 1460)===
Binchois was another Franco-Flemish composer who was influential in the Burgundian School.  He is often compared to Dufay, and there is even a contemporary portrait of them together.  Like Dufay, he is one of the earliest members of the Burgundian School.  Although often ranked behind Dufay and Dunstable by musicologists and other scholars, Binchois is debated by others as being more influential than the other two.  His melodies are easy to be sung and are familiar to those interested in early Renaissance music.

== Josquin Desprez (1450 - 1521) ==

Josquin was an important composer of Renaissance music. He was a contemporary of Christopher Columbus and Leonardo Da Vinci, and considered a master of Renaissance music. He had an international career, being born in Belgium and spending most of his life in Italy, serving Dukes and Popes. Later he worked for King Louis XII of France.

His output includes masses, motets and secular vocal pieces, and he strongly influenced other composers. He has many published volumes of music devoted exclusively to him. This was testimony to his skills as a composer as only a select few were chosen to have their works published.

== Ave Maria (by Josquin Desprez) ==

This piece was a Latin prayer to the Virgin Mary, written as a four voiced motet. It opens with strict, contrapuntal / polyphonic imitation. It is an example of true polyphonic writing, as each phrase has a different melody. There is overlapping, which creates a continuous flow. However this makes it difficult to understand text, but creates continuity in the music. There is varied texture, as he uses imitation for three and four voices, then paired imitation for two voices. This variation of texture was introduced by Josquin. Two voices sing together, then they are imitated by another two voices. In bar 31 of this piece we see a move to homophony, where the voices are singing in step with one another.  There is then a change in meter from duple to triple, with the use of third’s.

== Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525 – 1594) ==

Palestrina was a very prolific composer of the Late Renaissance period who was born in the town of Palestrina, near Rome. Though he also wrote secular madrigals, he is most famous for his masses and sacred motets. His works are known for their beauty and the relative ease for a listener to understand the texts compared to those in other polyphonic works.

== Missa: “Papae Marcelli” (by Palestrina) ==

Palestrina's most famous work was Missa Papae Marcelli, which he dedicated to Pope Marcellus II. Palestrina was concerned with a clear projection of the text, as the church was becoming concerned about the infiltration of complex polyphony, which was obscuring the text. It was written for Soprano, Alto, two Tenors, and two Basses, which makes it sounds fuller due to the six voices. For many years their was a legend that this mass was so beautiful that it convinced the Council of Trent not to ban polyphonic music from the church altogether. This story, however, is not true.
Palestrina was born just outside of Rome. He was devoted to Catholic Church music, with his career based in Rome. He spent most of his life as director of three of the most celebrated Roman Catholic churches: St. Peter’s; St. John Lateran; and Santa Maria Maggiore. His output consisted of 104 masses, and over 450 sacred works. He was influenced greatly by the Counter-Reformation and the Council of Trent.

== Secular Music ==

During Renaissance, secular vocal music became increasingly popular. Music was set to poems in various languages, including Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, German, Dutch and English. The invention of the printing press helped to spread popular music. Thousands of song collections became available. This led to a rise in more national genres. These included the Parisian Chanson, the Italian Frottola, the Italian Madrigal, the English Madrigal, and the English Lute Song.

Music became important for leisure purposes, with every educated person being expected to play an instrument. Music was generally written for solo voices with instrumental accompaniment. However, with the rise of printing, instrumental music was becoming more important, with wide variety of instruments being used. These included recorders, viols, keyboard instruments and woodwinds.

== The Venetian School ==

As the name suggests, this school of music was based in Venice. It was the center of instrumental and vocal music. It was also a thriving commercial center, responsible for much trade between Venice and the East. The Venetian School operated out of St. Marks’  Cathedral, with Willaert and Gabrielli as its music directors. Willaert and Gabrielli directed the orchestra and choir for the church. Venetian composers wrote polychoral music (for many choirs), with the choir always accompanied by instruments. Their music tended to be more homophonic in texture.

== William Byrd (c. 1540 - 1623) ==
Byrd is one of the most famous English composers of the Renaissance.  Although he never made the transition to the new Baroque style, his keyboard music is said to have marked the beginning of the Baroque organ and harpsichord style.  Little is known about his early life.  However, he is known to have composed many masses, motets, psalmes, sonnets, and songs, in addition to his keyboard works.  Contemporary English composers include Thomas Tallis, John Bull, John Dowland, Thomas Weelkes, and Orlando Gibbons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the second lesson teaching you how to read, write and pronounce Greek. In the last lesson, you have already learned the letters alpha, iota, kappa, omicron, tau and rho. Now, we will slowly build on those, so that you can read more words. At the end of this lesson you will find the translations of the words. First try to find out the meanings on your own!

The next letter you should learn is Nu (this letter is pronounced ni in Greek):

&lt;font size=4&gt;Ν ν&lt;/font&gt;

Again the capital letter looks the same as in the Latin alphabet. The small letter looks similar to a lowercase V. It's still pronounced like a regular N (IPA [n]) though. It also appears in the following names that you should be able to read now:

'''ΝΑΤΟ''' (very difficult ;-) ) &lt;br&gt;
'''Άννα''' (a girl's name) &lt;br&gt;
'''Ιράν''' (a country in the Middle East) &lt;br&gt;
'''Κίνα''' (a country in the Far East) &lt;br&gt;
'''Τίρανα''' (capital city of Albania) &lt;br&gt;
'''Ανόι''' (capital city of Vietnam) &lt;br&gt;


Next letter is Mu:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Μ μ&lt;/font&gt;

While the capital letter is identical again, the lower letter is decidedly different from the Latin one this time. It's very commonly used as a special symbol in various academic fields though. The pronunciation is just like a regular M (IPA [m]). Here are words with Mu:

'''μαμά''' (every child's call) &lt;br&gt;
'''Μαρόκο''' (African country south of Spain) &lt;br&gt;
'''Ομάν''' (Arabic country) &lt;br&gt;
'''Αμμάν''' (capital of Jordan) &lt;br&gt;
'''Μαρκ''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Μαρία''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Μόνικα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''αρμονία''' &lt;br&gt;
'''άτομο''' &lt;br&gt;
'''μονοτονία''' &lt;br&gt;


I'd also like you to meet the letter Epsilon:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Ε ε&lt;/font&gt;

Capital letter as in the Latin alphabet, small letter a variation on the capital letter. You have probably seen it before. Epsilon is pronounced approximately as in b'''e'''t (IPA [ε]). German &quot;B'''e'''tt&quot; and French &quot;m'''è'''re&quot; are exactly the same as this Greek sound. Practise reading some more words:

'''Αρμενία''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Κορέα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Κάρμεν''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Κατερίνα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''κέικ''' &lt;br&gt;
'''κρέμα''' &lt;br&gt;
'''κάμερα''' &lt;br&gt;


Finally, here's the letter Lambda:

&lt;font size=4&gt;Λ λ&lt;/font&gt;

This is the equivalent of the letter L. It looks quite different, but you will probably be able to memorise it quickly anyway (anyone familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet will immediately notice its similarity with the letter Л). Be careful not to confuse a capital alpha with a capital lambda! Here are a few more words to practise, and of course this letter and all the others will frequently appear in the following lessons, too.

'''αλκοόλ''' &lt;br/&gt;
'''κιλό''' &lt;br/&gt;
'''Ιταλία''' &lt;br/&gt;
'''καραμέλα''' &lt;br/&gt;


That's it for this lesson! If you didn't have trouble reading the example words, you're ready to continue with [[../Lesson 3x|lesson 3]]!

=Number Systems=
Necessary reading, this. Computers don't count the same way you and I do.

==Decimal==
All number systems use a particular radix. Radix is synonymous with &quot;base&quot; if it helps, although I should caution you that saying such things as &quot;All you radix are belong to us&quot; is a great way to get people to throw pointy things at you (but whether it's because of the horrid pun or the tired pop-culture reference is hard to say... :-). To understand what a radix is, consider our everyday system of numbers, which uses base ten.

Like you learned in grade school and forgot over summer, in a base ten number, each digit specifies a certain power of 10, and as a consequence you need ten different digits to denote any number. The rightmost digit specifies 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the second digit specifies 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the third 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and so on.
You can, therefore, break down a decimal number, such as 2763&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, like this (although it does wind up to be redundant):

 2763&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;  = (2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
         = (2 x 1000) + (7 x 100) + (6 x 10) + (3 x 1)
         = 2000 + 700 + 60 + 3
         = 2763&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

Computers enjoy working with two other bases: binary and hexadecimal. Octal is base-8, and seems to have died out. The only operating system to use octal was UNIX.

==Binary==
Binary is a base-2 system, so it uses only two digits (0 and 1), and each digit represents a power of 2:

 10110101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0 x 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0 x 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (0 x 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1 x 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
            = (1 x 128) + (0 x 64) + (1 x 32) + (1 x 16) + (0 x 8) + (1 x 4) + (0 x 2) + (1 x 1)
            = 128 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 1
            = 181&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

A single binary digit is familiarly called a bit. Eight bits are called a byte. Other combinations you could hear about:
Name 	Size
nibble 	4 bits
word 	16 bits
dword
	32 bits
quadword 	64 bits
Since the Z80 can directly manipulate only bytes and words (and nibbles in some circumstances), the majority of data handling you do will involve mostly those, so you don't have to concern yourself with the others too much (although it would still be a good idea to familiarize yourself with them).

We will find ourselves working with, or at the very least referencing the individual bits of a byte or word. The nomenclature:

* If we arranged the bits out horizontally, we call the rightmost bit &quot;bit 0&quot;, and each bit to the left is given a number one greater.
* The leftmost and rightmost bits are given special names: the leftmost bit is called the high-order bit or the most-significant bit (since it controls the highest power of two of the number, it makes the most significant contribution to the value). The rightmost bit is called the low-order bit or the least-significant bit.
* We can apply these points to nibbles in a byte, bytes in a word or dword, etc. So for example the rightmost byte in a 64-bit quantity would be termed the least-significant byte.

==Hexadecimal==
Hexadecimal is base-16, so it uses 16 digits: the regular digits 0 to 9, and the letters A to F that correspond to the decimal values 10 to 15.

 1A2F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;  = (1 x 16&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (10 x 16&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (2 x 16&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (15 x 16&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)
         = (1 x 4096) + (10 x 256) + (2 x 16) + (15 x 1)
         = 4096 + 2560 + 32 + 15
         = 6703&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

Hex values have an interesting relationship with binary: take the number 11010011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In hex, this value is represented as D3&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, but consider the individual digits:

D&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = 1101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

3&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = 0011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Compare these two binary numbers with the original. You should see that one hex digit is equivalent to one nibble. This is what's so great about hexadecimal, converting binary numbers used by the computer into more manageable hex values is a snap.

==Designating Base==
To designate base above, we have adopted the notation used by many mathematicians by writing the radix as a subscript. Too bad we must write assembly code in plain text format, which has no capability for such niceties. The way to denote radix varies, but in all cases it involves attaching an extra character or characters to the number. TASM gives you a choice between a symbolic prefix or an alphabetic suffix.
 Prefix Format  Suffix Format   Base
 %10011011      10011011b       Binary
 $31D0          31D0h           Hexadecimal
 @174           174o            Octal
 12305 *        12305d          Decimal
 * no prefix
It doesn't matter which format you use, provided you don't mix them (like $4F33h). The prefix formats may be easier to read, since the letter sort of gets lost among the numbers (especially if it's upper case).

=Registers=
Registers are sections of very expensive RAM inside the CPU that are used to store numbers and rapidly operate on them. There are fourteen registers on this CPU: A B C D E F H I L R PC SP IX and IY. You don't need to concern yourself about registers I, R, PC and SP yet.

The single-letter registers are 8 bits in size, so they can store any number from 0 to 255. Since this is oftentimes inadequate, they can be combined into four register pairs: AF BC DE HL. These, along with IX and IY, are 16-bit, and can store a number in the range 0 to 65535.

These registers are general purpose, to a point. What I mean by that is that you can usually use whichever register you want, but many times you are forced to, or it's just better to, use a specific one. For example, only the HL, IX and IY registers can be used for indirect memory addressing when loading into registers other than A, all 16-bit registers can be used to load to or from an indirectly addressed memory location when loading from or to (respectively) register A.

The special uses of the registers:

8-bit Registers:
* A is also called the &quot;accumulator&quot;. It is the primary register for arithmetic operations and accessing memory. Indeed, it's the only 8-bit register you can use. 
* B is commonly used as an 8-bit counter. 
* C is used when you want to interface with hardware ports.
* F is known as the flags. The bits of this register signify (that is to say they &quot;flag&quot;) whether certain events have occurred. For example, one of the flags (bits) reports if the accumulator is zero or not. The uses of the flags will be explained at a later day because we have no use for them at this point.
* I is the high byte of the interrupt vector when the processor is in Interrupt Mode 2 (IM 2), the low byte of the vector comes from the data bus and is functionally random. Note that this vector is used to load a value from RAM first, then that address is called. You can only load to and from it using A.
* R is the dynamic RAM refresh register, it increases after every instruction by an amount depending on the instruction. Its contents are pseudo random. You can only load to and from it using A.

The two bytes of all 16-bit registers can be used separately as well.

16-bit Registers:
* AF is only used in pushes and pops.
* HL has two purposes. One, it is like the 16-bit equivalent of the accumulator, i.e. it is used for 16-bit arithmetic. Two, it stores the '''h'''igh and '''l'''ow bytes of a memory address. 
* BC is used by instructions and code sections that operate on streams of bytes as a '''b'''yte '''c'''ounter. 
* DE holds the address of a memory location that is a '''de'''stination. 
* PC holds the address of the currently executing instruction, you can only change its contents with jumps, calls and rets. The only way to load directly to it is 'jp (hl)' you could see this as a 'ld pc,hl'.
* SP is the Stack Pointer, it determines where in RAM values are Pushed and Popped, you can only load to it using HL, and you can only load from it using arithmetic like 'add hl,sp', if HL was zero before the addition it now holds the value of SP.
* IX and IY is a funky li'l registers called the  '''i'''ndex '''r'''egisters. Almost everywhere HL is acceptable, so too is IX and IY. Important to note that using IX and IY results in slower and more inflated code than HL would (approximately double the size and time) because they were not present on the 8080 (the processor the Z80 is based on), so use it only when necessary (usually when HL is tied up). IX and IY can do something special that no other register can though, we'll look at that in due time. 

To store to a register, you use the LD instruction.
 LD destination, source         Stores the value of source into destination.

&lt;center&gt;Valid arguments for LD&lt;/center&gt;

There are many more, but they involve registers you haven't heard of yet.

You obviously have no clue what difference parentheses make for an operand. You'll see shortly.
You can only to/from I and R using A.

Examples:
 LD A, 25       Stores 25 into register A
 LD D, B        Stores the value of register B into register D.
 LD ($8325), A  Stores the value of register A into address $8325 (explained later on).

Some points that should be made clear:

The two operands for LD cannot both be register pairs, excepting SP. You have to load the registers separately:

   ; Since we can't do LD DE, HL...
   LD    D, H
   LD    E, L
   ; But we can do this:
   LD SP,HL
   ; The following instruction effectively loads HL into PC
   JP (HL)

If you use LD with a number that is too big for the register to hold, you will get an error at assembly time. Storing negative numbers, however, is legal, but the number will get &quot;wrapped&quot; to fit. For example, if you assign -1 to A, it will really hold 255. If you assign -2330 to BC, it will really hold 63206. Adding one plus the maximum value the register will hold gives you the value that will be stored. There is a reason for this phenomenon that will be made clear shortly.

An instruction similar to LD but functionally different, is EX. Despite the fact that it is very particular about its operands, it is a very useful instruction. (90% of the time the registers you want to exchange are HL and DE).

 EX DE, HL      Swaps the value of DE with the value of HL.

If you want to swap and other register pair with HL (or an index register) without losing an other register you could do the following (although slow)

 PUSH BC
 EX (SP),HL
 POP BC

Registers F and AF cannot be used as operands for the LD instruction. Actually, these registers can not be operands for ''any'' instruction barring a few.

=Negative Numbers=
Up to this point there has been an implication that registers are only capable of assuming positive values, but in the real world negative numbers are just as common. Fortunately, there are ways to represent negative numbers. In assembly, we can attribute a number as either signed or unsigned. Unsigned means that the number can only take on positive values, signed means that the number can be either positive or negative. It is this concept of signed numbers we need to look at.

It turns out that there are many signed numbering schemes, but the only one we're interested in is called [[w:Two%27s_complement|two's complement]]. When we have a signed value in two's complement, the most significant bit of the number is termed the sign bit and its state determines the sign of the number. The existence of the sign bit naturally imposes a restriction on the number of bits a number may be composed of. With this, the amount of bits at our disposal to represent the number is reduced by one; for a string of eight bits, we can have a numeric range of -128 to +127 in decimal. For a string of sixteen, it's -32768 to 32767, etc.

As to what bearing the state of the sign bit has on the value, it is this: if the sign bit is clear, the value is a positive quantity and is stored normally, as if it were an unsigned number. If the sign bit is set, the value is negative and is stored in two's complement format. To convert a postive number to its negative counterpart, you have two methods, either of which you can choose based on convenience.

# Calculate zero minus the number (like negative numbers in the Real World). If you're confused how to do this, you can consider 0 and 256 (or 65536 if appropriate) to be the same number. Therefore, -6 would be 256 - 6 or 250: %11111010.
# Flip the state of every bit, and add one. Therefore, -6 would be %11111001 + 1 or %11111010. 

There is one special case of two's complement where negation fails, and that is when you try to negate the smallest negative value:

      %10000000        -128
      %01111111        Invert all bits
      %10000000        Add one (=-128)

Of course -(-128) isn't -128, but the value +128 cannot be represented in two's complement with just eight bits, so the smallest negative value can never be negated.

There is an instruction to automate two's complement:
NEG 	Calculates the two's complement of the accumulator.
I'm sure you find the theory wonderfully engrossing, but what you're probably interested in is how the CPU handles the difference between unsigned and signed numbers. The answer is, it doesn't. You see, the beauty of two's complement is that if we add or subtract two numbers, the result will be valid for both signed and unsigned values:

                     unsigned        signed
        %00110010           5             5
      + %11001110       + 206          + -5
      %1 00000000         256             0   (Disqualify ninth bit)

This phenomenon was not lost on the makers of the Z80. You could use the same hardware for adding signed numbers as unsigned numbers only with two's complement, and less hardware means a cheaper chip (true, nowadays you can get a fistful of Z80s for fifty cents, but back in 1975 it was a big deal, just look at the 6502).

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

The Baroque Period spans from 1600 to 1750. During this time there were increases in commercial activity, leading to an increase of power in the middle class, which ultimately lead to the Industrial Revolution. 

Opera was now emerging for the first time, with many opera houses being built. The two 'giants' of the Baroque era were Bach and Handel.

Bach's death in 1750 marked the end of the Baroque period. Other main composers of this period were Monteverdi, Purcell, Vivaldi, Corelli, Telemann, and Rameau.

The Baroque era is sub-divided into Early Baroque, Middle Baroque and Late Baroque. The Early Baroque period was between about 1600 and 1660. During this period came the invention of opera – a drama sung to an orchestral accompaniment - and homophonic texture was favored. The Middle Baroque period dates from about 1660 to 1710. Here church modes give way to major and minor chords. Instrumental music becomes very important, and the fully fledged orchestra is now developed. The Late Baroque begins about 1710 and ends circa 1750. Polyphony once more flourishes, most notably of all in the works of Bach.

== Music in Society ==

Music was the main source of entertainment/diversion in the Baroque era. Aristocrats surrounded themselves with concert halls etc…. Music directors were employed by the aristocracy to oversee orchestras, choirs, instruments, music libraries etc… They were highly paid and prestigious positions in Baroque society. Music was a craft passed down over generations, a musician teaching the craft to his son, and he to his son. Commercial opera houses were about and flourishing.

= Musical Styles in the Baroque Era = 

== Mood ==

A Baroque piece expresses only one basic mood, and follows what is termed the ‘doctrine of affect’. Composers used musical language to depict particular affective states, specific rhythms and melodic patterns being associated with each.  Word-painting was especially used to associate what one was playing to certain texts of music, for example, &quot;Primavera&quot; (Spring) within Vivaldi's &quot;Four Seasons.&quot;  The sonnet that precedes each movement describes what the music will be representing (i.e. violins emulating birds, thunderstorms, dogs, etc).

== Rhythm ==

Unity is achieved through rhythmic continuity. The same rhythmic patterns are repeated throughout a Baroque piece of music. Some might think that this repetition would become tedious, but this, however, has the opposite effect, propelling the music forward. The beat is emphasized very strongly, which is a huge leap from the rhythmically free nature of the Medieval Gregorian Chant.

== Melody ==

The Baroque melodies also create a feeling of continuity. The melody was also repeated in the same way as the rhythm. A gradual unraveling, unwinding and expansion of the melody was gradually created as the piece goes along. As a result, melodies of this era tend to lack the kind of symmetry and balance associated with Classical era melodies.

== Dynamics ==

Baroque music uses terraced dynamics. This means that the volume stays the same for a period of time, then there is  a sudden shift to a different dynamic level. There are no gradual changes in dynamics (such as a crescendo or decrescendo). Terraced dynamics were used as the main keyboard instrument was the harpsichord, which could only be played in two modes, either loud (forte) or soft (piano), precluding the ability to accomplish crescendos or decrescendos.

== Texture ==
Textures used in the Baroque period, especially in the early part (c. 1600-1660), were predominantly homophonic, or melody with basso continuo, typical of Baroque music.  In the late Baroque era, German composers such as Telemann, Bach, and Handel experimented with counterpoint and helped to create, in no small degree, Baroque polyphonic music.

== Harmony ==

Chords became increasingly important in the Baroque period. Before then, composers were concerned with the individual beauty of melodic lines, rather than with chords. Chords were previously a mere by-product of the motion of several simultaneously sounding melodic lines. In Baroque, chords become significant in themselves, due to the emphasis on the Bass Voice. The entire structure of the Baroque piece rested on the Bass Voice. This new emphasis on chords and the Bass part results in the most characteristic feature of all Baroque music – the Basso Continuo (alternatively translated as Thoroughbass or Figured Bass).

The Basso Continuo consists of a bass part together with numbers below each note which specify the chord to be played above it. It is played by at least two instruments, usually the organ or harpsichord (to produce the chords) reinforced by a cello or bassoon. The performer was given a great deal of freedom with regards the realization of the figured bass. The Basso Continuo was also used in the early classical period, particularly in some works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, who will be covered in the [[Western Music History/Classical Music|next chapter]].

== Words and Music ==

Word painting was still important, and composers emphasized words through their music.


== Orchestra ==

The orchestra was based on the string instruments, and usually consisted of 10 to 40 instruments. However, there was a very flexible arrangement of instruments. At its nucleus were the basso continuo and upper strings. The use of woodwinds, brass and percussion was variable.

Genres  

Compositions include sets of movements/pieces. A movement is considered an independent piece. The musical genres used during the Baroque era include: opera, oratorio, cantata, suite, sonata, mass, concerto and fugue.

= Important Figures =

=== Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) ===

==== Life ====

Bach came from a very long line of musicians. Each generation learned the musical craft from the previous generation. Bach had twenty children, although only nine survived; of those nine, four became composers. When he was 18 years old he became an organist. The church complained about his dense polyphony and questioned his strange meeting with a maiden in the church (which happened to be his cousin, who he then married). Then started working for the Duke of Weinstad and was promoted, but did not want the promotion, so he was put in jail for a month. He then moved to Cöthen, where he wrote the Brandenburg concertos. He then moved to Leipzig and became municipal director of all four churches. He sent his children to the local university to study. He was completely blind towards the end of his life, only to have regained his sight briefly before his death.

==== Music ====
Bach created masterpieces in every Baroque genre except opera. Instrumental music - especially keyboard works - were prominent in his output.  It was also during the Baroque period that the public  witnessed the emergence of the orchestra. Bach used dense polyphonic textures and rich harmonies. His harmony and counterpoint is still used as a model for music students today. His 'Art of Fugue' displays all resources of fugal writing.

===== Fugues =====

Bach wrote fugues for solo instruments (mainly for keyboard instruments). The fugue is NOT a form, but rather a compositional device, much like a canon or round.  A fugue consists of two items: a subject, or main theme, and an answer.  The answer can be either an exact, or real, repeat of the subject, or it can be a tonal repeat, in which the answer is modulated to another key center (usually the dominant) and contains intervallic modifications in order to make it fit into the new key. 
 
Several methods can be used to modify a fugue subject:
AUGMENTATION (Lengthening the values of the notes), DIMINUTION (Shortening the values of the notes), INVERSION (Inverting the intervals), RETROGRADE (the theme backwards) and STRETTO (Overlapping of voices). 

Another often encountered feature is pedal-point, where the tonic or dominant note (usually in the bass part)is held for long periods of time. One subject is exhaustively exploited.

===== Cantatas =====

The cantata was the principal means of musical expression of the Lutheran service. Most usually it was written for chorus, vocal soloists, organ and small orchestra, and set to a German religious text based on the bible. It was used to reinforced the minister’s sermon, and was generally around 25 minutes in length. It consists of several movements, including  choruses, chorales (hymns), recitatives (sections consisting of melodically intoned narrative), arias and duets. Bach wrote a total of 295 cantatas in his life time. While the opera, which also blossomed during the Baroque era, was a dramatic SECULAR work employing an orchestra along with stage actors, the cantata featured all the opera's elements except that the cantata was sacred.   

Bach's most famous Cantata: Cantata no 140 – “Wachet Auf”. It was based on a chorale tune, written 130 years earlier. This hymn has 3 movements. Bach uses hymn melody in 3 of the 7 movements.

'''1st Movement'''
Opens with orchestral introduction. Uses dotted rhythms, syncopation and rising scale passages. Sopranos enter, sing chorale notes in long note values. There are three layers of sound: 1. Chorale melody in long notes in Soprano voice. 2. Imitative dialogue in shorter notes in lower voices. 3. orchestral accompaniment .

'''4th Movement'''
This is the most famous movement. Arranged as a chorale prelude for organ later on in Bach’s life. Thee are two contrasting melodies against each other. Chorale tune moves in faster rhythmic values than in the 1st movement, sung against the string’s counter-melody.

'''7th Movement'''
This movement rounds off the cantata. For first time, all voices and instruments are used. The chorale is set in a homophonic texture for four voices with the instruments doubling. The chorale is presented as a continuous melody with full harmony and regular rhythms.

===== Concerto Grosso =====

The Concerto Grosso was an very important genre in late Baroque in orchestral form. It was written for small groups of soloists (between two and four) put against the orchestra – called the tutti. It standardly comprises three movements : 1st: fast (dramatic); 2nd: slow (lyrical); 3rd: dance-like; 1st and 3rd movements use ritornello form, which is based on alternation between tutti and solo sections.

The main theme is always presented by the tutti. It returns in different keys (possibly only fragments). Bach wrote many Concerti Grossi, e.g., the six Brandenburg Concertos.

=== Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048 ===
This is arguably the most famous of all the Brandenburg concertos. This is with out a doubt a great piece for an intermediate orchestra. The outer of the three movements are in ritornello form.  The concerto's first movement is easily recognizable and associated with Bach.  Surprisingly, the second movement consists of only two chords that make up a cadence, which leads to the final movement in 3/4 meter.

=== Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major, BWV 1050 ===

The Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 uses a string orchestra and group of soloists, which are the flute, violin, and harpsichord. It comprises three movements: The 1st movement - Allegro (lively) - makes use of a continuous flow of rapid notes, alternating between soloists and tutti. The recurring tutti section is louder and longer than the intervening soloist sections, which are mainly marked piano and use the flute to add a new tone-color (timbre). Their music is brilliant and more polyphonic than the tutti refrain, and new material is presented in them. Tension is built up during each soloist section, which anticipates the tutti’s next return.  There is a vast cadenza for solo harpsichord towards the end, demonstrating this tension-building and eventual relief, and thus the formal scheme of the concerto grosso, as a tour de force.


'''''Note : A Cadenza is a passage which displays virtuoso brilliance.'''''

The 2nd movement is slow, in the relative minor (B minor) and much quieter. It uses only the three solo instruments, and a cello, which duplicates the bass line of the harpsichord. The harpsichord has both an accompanying role as well as a solo role. There is a serious mood throughout. The 3rd movement is dance-like and makes use of an ABA form (maj|min|maj – ternary form). It opens like a fugue, with plentiful contrapuntal imitation. The main theme is introduced by violins and imitated by the flutes and harpsichord. In the B section, a new, lyrical theme is introduced.

=== Antonio Vivaldi (1678 – 1741) ===

Vivaldi was an Italian composer born in Venice. His father was a violinist in St. Marks’s cathedral. Vivaldi is best known for his 400 concerto grossi and solo concerti. In particular, he exploited the resources of the violin. His solo concertos include instruments like piccolo, flute, cello, bassoon, and mandolin.  He also composed many operas, many of them lost.  Despite being known for his concerti today, in his own time he was known largely for his operas (indeed, he was the most performed composer in Venetian theaters from 1713 to 1719). 

==== The Four Seasons ====

His most famous work is a set of concertos for solo violin with string orchestra. Each concerto depicts a season, and each concerto is prefaced by a sonnet. These concerti are programmatic / narrative in nature. The “Spring” concerto is arguably the most famous of the Four Seasons. It consists of three movements (fast | slow | fast), and makes use of terraced dynamics and tone painting; e.g. high trills to imitate bird chirps, tremolos to depict thunder and lightning, and soft running notes depict a stream. There is a Ritornello theme.

== Opera in the early Baroque Era ==

The Baroque era invented opera. &quot;Opera&quot; can be simply defined as a drama, set to an orchestral accompaniment. It originated in the courts of kings and princes, and does not deal with the ordinary and mundane, but rather deals with the spectacular and the wonderful. An opera is the joint effort between a composer and a librettist (dramatist). The Libretto is the text, which is set to music by composer(s). Some operas are serious, comic or a mixture of both, and may contain spoken dialog, but most are sung entirely. They can consist of one to five acts
subdivided into scenes. The main attraction is the aria, which is a song for solo voice set to orchestral accompaniment. The Opera may include recitatives, where the vocal line imitates the rhythms and pitch fluctuation of speech. Words are sung quickly on repeated notes, and are not melodic. Also, duets, trios, quintets etc... are used. The Chorus is important, as it generates atmosphere, and makes comments on the actions. Dance may be included. Most operas open with an overture or prelude, which is purely an orchestral composition.

Opera was born in Italy. Prepared by musical discussions between a group of nobles, poets and composers, which met regularly in Florence around 1575, and were known as the Camerata (Translated : “Fellowship” or “Committee”).  They included Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo. The Camerata wanted a new vocal style based on the music of ancient Greek tragedy. These Grecian dramas were sung in a style midway between melody and speech. They wanted vocal lines to be speech-like. This speech-like style became known as recitative. The earliest opera that has survived is “Euridice” by Jacopo Peri (1561-1633). The first-known great opera is “Orfeo” by Monteverdi. It was written for the court of the Gonzago family in Manua and based on Greek myth. The first commercial opera house, opened in Venice in 1637, which was one of the factors which caused Venice to became a major tourist attraction.

== Claudio Monteverdi (1567 – 1643) ==

Monteverdi was an Italian composer of the Early Baroque, who initially worked for 21 years in the service of the Gonzagas, the ruling family of Mantua. He was later positioned as the director of music at St. Marks in Venice. All of his works involve voices, and include operas, madrigals and church music. He makes use of the basso continuo and other instruments. He wrote 12 operas, of which only 3 are preserved. He is one of the key composers in the transition from Renaissance to Baroque.

=== Orfeo ===

Generally considered to be the first large-scale opera ever composed, 'Orfeo' was written in 1607 by Monteverdi for the Mantuan court. It was a lavish production, including soloists, dancers, chorus and large orchestra of 40 players. Beginning with an orchestral overture, it uses recitatives, arias, duets, choruses and instrumental interludes.

== Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632 - 1687) ==
Lully was an Italian-born French composer.  His birth name was Giovanni Battista Lulli.  He moved to France (where he later became a naturalized citizen) at the age of 14, and was very influential in the development of French opera, the French overture, and ballet.  He composed many in these genres, along with a handful of keyboard works.  He died of an infection caused by his stabbing of a staff into his foot.

== Henry Purcell (1659 - 1695) ==
Purcell was an English composer, born in Westminster, now part of London.  He is best known for his opera '''Dido and Aeneas''', semi-operas, and incidental music.  He also wrote much chamber music and harpsichord suites.

=== Dido and Aeneas ===
This was Purcell's only true opera, based on the Aeneid by the ancient Roman poet Virgil.  In this opera, soldier-of fortune Aeneas falls in love with Dido, queen of Carthage.  Then he deserts her, sailing off to found the city of Rome.  In Virgil's original story, Dido stabs herself with Aeneas's sword, but in Purcell's opera, she dies of a broken heart.  This is the subject of the famous aria &quot;When I am laid in earth.&quot;

== Francois Couperin (1668 - 1733) ==
Couperin was one of the leading French composers of the Baroque era, born in Paris.  Like Bach, he was from a family of musicians and composed no operas.  He wrote a bit of choral and vocal music, but is best known today for his instrumental music, especially his harpsichord works.

== Arcangelo Corelli (1653 - 1713) ==
Corelli was an Italian composer, violinist, and teacher and was very influential to succeeding Baroque composers.  He wrote 48 trio sonatas, 12 sonatas for violin and continuo, and 12 concerti grossi.  Perhaps his most famous composition is the Concerto Grosso in G minor, Op. 6, better known as the &quot;Christmas Concerto&quot;.

== George Frideric Handel (1685 – 1759) ==

Handel studied the organ at the age of 9, and was teaching and composing by the time he was 11. His output consists mainly of English oratorios and some 39 Italian operas, the latter  based on ancient Greek and Roman history and mythology (e.g., 'Julius Caesar'). With the exception of the &quot;Messiah&quot;, stories from the Old Testament form the basis of his oratorios. He also wrote a great deal of instrumental music, ranging from solo harpsichord works and sonatas for small combinations to orchestral concerti grossi and celebratory music (e.g. &quot;The Water Music&quot;)

His music, which embraces both homophonic and polyphonic styles, contains frequent changes of texture and sharp changes of mood, and often shifts between major and minor keys.

== Messiah (1741) ==

The best-known of all oratorios, the 2 ½ hour long &quot;The Messiah&quot; took Handel just 24 days to write, and was first performed in 1742 in Dublin. It consists of three parts. The first part deals with the Messiah’s coming, and uses the New Testament extensively. There is a total of 50 movements in this oratorio. The famous Hallelluja chorus occurs at the end of the 2nd movement (movement no. 44). All movements are contrasting between major and minor keys.

== Georg Philipp Telemann (1681 - 1767) ==
Telemann, a German, was the most famous composer in Europe during his lifetime, over Bach and Handel, both of whom are now, ironically, more highly renowned than Telemann.  He was born in Magdeburg.  He wrote the first of his 40 operas at the age of 12.  Other than operas, Telemann wrote numerous sacred music, but is best known today for his instrumental music.  Among his most notable works is the '''Suite for recorder, strings, and continuo in A minor, TWV 55:a2''', the '''Hamburger Ebb und Fluht, TWV 55:C3''' overture in C major, and the '''Trumpet Concerto in D major, TWV 51:D7'''.

== Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683 - 1764) ==
Like Couperin, Rameau was one of the most famous French composers of the Baroque era.  Besides composing instrumental music, he also composed a handful of ballets, motets, and during the second half of his career, many operas, making him a versatile composer.  Some of his most famous works include '''Pièces de clavecin''', '''Pièces de clavecin en concerts''', and operas such as '''Hippolyte et Aricie''', '''Castor et Pollux''', and '''Zoroastre'''. He also wrote an influential treatise on music theory that paved the way for many developments which followed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Classical era occurred between 1750 and 1820. It was an age of enlightenment, set in motion by the great philosophers Voltaire, Diderot and Rousseau. People of the Classical period believed in reason, moving away from custom. They attacked the privileges of the aristocracy. The four great composers of the Classical Period were Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert.  The latter two made the transition to the succeeding Romantic period.  The first three were drawn to Vienna, and Schubert born there. The middle class was more powerful in the Classical era than before,  now having access to music, music lessons, printed music etc… which used to be a privilege of the aristocracy. Public concerts were now given for the first time.

== Mood ==

There is a much greater variety and contrast in mood, with lots of fluctuation. This is contrasted with Baroque pieces, which convey a single mood according to the &quot;Doctrine of Affection&quot;.

== Rhythm ==

There is now an enormous flexibility of rhythm. Classical pieces contain a wealth of rhythmic patterns, which make use of syncopations, or stresses of the upbeat,  changes in note values etc… In a Baroque piece, few patterns are reiterated throughout. In Classical pieces, there is constant rhythmical change.

== Texture ==

Most Late Baroque music is polyphonic. Classical music moves back towards homophonic textures consisting of melody + accompaniment.

== Melody ==

In contrast the relatively asymmetrical and elaborate melodies of Baroque music, classical era melodies are generally balanced and symmetrical, and often have a question-answer relationship in the cadences.

== Dynamics ==

There is a widespread use of dynamics. With the invention of the piano (pianoforte), crescendos and decrescendos come into widespread use. The music is not restricted to the terraced dynamics typifying that of the Baroque era.

== Harmony ==

The basso continuo, and the figured bass is abandoned in the Classical era, as there were many amateur musicians who could not improvise from the figured bass. Another reason for this was that composers wanted more control over their work. 

Major-minor tonality provides the structural framework for all musical forms and genres.

== Orchestra ==

In Baroque music, the orchestra changes from piece to piece. In the Classical period, there is a standard group of instruments constituting the orchestra:

'''Strings'''

The Strings form the most important group (and still are the foundation of the modern orchestra). The first violins carry main melody. The lower strings play accompaniment.

'''Woodwind'''

The purpose of the Woodwind section is to add contrasting tone colours to the accompaniment and to provide occasional melodic solos.

'''Brass'''

The Brass give power to the music and fill out the harmonies.

'''Percussion'''

Timpani give rhythmic bite and emphasis.

== Forms ==

Classical pieces consist of several movements that contrast each other in character and in tempo. Forms carried over from the Baroque era include the Concerto, Opera and Symphony. The new emerging forms in the Classical era are the String Quartet (four movements - Fast; Slow; Dance-like; Fast), the Sonata (four movements - Fast; Slow; Dance-like; Fast).

Various forms employed in the classical period include: Binary (A | B), and Ternary (A | B | A). Ternary may be used in an individual movement, and often the third movement in a symphony, string quartet, sonata, etc. There was also the Minuet (A | Trio B | Minuet A), for example, the third movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (Mozart). The Rondo form was also employed (A | B | A | C | A, etc.) For example: Mozart’s String Quartets, only found in last movements. The Minuet and Trio (A | B | A), where A – Minuet, B – Trio. Theme and Variation form (A | A1 | A2 | A3 | etc… ) is basically the theme followed by variations,for example, Haydn’s Surprise Symphony, 2nd movement.

The most important new form of the Classical period was sonata form. It can be found in solo form, chamber music, concertos, and symphonies. Sonata form divides a movement into three basic parts:

#'''Exposition:''' The theme or themes of the movement are introduced, often in different keys.
#'''Development:''' The composer experiments with his or her theme(s), changing their keys around or writing variations of them.
#'''Recapitulation:''' The themes are restated in more or less the original form, but are now all in the tonic, i.e. the key of the piece.

Sometimes a composer also uses a slower-paced introduction or an extra concluding passage called a coda.

== Symphony ==

One of the great contributions to the classical era is the symphony. Haydn wrote an amazing 104 symphonies, Mozart wrote over 40, and Beethoven wrote 9 (the first two of which best fit the classical style). The classical symphony lasts between 20 and 45 minutes, consisting usually of four movements:

1st movement : Sonata form

2nd movement : Slow. May use sonata, ternary or theme-and-variation form.

3rd movement : Dance-like. Minuet and Trio form.

4th movement : Brilliant and heroic. May use sonata, rondo or sonata-rondo form.

== Concerto ==

The Concerto is a three-movement work for instrumental soloist (or occasionally two or three soloists) and orchestra. The first movement is always in a lively, brisk tempo. A '''cadenza''' often appears near the end of the first movement, during which the orchestra is silent and the soloist is given an opportunity to demonstrate technical ability. The second movement is generally slow, and any form may be used. the third movement is contrasted from the second and usually quite fast, usually employing rondo form.

The concerto uses a specialized sonata form containing two expositions, the first of which is normally for the orchestra alone, the second for the soloist with the orchestra accompanying.  The concerto lasts between 20 and 45 minutes.

== String Quartet ==

The string quartet is for two violins, viola and cello. It consists of four movements, using the same forms as used in a symphony.

== Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788) ==
During his lifetime, C.P.E. Bach was more famous than his father, Baroque master J.S. Bach.  He is regarded as a key founder of the Classical style and period, and most, if not, all of his compositions have more simplistic techniques that use more emotional power, in contrast to the ornamental Baroque music of his father.  He composed an immense output consisting of keyboard sonatas, concertos, symphonies, oratorios, chamber music, and more.  One of his most well-known pieces is the &quot;Solfeggietto in C minor&quot;.

== Christoph Willibald von Gluck (1714-1787) ==
Gluck was a German composer from Bavaria, known for his contributions to changes in operatic form of the Classical period.  Aside from writing opera, he also wrote ballet suites, chamber music, orchestral music, and other genres, but is most well-known for his operatic reforms.

===Reform of Opera===

====Orfeo ed Euridice====

== Joseph Haydn (1732-1809)==

Haydn is referred to by many scholars as the &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot;. He was born in Austria, and his father made wagon wheels. Haydn incorporates folk tunes in his music which his father sang to him as a child. He was a pioneer in the development of the symphony and the string quartet. Mozart and Beethoven influenced his style, even as did he theirs. He was a master at developing themes, often using contrasts of key, mood, texture, rhythm, dynamics and orchestration. His music contains unexpected pauses and tempo changes. He wrote over 100 symphonies, 68 string quartets, piano sonatas, concerti, operas and masses. His last 12 symphonies are called his &quot;London symphonies&quot;. The London Symphonies each have a nickname, such as “Surprise”; “Clock”; “Military”; “Drum Roll” etc.

'''Trumpet Concerto in Eb maj (1796)'''

His Trumpet Concerto in E flat major was written on a different trumpet to what was around before. It consists of three movements: Fast | Slow | Fast. The third movement uses Rondo Form.

== Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 – 1791) ==

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Austria. He is one of the most versatile of composers in the entire history of music. He wrote masterpieces in all musical forms. All his music has a ‘singing’ quality, even his instrumental melodies seem to grow out of the human voice. His music conveys a feeling of ease, grace, balance and perfect proportion. He created compositions with ease (e.g., writing his last three symphonies in 6 weeks!). He wrote over 600 compositions, all of which were catalogued by Von Köchel (a botanist) in chronological order. Thus, we refer to Mozart’s work by the “K” number, which indicates the chronological position of the work in his output. Many of his concertos were among his finest works; he wrote many for piano, several for violin and for horn, as well as two flute concertos, one bassoon concerto, one clarinet concerto and one oboe concerto. He was a master of opera, with most of his operas being comedies. The Italian operas were sung throughout, whereas the German operas included speech. Some of his better known operas were :The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni &quot;, and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. Additionally, Mozart wrote forty-one symphonies.

'''Mozart’s Concertos'''
The Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major was written during a very productive stage in Mozart’s life. Its three movements stress delicacy and lyricism, rather than orchestral power and virtuosity. Trumpets and timpani are absent from the orchestral setting, whereas the clarinets, flutes and bassoon are highlighted. The first movement has two expositions. The orchestra presents the two themes, which are restated by the piano in the second exposition. The development is based on a new theme, introduced by the orchestra. Towards the end of the movement, there is a cadenza.

== Ludwig Van Beethoven (1770 – 1827) ==

Ludwig van Beethoven's career has 3 phases. His first phase was between 1770 – 1802, during which his music was strongly influenced by Mozart and Haydn. He wrote his first two piano concertos, first two symphonies, string quartets Op.18 and first 10 piano sonatas all during this period. His second phase was between 1802 – 1815. During this stage he was going deaf. He greatly expanded upon existing forms, and infused his music with heroic expression. his works include the Kreutzer Sonata for violin and piano; his only violin concerto; 3rd, 4th and 5th piano concertos and some of his greatest piano sonatas including “Les adieux”, “Waldstein” and “Appassionata”. His third phase was from 1815 – 1827. Now he was totally deaf, leaving him completely isolated from society. He departs substantially from established conventions, both in form and in style. His works include the 9th symphony, the Missa Solemnis, the last piano sonatas and the late string quartets.

Beethoven believed that there was a moral force behind music. He revised and refined his work repeatedly. He used classical forms and techniques but gave them new power and intensity, creating a bridge between classicism and Romanticism. His works convey tension and excitement through syncopations and dissonances. Entailing many contrasts in mood, tiny rhythmic ideas are repeated over and over to create momentum. There is an enormous range of expression in his work: tempo, dynamic and expressive indications are marked far more extensively in his scores than in those of his predecessors. Often he had markings such as “&lt; p”. He uses extremes of pitch far more. He unified the movements of his symphonies, sonatas and string quartets. Often, one movement leads directly into another with out a pause ('''attacca'''). There are also thematic inter-relationships between movements. Many of his movements use sonata form, but the development section and the coda are greatly expanded. He uses the scherzo rather than the minuet for the 3rd movements of his pieces. His scherzos have rapid movement with rhythmic drive. His most famous works are his nine symphonies, which were conceived for large orchestras. In some of them he adds piccolos, trombones and contrabassoon. All instruments play difficult music, and Beethoven was the first composer to make dynamic use of brass instruments within the orchestra. Beethoven's odd numbered symphonies are more forceful, whereas the even numbered symphonies are very calm and lyrical. His Symphony No. 9 is the first up to that time in music history to use a choir, which we hear in the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; finale movement. He wrote 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, five piano concertos, one opera (“Fidelio”), two ballets, one violin concerto, and two masses. He incorporated fugues extensively in his later works.


'''Symphony no.3'''
This symphony was intended to reflect on the life of Napoleon. However, Beethoven scratched out its dedication to Napoleon when he found out the general had invaded Austria. Nicknamed the ''Eroica'' Symphony, it was the longest symphony ever composed at the time of its premiere.


'''Symphony no.5'''
In his Symphony number 5, he unifies all contrasting movements. The first four-note motif is used extensively in first and third movements. The third movement theme reappears in the finale. The last two movements are connected by a bridge. This contrasting element that he retained by employing the motif in all four movements of Symphony no. 5 is known as a cell.

== Franz Schubert (1797-1828) ==
Schubert was a Viennese composer and child prodigy.  His earliest works, like that of his predecessor Beethoven, were in the Classical style.  His output consists of over 600 songs, nine Symphonies, eight completed operas, six masses, and an abundance of piano music, string quartets and other chamber works. His songs embrace a wide spectrum of moods, and his melodies range from simple folk-like tunes to complex lines. He makes use of very rich harmonies and rich accompaniments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Romantic era spans from 1820 A.D. up until 1900 A.D. It can be characterized by the individuality of style, where there is an emphasis of self-expression and individuality in compositional style. The music is generally very programmatic, where the instrumental music depicts a story, idea or a poem - e.g., Smetena’s “The Moldau” depicts scenes along the Moldau River. The programmatic style can also be seen in the titles, which are usually very descriptive. Nationalism becomes important during this era, where composers created music using folk song, history and dances of their homelands.

There is a variety of mood, atmosphere and tone color. The orchestra expanded due to the growing size of concert halls and opera houses, causing an increase in the power of the brass section. The woodwind section takes on new tone colors, with the addition of the contrabassoon, bass clarinet, piccolo and the cor anglais. There are huge technological improvements in musical instruments which made them more musically flexible and accurate. New sounds were now created/used in all instruments. i.e. flutes were required to play in the breathy, lower registers; violins were asked to strike the strings with the wood of the bow – col legno. All instruments were required to play with more virtuosity.

== Harmony ==

In Romanticism, a broader harmonic vocabulary was used, such as chromatic harmonies, adding color to the music. Dissonant, unstable chords where also used more freely. Delayed resolution of dissonances gave an increased feeling of angst. Extensive modulation was now used much more than previously in the Classical era. Because of this extensive modulation, there is less tonal gravity (the centration around one common key).

== Dynamics And Rhythm ==

Romantic music uses a wide range of dynamics from fff (fortississimo:  very, very loud) to ppp (pianississimo:  very, very soft). The range of pitch is expanded. Tempo becomes another tool in the hands of the Romantic composers as indicated by the increased use of accelerandos (speeding up) and ritardandos (slowing down), as well as extensive use of rubato (the bending of tempo/rhythm).

== Forms ==

Composers wrote musical miniatures as well as monumental pieces. Some genres are carried over from classicism, but are more greatly exploited, such as sonatas and symphonies. Additionally, a few new forms are invented.

'''Art Song'''

One of the forms of the Romantic Era is the Art Song. It is standardly a composition for solo voice and piano. The piano accompaniment is an integral element in the piece, and serves as an interpretive partner to the voice, rather than a simplistic accompaniment. Poetry and music are thus intimately fused. The best Art Song composers of the Romantic era include Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. The Art Songs  based on German texts tended to favour the poets Heine and Goethe. The song composers interpret the poems, translating their mood and atmosphere into music. Most songs have a piano introduction and in many cases a postlude.

Types of Art Songs:
'''Strophic''' - The same music is used for each stanza. Like a hymn in structure.
'''Through-composed''' - New music is used for each stanza. Allows music to reflect changing moods in the poem.
'''Song Cycles''' - Contains several art songs, grouped into a set. Often unified by a single story line. i.e. : Schubert's “The Winter Journey”

''''Tone Poem'''

== Beethoven (1770 – 1827) ==

Ludwig van Beethoven's career has 3 phases. His first phase was between 1770 – 1802, during which his music was strongly influenced by Mozart and Haydn. He wrote his first two piano concertos, first two symphonies, string quartets Op.18 and first 10 piano sonatas all during this period. His second phase was between 1802 – 1815.

In some of them he adds piccolos, trombones and contrabassoon. All instruments play difficult music, and the odd-numbered symphonies are more forceful, whereas the even-numbered symphonies are very calm and lyrical. His Symphony No. 9 is the first up to that time in music history to use a choir, which we hear in the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; finale movement. He wrote 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, 5 piano concertos, 1 opera (“Fidelio”), 1 ballet, 1 violin concerto, and 2 masses. He incorporated fugues extensively in his later works.


'''Symphony no.3'''
This symphony was intended to reflect on the life of Napoleon. However, Beethoven scratched out its dedication to Napoleon when he found out the general had invaded Austria. Nicknamed the ''Eroica'' Symphony, it was the longest symphony ever composed at the time of its premiere.


'''Symphony no.5'''

In his Symphony no. 5, he unifies all contrasting movements. The first four-note motif is used extensively in first and third movements. The third movement theme reappears in the finale. The last two movements are connected by a bridge. This contrasting element that he retained by employing the motif in all four movements of Symphony no. 5 is known as a cell.

== Paganini (1782 - 1840) ==

== Weber (1786 - 1826) ==

== Rossini (1792 - 1868) ==

== Donizetti (1797 - 1848) ==

== Mendelssohn (1809 - 1847) ==

== Schumann (1810 – 1856) ==

Schumann was a very conservative composer, whose works are very autobiographical and programmatic in nature. He was the founder of the first musical journal – “The New Journal of Music”. His most famous Art Song is considered to be &quot;In The Lovely Month Of May&quot;, an example of an Art Song which makes use of Strophic form.

== Schubert (1797 – 1828) ==

Schubert was a Viennese composer and child prodigy. His output consists of over 600 songs, nine Symphonies, eight completed operas, six masses, and an abundance of piano music, string quartets and other chamber works. His songs embrace a wide spectrum of moods, and his melodies range from simple folk-like tunes to complex lines. He makes use of very rich harmonies and rich accompaniments.

'''The Erl King'''

'The Erl King' is an Art Song based on a ballad by Goethe. The Poem is in dialog throughout. The story is about a father riding through a storm on horse-back with his sick child in his arms. The boy has visions of the Erl King – a symbol of death. A through-composed setting is used to capture the tension and excitement of the poem. The piano part has a triplet motion, describing the galloping of the horse. The motif in the bass symbolizes the Erl King and death. Schubert makes one singer portray several characters. The ‘boy’ is sung in the high register in a minor key, often with dissonant harmonies (symbolic of his sickness), whereas the ‘father’ sings in the low register, trying to reassure the boy. The ‘Erl King’ sings coy and enticing melodies in the major key. The highlight of the piece is its closing recitative, announcing the father's discovery on reaching home of his son dead in his arms.

== The Symphony ==

During the Romantic era, two groups of Symphony composers arose. The first being the &quot;Conservative&quot; Group, comprising of Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky and Brahms. The second is known as the &quot;Revolutionary&quot; Group, and consists of Berlioz, Liszt, Mahler, and Dvorak.

== Berlioz (1803 – 1869) ==

Berlioz was a French composer, whose work contains abrupt contrasts in dynamics and tempo changes.  He assembled hundreds of musicians in his orchestras to achieve an enormous range of power. He made use of unusual orchestral effects such as col legno, and the combination of bells and brasses. His melodies are long, irregular and asymmetrical. All his works are for orchestra or for orchestra with chorus and vocal soloist, and have a literary program and are dramatic and use new forms.

'''Symphnonie Fantastique, 1830'''

Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique (1830) is a five movement programmatic symphony. A single melody, called the ideé fixe, is used to represent the beloved, and makes an appearance in all movements, unifying the symphony. The theme changes in character throughout the symphony. He makes use of a large and colorful orchestra consisting of bells,  harps, timpani, piccolo, cor anglais, etc… He has the heaviest orchestration in the last two movements which depict the fantastic and the diabolical.

1st movement: slow introduction with 11 tempo changes, followed by the Allegro, in which the ideé fixe is very noble and shy.

2nd movement: A waltz, using ternary form and including the harps.
 
3rd movement: describes a country scene and includes the cor anglais.

4th movement: a march, here the timpani are tuned a 3rd apart.

5th movement: most fantastic. Starts with muted strings. Here the ideé fixe is a witch, and is transformed into a dance tuned decorated by trills. Bells are used, tubas and bassoons intone the Dies Irae, symbolizing eternal damnation. There are contrasting Pizzicato in the strings. The movements ends with a figure in the lower strings. There is a huge crescendo at the end, culminating in a musical nightmare.

== Brahms (1833 – 1897) ==

Brahms was a German composer, influenced by Schumann to a small extent. He created masterpieces in all forms except opera. His output includes four symphonies, two piano concertos, one violin concerto, short piano pieces, many songs (over 200) and a large number of choral pieces.  He was a master of ‘Theme and Variation’ form. Strongly influenced by Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, his music embraces a wide range of moods and uses intricate and dense polyphonic textures. He makes extensive use of imitation, canon and fugue, with intricate rhythmic patterns,  including polyrhythms (various rhythms placed against each other E.g. : 2 against 3, or 3 against 2). Brahms treated tonality with greater freedom whilst adhering to strict, formal classical forms and standards. Each of his 4 movements are arranged in the traditional sequence: Allegro, Slower 2nd, Scherzo and massive finale. He employs extensive modulation throughout. He was very fond of mellow instruments / tone colors such as viola, clarinet and French horn.

'''Symphony IV opus 98'''

1st movement : Sonata form

2nd movement : Slow and lyrical, with a pair of song-like themes.

3rd movement : Scherzo. Incorporates Sonata-rondo from.

4th movement : Theme and Variation Form (Allegro in E min). Consisting of the theme, 30 Variations and a coda. The brasses and woodwinds introduce the theme (consisting of an ascending, eight bar/note melody). Variations embrace a wide range of moods,  and are connected to each other and maintain the themes eight bar form and triple meter. In variations 1 – 3, the theme is presented in the top or middle parts. In variations 4 – 11, the theme is presented in the bass. In variations 12 onwards the theme is presented in the top, middle or bass parts. This movement uses an overall ternary form:

A

Theme, then Variations 1 – 11 in a Minor key. Very Forceful.

B

Variations 12 – 15 in a Major key with a slower tempo and more relaxed.

A

Variations 16 – 13 with a quick tempo in a minor key followed by the Coda.

== Liszt (1811 – 1886) ==

Liszt wrote very controversial music. His output consists mainly of piano compositions. He found new and exciting  ways to exploit the piano. He uses an enormous range of dynamics, reminiscent of Beethoven's symphonic compositions. Pianists are required to play rapid octaves and daring leaps. He transcribed many operas and symphonies for the piano. He is said to have created the symphonic poem, a one movement orchestral composition, based on a literary or pictorial idea. A single musical idea recurs throughout the work and its character is transformed. Similar in nature to the idée fixe utilized by Berlioz. Many of Liszt’s compositions deal with the devil or death. He makes constant changes of tempo and mood in his pieces.

'''Transendental Etude no.10 in F min'''

Uses ABA / ternary form, as well as the inclusion of a Coda. The B section is more lyrical and in a higher register, and there is constant contrast between brilliant virtuosity and melodic ideas, which occur throughout the movement.

== Chopin, Frederic (1810 – 1849) ==

Frederic Chopin wrote relatively few works, but almost all of them remain in the pianist’s repertory today. Most of his music are short, musical miniatures, which evoke a variety of moods. Even his virtuoso passages are melodic. His music is nationalistic, and expresses his love of Poland (his home country) through his many Mazurkas and Polonaises. Chopin does not use literary titles or programs in his music, but rather, his poetic effects are created by the exploitation of the pedal. All of his harmonies blend together in a rich fashion.

'''“Revolutionary” Etude no.12 Opus 10 (1831)'''

This etude is inspired by the Russian Invasion of Warsaw. It is essentially a study which develops speed and endurance in the pianist’s left hand. The left hand plays rapid scale passages throughout. The piece begins with high, dissonant chords, and rushing passages.

== Verdi (1813 – 1901) ==

Verdi's music has a great variety of moods. His operas are fast moving, and involve characters who are quickly plunged into extremes of hatred, love, jealousy and fear. The vocal melody is the soul of Verdi’s opera. He uses many trios, duets and quartets in which the emotions of each character are clearly depicted. Verdi’s last three operas are among his greatest: Aida, Falstaff and Otello.

== Wagner (1813 - 1883) ==
 
Wagner was one of the few great composers who was able to write his own librettos, which he based on legends and myths such as the story of Tristan and Isolde and of the Norse gods. He called his works “music dramas” or “Universal Art Works” (gesamtkunstwerk in German). Wagner shifted the musical gravity from the voice to the orchestra, and so expands his orchestra, which is treated symphonically. His orchestral interludes were used to describe the present scene. He exploited the power of brass instruments fully and even invented a new instrument, the Wagner tuba. He used leitmotifs, which are a recurring, short musical idea associated with a person or object in the drama. He varied and transformed these leitmotifs to convey changes of character, and these leitmotifs are what unify Wagner’s operas. He uses chromatic and dissonant harmonies, and frequent modulation, but avoids resolution of dissonances, leading to the breaking down of tonality.

'''The Ring'''

&quot;The Ring&quot; (AKA ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'') is Wagner's most famous work. It is a widely performed sequence of 4 operas /dramas, arranged in a gigantic cycle.

== Strauss (1825 - 1899) ==

== Puccini (1858 - 1924) ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PHP tags: ==

=== '''&lt;?php [code] ?&gt;''' ===

* Enclose php code

* Can be configured in the php.ini to be &lt;? ?&gt;, &lt;script language=&quot;php&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; etc.

* Embedded in normal HTML code

* Within php tags, statements are separated by a ; (generally also followed by a new line).

Example: 

 &lt;?php
 print “Hello World\n”;
 $date = date(“Y-m-d H:i:s”);
 print “The date and time at the moment is $date”;
 ?&gt;

=== '''&lt;?=''' ===


* Used if you just want to print out the value of a variable

Example:  
 &lt;?php
 $name = &quot;Bobby&quot;;
 ?&gt;
 
 &lt;?=$name?&gt;
Which will output ''Bobby''.

Example:
 &lt;?=date(“Y-m-d H:i:s”)?&gt; 

Which will output something like ''2005-11-09 19:40:05''.

== Commenting ==

==='''#'''===

* Comments out one line

* Example:
 echo “Hello”; # Everything from the hash is commented out

* Example:
 # This entire line is commented out

==='''//'''===

* Works just as in Java and JavaScript

* Same function as '''#'''

==='''/* (text) */'''===

* Comments out everything between the /* and the */

* Example: 
 /*All of this is
 commented out.
 Even this line!*/

== Variables ==

➢ Variables in PHP are denoted by the $ prefix.

e.g. : $a = “Hello World”; # this assigns the string “Hello World” to $a.

e.g. : $b = “$a, I'm Ralfe”; # this assigns “Hello World, I'm Ralfe” to $b.

e.g. : $b = $a.”, I'm Ralfe”; # exactly the same as the previous example.


➢ PHP supports dynamic variables.

e.g. : $c = “response”;

e.g. : $$c = “Hello Ralfe”; # this assigns “Hello Ralfe” to $response.


➢ PHP variables do not have to be declared ahead of time, nor do they require a type
definition. PHP handles all data type conversions.

e.g. : $a = 4;

e.g. : $b = 12;

e.g. : print “The value of a is $a.”; # Uses a as a String.

e.g. : $c = $a + $b; # $a is now used as an Integer again.


➢ PHP supports boolean variables, which can be assigned either a one or a zero, or a
true or false.

e.g. : $a = true;

e.g. : $b = 1;

e.g. : # $a and $b are the same thing!

e.g. : $c = false;

e.g. : $d = 0;

e.g. : # $c and $d are the same thing!

== Operators ==

➢ Arithmetic Operators

$a = 4;

$b = 2;

// Addition: $a + $b = 6

// Subtraction: $a - $b = 2

// Multiplication: $a * $b = 8

// Division: $a / $b = 2

// Modulus: $a % $b = 0

// Increment: $a++

// Decrement: $a--


➢ Assignment Operators

$a = 4;

$b = $a;

// $b = 4;


➢ Comparison Operators

$a == $b // test if two values are equal

$a != $b // test if two values are not equal

$a &lt; $b // test if the first value is less than the second

$a &gt; $b // test if the first value is greater than the second

$a &lt;= $b // test if the first value is less than or equal to the second

$a &gt;= $b // test if the first value is greater than or equal to the second

== Concatenation ==


$a = “Fill the halls “;

$b = “with poisoned ivy...“;

$c = $a . $b; # the '.' operator concatenates two variables.

// $c = “Fill the halls with poisoned ivy...”

== Arrays ==

PHP supports both numerically indexed arrays as well as associative arrays.

$a = array(1, 2, 3, 4);

// $a[0] = 1;

// $a[1] = 2;

// $a[2] = 3;

// $a[3] = 4;

$b = array(“name” =&gt; ”Fred”, “age” =&gt; 30);

// $b['name'] = “Fred”;

// $b['age'] = 30;

== Decision and Loop Statements ==

'''IF THEN ELSE statement'''

 $a = 1;
 $b = 10;
 
 if ($a &gt; $b) {
    echo &quot;a is greater than b&quot;;
 }
 else if ($a == $b) {
    echo &quot;a is equal to b&quot;;
 }
 else {
    echo &quot;a is not greater than b&quot;;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // a is not greater than b
 

'''SWITCH statement'''

 $a = 100;
 
 switch($a) {
    case(10):
       echo &quot;The value is 10&quot;;
       break;
 
    case(100):
       echo &quot;The value is 100&quot;;
       break;
 
    case(1000):
       echo &quot;The value is 1000&quot;;
       break;
 
    default:
       echo &quot;Are you sure you entered in a valid number?&quot;;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // The value is 100


'''FOR statement'''

 for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
    # initialize $i ; while condition ; increment statement
    echo $i;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // 0123456789


'''FOREACH statement'''

 $a = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 
 foreach ($a as $val){
    echo $val;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // 12345


'''WHILE statement'''

 while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){
    print $row[0];
 }


'''DO WHILE statement'''

 $i = 0;
 # Note that it might seem that $i will
 do{
    # never be printed to the screen, but
    print $i;
    # a DO WHILE loop always executes at
 } while ($i &gt;0);
 # least once!

== Functions ==

 function square_number($number) {
    return ($number * $number);
 }
 
 $answer = square_number(10);
 echo &quot;The answer is {$answer}&quot;;
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // The answer is 100

== Classes ==

 class dog {
    var $name;
    
    function dog($name){
       $this-&gt;name = $name;
    }
    
    function bark(){
       echo &quot;Woof! Woof!&quot;;
    }
    
    function who_am_i() {
       echo &quot;My name is {$this-&gt;name), and I am a dog&quot;;
    }
 }
 
 $the_dog = new dog(&quot;John&quot;);
 $the_dog-&gt;who_am_i();
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // My name is John, and I am a dog

      <text xml:space="preserve">Section 18 of ICTA sets out the charge to tax under '''Schedule D'''.

Subsection (1) raises the charge to tax in respect of:

*Annual profits or gains arising or accruing on worldwide income from property of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|UK residents]]
*Annual profits or gains on worldwide trading income for UK residents
*Annual profits or gains on UK trading income or income from property
*All interest of money, annuities and other profits or gains not charged under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] or ITEPA and not specifically exempted from tax.

Subsection (2) provides that the charge under Schedule D happens under different Cases.

Subsection (3) sets out the different Cases. There are different definitions for some of the Cases depending on whether you are looking at income tax or corporation tax. However, subsection (4A) provides that Subsections (1) to (4) only apply to income tax to the extent that they are needed in the application to corporation tax.

Subsection (5) notes that Parts III and IV of ICTA as well as ITTOIA have further related provisions.

==The Cases of Schedule D==

===Case I===

This Case covers tax in respect of any trade carried on in the United Kingdom or elsewhere but not contained in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]].

===Case II===

This Case covers tax in respect of any profession or vocation not contained in any other Schedule. In practice, it is not thought possible for a company to be charged to tax under Case II.  eah as if this is true

===Case III===

For companies, this Case covers tax from [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legisation/Loan relationship|loan relationships]] charged under this Case by Chapter II of Part IV of FA 1996. It also covers any annuity or other annual payment which is payable in repect of anything other than a loan relationship and which is not a payment under Schedule A. 

For individuals, this Case covers UK interest-like receipts, but in practice this rule only applies insofar as it is relevant for the operation of corporation tax as individuals are taxed under ITEPA.

===Case IV===

This does not apply to companies. For individuals, this Case covers income from overseas securities, but in practice this rule only applies insofar as it is relevant for the operation of corporation tax as individuals are taxed under ITEPA.

===Case V===

This Case covers tax in respect of income arising from posessions out of the UK that are employment, social security or pension income taxed under ITEPA. For companies, it excludes anything falling within Case III.

===Case VI===

This Case covers tax in respect of any annual profits or gains not falling under any other Case and not taxed under Schedule A, or as employment, social security or pension income under ITEPA.

==Further provisions and definitions==

Subsections (3B) to (3E) provide some supplemental provisions.

Subsection (3B) expands the meaning of '''relevant foreign holdings''' to include proceeds of a sale or other realisation of coupons for foreign dividends effected by a UK bank that pays the proceeds over or credits them to an account, and any proceeds of a sale of such coupons in the UK by a person who isn't a bank or another dealer of coupons.

Subsection (3C) defines '''relevant foreign holdings''' for the purposes of this Section to mean non-UK government, public or local authority securities or any share or securities issued by a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Residency|non-UK resident]].

Subsection (3D) defines '''foreign dividends''' essentially to mean payments in respect of relevant foreign holdings.

Subsection (3E) defines [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Bank|bank]] to have the meaning given by [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 840A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 840A of ICTA]]. References in Section 18 to '''coupons''' include, in relation to any foreign dividends, warrants for an bills of exchange purporting to be drawn or made in payment of those dividends.

== [[Programming:PHP &amp; MySQL]] ==
It would be better if you named pages consistently: when you have TOC in [[Programming:PHP &amp; MySQL]] and chapter name is [[PHP &amp; MySQL/PHP Syntax]], chapter won't have automatic link to the TOC. I suggest renaming main book page to [[PHP &amp; MySQL]], it would be shorter. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

== [[Wikibooks:Surgery department]] ==

Hi. The five departments Wikibooks currently has are: natural sciences, social sciences, computing, arts, and miscellaneous, all of which contain bookshelves. Because [[Wikibooks:Surgery department]] contains only four books, all of which are found on [[Wikibooks:Health science bookshelf]], I have redirected the page to that bookshelf. I don't think we should confuse browsers with extra pages. Is this alright? BTW, I'm glad to see someone finally working on [[Orthopaedic Surgery]] again! Thanks and regards, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:18, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

: Yes, the natural sciences bookshelf is really a &quot;miscellaneous natural sciences&quot; bookshelf. Math and computer science, which are under the same department, are not natural sciences at all. In fact, some don't even consider math a science. Engineering and health science would both fit better under an applied sciences department. And this is only one department! The others suffer from similar problems. I have proposed a more sensible organization [[Wikibooks_talk:All_bookshelves#Reorganization|here]], based on [[w:list of academic disciplines]], but unfortunately it hasn't gotten much attention. Good luck on your books, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:25, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

:Yes [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]], it appears that you have been working hard with a few others to get the whole bookshelf arranged. At the moment I don't have anything specific to suggest. I presume it will take a while to get the best/working combination. Don't be disappointed. I am sure you will get it right, especially when there are more books on the shelves! Good luck.
:And thanks for your encouraging words.

I wonder if this is the best way to contact you.  I have some content for the orthopaedic wikibook but am unsure what is the best way to put it on there.  [[User:Openelfar|elfar]] 02:59, 17 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

== lots squares in columns about name and transliteration ==

I see lots square simbols in two colums: name and transliteration.
My o.s. is windows XP

== Where did this come from? ==
i feel like this isn't very clear, even to someone who's studied Arabic.  The image labelled &quot;self-explanatory&quot; isn't at all - why are only half the letters labelled? [[User:The chavi|The chavi]] 00:31, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

I think it's a cop out to say that you won't hear or will hear as a different sound the rest of the letters.  It's important to teach people how to speak the language, and leaving an aspect like this out will cause major trouble for anyone using this as a legitmate resource.

== Agreed: Not clear ==

This article is not very clear at all. The pictures have awkward MSPaint arrows, and need more explanation. The table at the bottom is the best part, but some of the letters show up as boxes. These need to be changed to pictures.

== Alienating the Reader ==

It seems to me that the sentence &quot;just in case you haven't noticed yet, Arabic is written from right to left&quot; sounds arrogant, even if the reader isn't one of those rare individuals who've managed to let that basic fact about their topic of study pass them by. I suggest &quot;Please note that Arabic is written from right to left&quot; or &quot;We wish to remind the reader...&quot; as alternatives. [[User:Dorfl|Dorfl]] 07:07, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General observations ==

I hope you will consider the following criticism as constructive.

As the opening paragraphs of a book, neither the flow nor the content are sufficiently &quot;racy&quot; to capture the attention of a putative student. The traditional opening remarks found in many if not all statistics textbooks refer to the etymology of the word &quot;statistics&quot;. Such discussion is easily understood and gently eases the reader into the subject matter.

The reasons for doing statistical studies are much more varied than garnering biometrics from large animals, and at the very least a selection of contrasting applications should be included in the book's opening preamble.

The English is not sufficiently straightforward in places to allow smooth reading of the text. By this I mean that one has to pause periodically and work out what the author intended to say.   J.Morgan. 6 Feb 2006

=An Outline=

I think it would be best if we came up with a good general outline for a &quot;What is Statistics?&quot; section. It would give us a clear train of thought from beginning to end, improve the flow of the section, and address any overall issues we may have with the section. I am just throwing out a first draft, please edit as necessary as we transition the actual content to match the outline.

Additionally, it would be a good idea to think about the questions which might be asked in a quiz on this section. Here are some possible questions:

*&quot;From where do we get the word ''statistics''?&quot;
*&quot;Who invented the term &quot;standard deviation&quot;?&quot;
*&quot;I give you a list of numbers and ask for their sum. This is an example of ___________ statistics.&quot;
*&quot;Name three of the five(/six/seven) central concepts of statistics.&quot;
*&quot;Give a real-world example where it would be appropriate to use statistics.&quot;

===Outline===

*Some Loose Examples
**I always found those first pages in maths textbooks which laid out one or two real-world examples were very helpful in alleviating the more numbers-heavy aspects of the rest of the book. It would also be good if these examples covered the gamut of statistical topics (data description, probability, distribution, surveys/samples, correlation/causation, etc.) without too much overlap. They also can provide nice tie-ins to later chapters (&quot;In the opening chapter, we asked how you would conduct a test to determine a drug's effectiveness ...&quot;)
**Medicine: Drug testing = samples, null hypothesis, placebo effect
**Business: Sales data report = mean/median/mode, standard deviation, bar graphs
**Sports: Proposition bet = probability
**Politics: Conducting a poll = sample size, bias, margin of error
**Technology: Widget maker error = tolerance, yield, min-max analysis
*A General Definition
**Again, as this is the general definition contained in the introduction, we should be leery of any attempt to compartmentalize it (&quot;Statistics includes Bayesian statistics, which does such and such, and also Gaussian statistics, and also, and also&quot; ad infinitum), to overgeneralize it (&quot;Statistics is the study of why nothing in life is certain&quot;), and especially to underrepresent it (&quot;Statistics are used a lot in the worlds of business, politics, and technology,&quot; with the implication that no other fields use statistics &quot;a lot.&quot;)
*Etymology
**Does anyone have any interesting stories about the etymology of statistics? Or the history of statistics as it relates to its etymology? When did the word itself come into popular use? I find the fact that its modern derivation is German in origin to be particularly amusing.
*History
**The history should be 4 paragraphs at most, in my opinion, for two reasons. First is that this book, while attempting to encompass many facets of statistics, is more primarily concerned with the mathematical treatment of it - in short, this is not the History of Statistics book. (And there are many good references for its history.) Secondly, most of the concepts to be covered in this book have been discovered and enumerated in the past 200 years, suggesting that the topic's history is not so illustrious.
**Also, these paragraphs should focus less on the details of the concepts, and more on what particular aspects of statistics were being advanced at this time.
***Good Example - &quot;In the 1860s, British scientist '''Francis Galton''' began using statistics to study hereditary traits, and helped form the concept of ''regression'' to more accurately identify and predict the relationships between things.&quot;
**Paragraph 1 - Pre-1600 - Summarize all statistical efforts prior to the modern adoption of statistics in the 17th century. My own personal suggestion would be to focus on the taxation and collection efforts of the ancient world, with a culmination in the [[Domesday Book]].
**Paragraph 2 - 1600-1800, Early efforts to modernize statistics: Graunt, Pascal, Bernoulli, Bayes.
**Paragraph 3 - 1800 - 1900, Gauss, LaPlace, Galton, the bell curve, Social Statistics
**Paragraph 4 - modern day advances, Pearson, Spearman, Fisher, Neyman
**&quot;For additional reading, consider Stephen Stigler's '''Statistics on the Table: The History of Statistical Concepts and Methods'''.&quot;

*Statistics as a subset of mathematics
**By this I mean we should also explain that statistics is a lead in to many modern mathematical concepts: probability, distribution, samples, surveys, the bell curve, estimation, and data analysis. We shouldn't try to get into too many practical applications (that's covered in a later part of the introduction), nor should we get bogged down in definitions or examples. It should be sufficient to say that in answering the question &quot;What is statistics?&quot;, part of the answer is &quot;Statistics is an important part of mathematics.&quot;
*Up Ahead
**Just like it says, telling them what lays ahead within the Introduction chapter. Also, what's the deal with navigation within the Wikibooks? Is there some sort of navigation code available? Because right now all of these sections are just dead ends from the book perspective.[[User:Kthejoker|Kthejoker]] 17:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

Sorry to say this, but the current text is valueless. J. Morgan 6 Feb 2006

The section currently says:

:Some made-up examples of ordinal scales are &lt;0,1,2&gt; representing &lt;peaceful,threatened,at war&gt;, &lt;A,B,C,D&gt; representing &lt;black,brown,yellow,white&gt;, and &lt;-10,-9,-8&gt; representing &lt;circle,pentagon,triangle&gt;. Note that in these examples, the exact difference between [peaceful] from [threatened] was not important in determining that the next rank is [at war]; it is only important that [peaceful] is stronger than [threatened] in the same way that [threatened] is stronger than [at war].

How are the four colours '''''ordinal'''''?  I can't see how they are supposed to be ranked data at all. [[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]] ([[User talk:Jimbotyson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jimbotyson|contribs]]) 11:11, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

I removed the examples about planar objects, colours and peace and war and replaced it with an example of a Likert scale to illustrate the notion of rank.  I think this is clearer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In addition to letting you record your own musical performances (see the next chapter), GarageBand comes stocked with a library of musical building blocks called &quot;loops&quot;. These beats, basslines, hooks, and other assorted bits of music are best taken along with other, more varied sounds that you record yourself, but for the purposes of learning how to use GarageBand, your first project will be composed exclusively from loops.

[[File:Loop_bank.jpg|700px|center]]

# This column is a filter for all the loops. You can click on the buttons to filter the loops out that you want. In this case 'Urban Bass' loops which show up on the right side of the panel.
# In this column you can see if a loop is a midi track or an actual recording. The loops with green icons are midi and the ones with blue icons are actual recordings.
# This column shows the name and also the description of the loop.
# This column shows the original tempo of the loop. When your project is a different tempo, the loop will adjust to it. If the tempos of your project and the loop differ greatly, the loop might not sound very good.
# In this column you can find the key of the loop. In case you do not know the meaning of key, use loops from the same key and they are likely going to sound nice together. Still you can use a mix of keys and this will make your song sound more experimental.
# This column shows the length of the loop in beats.
# You can also use the search function to search for loops.

Very good try for the modern greek language, as is my native language i ll try to help you and correct if you have any mistake ;)

== Infinitive ==

All sources on Greek grammar agree in that the infinitive does not exist in Modern Greek. The Greek word απαρέμφατο for infinitive is used only for ancient Greek. [[User:70.52.2.61|70.52.2.61]] 19:14, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== Accent ==

''Every Greek word has an accent on one syllable'': Enklitic forms, articles, and other short words like και are unstressed. In fact, the accent on από is there for historical reasons, because the word is unstressed. [[User:70.52.2.61|70.52.2.61]] 14:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

Hi 70.52.2.61 -- Thanks very much for your help! I edited the section about constructions with να a little more, to explain the aorist and progressive; I hope I didn't reintroduce any more mistakes :-) --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:14, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

==Introducing the letters==

I think it would be easier to introduce the letters using the capital forms rather than the small ones (or both together).  That way, many more of them look just like Latin letters, and have pretty much the same sounds:  A, E, Z, I, K, M, N, O, T. --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 20:43, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:Hi -- Thanks for your help and suggestions! On this point, however, I disagree with you. Many of the lowercase letters are also immediately recognizable to English speakers, and since writing is almost all lowercase normally, it seems better to me to teach the lowercase letters first.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 07:07, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

==The sound of kappa==

You say that kappa has the same sound as in English.  That is more or less true (though Greek k isn't aspirated) before the sounds a/o/u, but not before e/i, where Greek k is palatalized, almost like kj.  So it is unfortunate that your first few words include και, which doesn't sound much like &quot;keh&quot; in English. If you must have κ in your first line of words, how about κάτω, κότα, άκου? --[[User:Macrakis|Macrakis]] 20:43, 8 February 2006 (UTC)
:Good suggestion -- done! --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 07:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

==Greek words in English==

I've added the comment about 10% to 20% of English words being of greek origin, you can see the Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_words_of_Greek_origin and the ongoing discussion about this issue.

==We need charts==
There should be a section on noun declensions, and how each is declined along and there should be a big chart to describe regular 'ω' verbs and how they are conjugated in each mood, tense, and voice. But I don't know enough modern greek to do it.</text>
