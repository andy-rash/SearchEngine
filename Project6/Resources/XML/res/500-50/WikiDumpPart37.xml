      <text xml:space="preserve">In the 50,000 years since humans successfully settled the world's habitable continents, a long story emerges of environmental stimuli and human response.  Innovation, migration, settlement, development of material culture are likely responses, but result in landscape modification. The modern human world is the culmination of these stimuli-response iterations.  

Earth processes create regions of climate, landforms, soils, vegetation, and other resources.  Variations in human population distributions coincide with all possible permutations of physical environmental factors.  These permutations are not randomly distributed. A property of geographical distributions is that similarity amongst features is directly related to their proximity.  

Thus human population distribution is not random.  It is the result of human exploration and expansion to lands suitable for supporting a population.  Conversely stated, it is the slow culmination of individual and group decisions to choose habitats suitable for survival, and secondarily, for comfort.

{{Guide to UNIX:clink|chmod|1|s=changes file mode|bsds=yes|lq=yes|coreutils=81}}

'''chmod''' changes permissions of files. One must be familiar with Unix file permissions to understand this command. There are three permissions: read (&quot;r&quot;), write (&quot;w&quot;), and execute (&quot;x&quot;). There are three sets of permissions: for the owning user of the file (&quot;u&quot;), for the group of the file (&quot;g&quot;), and for other users (&quot;o&quot;).

For a file, &quot;execute&quot; means to run it as a program. For a directory, &quot;execute&quot; permission is required to use anything in that directory tree, so doing anything with &quot;/usr/share/doc/README&quot; requires execute permissions on all of &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/usr&quot;, &quot;/usr/share&quot;, and &quot;/usr/share/doc&quot;.

If you are interested in more advanced topics like the set-uid, set-gid, sticky bits and octal numbers, try reading the FreeBSD manual page at http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi (type &quot;chmod&quot; in the form and submit).

===Options===
  -R recursively change or set permissions on an entire directory tree

We wrote a shell script called &quot;configure&quot;. We make it executable (&quot;+x&quot;) and then execute it as a command. Usually, &quot;+x&quot; is the same as &quot;u+x&quot; or &quot;ug+x&quot;, depending on the status of the ''file mode creation mask''.
 &gt; chmod +x configure
 &gt; ./configure

Only allow the owning user to run &quot;configure&quot;:
 &gt; chmod u+x configure

Deny the group and other users from running &quot;configure&quot;:
 &gt; chmod go-x configure

For all users except the owner (&quot;gw&quot;), disable all access to &quot;~/mail&quot; and &quot;~/private&quot; (&quot;-rwx&quot;). This way, the contents are private and only their owner (or root) can access them.
 &gt; chmod go-rwx ~/mail ~/private

Note that in the previous example, &quot;-R&quot; was not specified. By disabling the execute bit (&quot;-x&quot;), all files inside ~/{mail,private} are protected even if their group and other read bits are enabled. Thus, simply moving some file from inside ~/{mail,private} to some public place like &quot;/tmp&quot; can make the files available to other users again.

The &quot;root&quot; user wants to set up &quot;/usr/local/src&quot; so that all users in group &quot;wsrc&quot; (including &quot;tux&quot;) can create files there. Root will continue to own the directory. This is done by changing the group of &quot;/usr/local/src&quot; to &quot;wsrc&quot; and then by granting to the group (&quot;g&quot;) the read, write, and execute permissions (&quot;+rwx&quot;).
 &gt; chown :wsrc /usr/local/src
 &gt; chmod g+rwx /usr/local/src

All Unix-like systems should allow all users to create temporary files in &quot;/tmp&quot; and &quot;/var/tmp&quot;. Thus root gives everyone (&quot;a&quot;, short for &quot;ugo&quot;) all permissions (&quot;+rwx&quot;) on the files.
 &gt; chmod a+rwx /tmp /var/tmp

The problem with the above is that because all users have write access to /tmp and /var/tmp, every user can delete and rename files, even ones not created by them. For example, &quot;tux&quot; could create &quot;/tmp/socket.3908&quot; and another user could delete it or rename it to &quot;/tmp/garbage&quot;, thus annoying Tux. To keep temporary files safe, we use the ''sticky bit'' called &quot;t&quot;. This limits the deletion and renaming of files in /tmp to root, the owner of /tmp (also root), and the owner of the file (Tux for &quot;/tmp/socket.3908&quot;). It does the same for /var/tmp. So what we should do is:
 &gt; chmod a+rwxt /tmp /var/tmp

== Connectors and non-connectors == 

Words are made of letters of different kinds.
*Letters are split into two groups: connectors and non-connectors
*Every Connector will connect to the next letter in a word.
;Example

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ ـت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـت&lt;/font&gt;

:Notice that &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt; (baa) is connected to the next letter because baa is a connector, not because the next letter is one.

;Another example:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ه &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; م &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; هـ ـتـ ـم &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; هـتـم
&lt;/font&gt;

:Notice that &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ه &lt;/font&gt; is connected to &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt; is connected to &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; م &lt;/font&gt;.

The above examples also show letters that changeform to connect:&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ه&lt;/font&gt; (haa-single form) became&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; هـ &lt;/font&gt;(haa-initial form). They are both the same letter but in different forms so they can be handwritten together. How do we know which form a letter is supposed to take on in a word?

==Connectors only==

When a word has only connector letters, then the following applies:
*The first letter is in the initial form.
*The final letter is in the final form.
*All other letters are in the middle form.

;Example

:So if you had to connect five letters of the letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt; (taa) together...

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;

:...then the first letter would be in the  initial form (i.e. &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; تـ &lt;/font&gt;), the last letter would be in the final form (i.e.&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ـت&lt;/font&gt;). So:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; تـ &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ... &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ـت &lt;/font&gt;

:All other letters would be in the middle form (i.e.&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ـتـ &lt;/font&gt;).

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تـ   ـتـ   ـتـ   ـتـ   ـت &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تــتــتــتــت &lt;/font&gt;

;Another example

: How to write: &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ه &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; م &lt;/font&gt; ? 

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـ &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; (baa  initial form) &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ـهـ &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; (haa middle form) &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ه &lt;/font&gt;

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ـم &lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; (meem final form) &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; م &lt;/font&gt;

:So the word becomes:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ه &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; م &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ  ـهـ  ـم &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـهـم &lt;/font&gt;

:That is how it looks when it is all connected properly and how Arabic words are written.

== With non-connectors ==

These are non-connector: &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ا   د   ذ   ر   ز   و&lt;/font&gt;

*Non-connectors have only two forms
*#Being connected is used if the previous letter is a connector.
*#Unconnected is used otherwise (if the previous letter is a non-connector or there is no previous letter).
*Non-connectors do not connect to letters and so create breaks in words.

In the next examples, an ampersand (&amp;) will be used to show that one letter does not connect to the next one (where the breaks are) in the following example. The breaks always occur directly after the non-connector.

;Example:

:Write in Arabian script: b-b-b-r-b-b

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;

:First find out where the break is:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;

:Do the first part (the part on the right of the ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot;). We know that the first letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;(baa) should be in the  initial form. The last letter is a non-connector. Which form should it be in? Because the letter before it is a connector, this letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ر &lt;/font&gt;(raa) should be in connected form:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ   ـبـ   ـبـ   ـر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـبـبـر &lt;/font&gt;

:This was only the first written part of the word. We have to do the part after the non-connector letter.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ب &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ب &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـ ـب &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; بـب&lt;/font&gt;

:Now, we have to have the parts side by side to make the word.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـبـبـربـب&lt;/font&gt;

:Although there is a break between the letter &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ر&lt;/font&gt; (raa) and the next letter when it is written by hand, when one word in Arabic is typed the space bar is never touched. The letters automatically get connected properly by the computer.

;Another example

:Now let's do an actual Arabic word.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ك &lt;/font&gt;

:First find out where the breaks are:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/font&gt; ك &lt;/font&gt;

:In the first part, we see that the first letter is a connector and is not the only letter, so we know automatically that it should be in  initial form. We noticed that &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ر &lt;/font&gt;is a non-connector. The letter before it (i.e. &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;) is a connector, so&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ر &lt;/font&gt;should be written in connected form.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تـ &lt;font color=silver size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/font&gt; ـر &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; تر&lt;/font&gt;

:The second part is just one letter so it should be written in single form, which it already has:

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ك &lt;font color=gray size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;larr;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt; ك&lt;/font&gt;

:Put them side by side.

:&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ترك&lt;/font&gt; &amp;nbsp; (transliteration: t-r-k)

:This is an Arabic word meaning &quot;he left (something)&quot;. It is pronounced (ta-ra-ka).

With practice, you will be able to write better and better. In the near future, some exercises will be added.

= Inference Rules =

== Overview ==

Inference rules will be formated as in the following example.

: Conditional Elimination (CE)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The name of this inference rule is 'Conditional Elimination', which can be abbreviated as 'CE'.  We can apply this rule if formulae having the forms above the line appear as active lines in the derivation.  These are called the ''antecedent lines'' for this inference.  Applying the rule adds a formula having the form below the line.  This is called the ''consequent line'' for this inference.  The annotation for the newly derived line will be the line numbers of the antecedent lines and the abbreviation 'CE'.

Note.  You might see ''premise line'' and ''conclusion line'' for ''antecedent line'' and ''consequent line''.  You may see other terminology as well.  Most textbooks avoid giving any special terminology here; they just leave it up to the classroom teaching assistant to make it up as they go.

Each sentential connective will have two inference rules, one each of the following types.

* An ''introduction rule''.  The introduction rule for a given connective allows us to derive a formula having the given connective as its main connective.

* An ''elimination rule''.  The elimination rule for a given connective allows us to use a formula already appearing in the derivation having the given connective as its main connective.

Three rules (Negation Introduction, Negation Elimination, and Conditional Introduction) will be deferred to a later page.  These are so-called discharge rules which will be explained when we get to subderivations.

Three rules (Conjunction Elimination, Disjunction Introduction, and Biconditional Elimination) will have two forms each.  We somewhat arbitrarily count the two patterns as forms of the same rule rather than separate rules.

The validity of the inferences on this page can be shown by truth table.

== Inference rules ==

=== Negation ===

Negation Introduction (NI)
: ''Deferred to a later page.''


Negation Elimination (NE)
: ''Deferred to a later page.''

=== Conjunction ===

Conjunction Introduction (KI)
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \ \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \land \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conjunction Introduction traditionally goes by the name ''Adjunction'' or ''Conjunction''.


Conjunction Elimination, Form I (KE)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\varphi \land \psi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Conjunction Elimination, Form II (KE)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\varphi \land \psi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conjunction Elimination traditionally goes by the name ''Simplification''.

=== Disjunction ===

Disjunction Introduction, Form I (DI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \ \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Disjunction Introduction, Form II (DI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \ \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Disjunction Introduction traditionally goes by the name ''Addition''.


Disjunction Elimination (DE)
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \lor \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \chi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\psi \rightarrow \chi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\chi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Disjunction Elimination traditionally goes by the name ''Separation of Cases''.

=== Conditional ===

Conditional Introduction (CI)
: ''Deferred to a later page.''


Conditional Elimination (CE)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Conditional Elimination traditionally goes by the Latin name ''Modus Ponens'' or, less often, by ''Affirming the Antecedent''.

=== Biconditional ===

Biconditional Introduction (BI)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\psi \rightarrow \varphi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Biconditional Elimination, Form I (BE)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Biconditional Elimination, Form II (BE)
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

Inference rules are easy enough to apply.  From the lines

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{S} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{T})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and 

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we can add to a derivation

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The annotation will be the line numbers of (1) and (2) and the abbreviation for Conditional Elimination, namely 'CE'.  The order of the antecedent lines does not matter.  The inference is allowed if (1) appears before (2); it is also allowed if (2) appears before (1).

It must be remembered that inference rules are strictly syntactical.  Semantically obvious variations is not allowed.  It is not allowed, for example, to derive (3) from (1) and

: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, you can get from (1) and (4) to (3) by first deriving

: (5) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: (6) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

by Conjunction Elimination (KE).  Then you can derive (2) by Conjunction Introduction (KI) and finally (3) from (1) and (2) by Conditional Elimination (CE) as before.  Some derivation systems have a rule, often called Tautological Implication, allowing you to derive any tautological consequence of previous lines.  However, this should be seen as an (admittedly useful) abbreviation.  On later pages, we will implement a restricted version of this abbreviation.

It is generally useful to apply break down premises, other assumptions (to be introduced on a later page) by applying elimination rules&amp;mdash;and then continue breaking down the results.  Supposing that is why we applied CE to (1) and (2), it will likely be useful to derive

: (7) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: (8) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T} \rightarrow \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

by applying Biconditional Elimination (BE) to (3).  To further break this down, you might then attempt to derive &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; so that you can apply CE to (7) or (8).

If you know what line you want to derive, you can build it up by applying introduction rules.  That was the strategy for deriving (2) from (5) and (6).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Writing Optimal Exporters and Importers for Blender:Python==
If you are starting out in writing a script, don't take these guidelines too seriously, its worth getting things working and then sight a need for optimization before you begin to look for areas to optimize your script.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you're making a tool for others, keep in mind that they might use it with larger datasets than those you have been testing with. So before releasing it can be good time to try to optimize.

For more generic python performance tips see http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips

==Getting Objects (Exporting/General Blender)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;Blender.Object.Get()&lt;/tt&gt; is often used to get all objects for exporting. This is bad practice since &lt;tt&gt;Object.Get()&lt;/tt&gt; will return objects from every scene in Blender, this is almost never what the user wants and could result in overlapping data, but also could take a long time if the user has 2 or more large scenes consuming a lot of memory.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Instead use &lt;tt&gt;Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getChildren()&lt;/tt&gt; This returns all objects from the current scene.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another alternative is to use &lt;tt&gt;Blender.Object.GetSelected()&lt;/tt&gt; which returns selected objects on visible layers in the current scene.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Getting Mesh data (Exporting Only)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Meshes are not just thin wrappers like most of the other Types in
Blender so you want to avoid &lt;tt&gt;meshObject.getData()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;meshObject.data&lt;/tt&gt; as much as possible, its best practice only calling each mesh data once.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To get the name of the data the object references do not use ob.getData().name
simply to get the name of the object.
Instead use &lt;tt&gt;obj.getData(1)&lt;/tt&gt; ... meaning &lt;tt&gt;obj.getData(1=name_only)&lt;/tt&gt;
this is nice because it works for all data types, its just that
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Note, recently (as of 15/10/05) the addition of the Mesh module (a thin wrapper around Blenders mesh data) means that you can do a &lt;tt&gt;meshObject.getData(mesh=1)&lt;/tt&gt; without the problem NMesh has, however this is new and doesn't support all the NMesh functions.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Use new python functionality mesh.transform() (Exporting Only)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As of Blender 2.37 &lt;tt&gt;nmesh.transform(ob.matrix)&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to transform an NMesh by a 4x4 transformation matrix.
&lt;br&gt;
On my system it is over 100 times faster than transforming each vert's location and normal by a matrix within python. Though the overall speed gained by using this in my obj exporter was about %5.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
make sure that if you are exporting vertex normals add a 1,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;mesh.transfrom(matrix, recalc_normals=1)&lt;/tt&gt;
This avoids un-needed vertex normal transforming.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Beware of python hogging memory. (python generally)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You may ignore this point, for small applications, but I have found that for larger scenes this can become a problem if not allowed for early on.


A List in python (and therefore blender:python) is never deallocated,
however python can re-use the memory whilst the script is running.
Basically making large lists in python and a lot of recursive variable
assignment can leak memory that can only be regained with a restart.
- *If you can- avoid making large lists.

This is Fixed in Python 2.4.1 which will compile with blender.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lists (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
===List Lookup===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Python there are some tricky list functions that save you having to search through the list.
&lt;br&gt;
Even though you're not looping on the list data '''python is''', so you need to be aware of functions that will slow down your script by searching the whole list.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
myList.count(listItem)
myList.index(listItem)
myList.remove(listItem)
if listItem in myList: ...
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
The above functions performs a full loop on the list, so if you can avoid using them on large lists, your script will run faster.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Modifying Lists===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In python we can add and remove from a list, This is slower when lists are modified in length at the start of the list, since all the data after the index of modification needs to be moved up or down 1 place.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course the most simple way to add onto the end of the list is to use &lt;tt&gt;myList.append(listItem)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;myList.extend(someList)&lt;/tt&gt; and the fastest way to remove an item is &lt;tt&gt;myList.pop()&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To use an index you can use &lt;tt&gt;myList.insert(index, listItem)&lt;/tt&gt; and pop also takes indicies for list removal, but these are slower.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes its faster (but more memory hungry) to just rebuild the list.
&lt;br&gt;
Say we want to remove all triangle faces in a list.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rather then
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
fIdx = len(mesh.faces) # Loop backwards
while fIdx: # While the value is not 0
	fIDx -=1

	if len(mesh.faces[fIDx].v) == 3:
		mesh.pop(fIdx) # Remove the tri
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
It is faster to build a new list with list comprehension.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mesh.faces = [f for f in mesh.faces if len(f.v) != 3]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Adding list items===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you have a list that you want to add onto another list, rather then appending in a for loop, use 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;myList.extend([li1, li2...])&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
instead of...
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
for l in someList:
	myList.append(l)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that insert can be used when needed, but it is slower than append especially when inserting at the start of a long list.
&lt;br&gt;This example shows a very suboptimal way of making a reversed list.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
for l in someList:
	myList.insert(0,l)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Removing List Items===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Use &lt;tt&gt;myList.pop(i)&lt;/tt&gt; rather then &lt;tt&gt;myList.remove(listItem)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This requires you to have the index of the list Item but is faster since remove needs to search the list.
&lt;br&gt;
Using pop for removing list items favors a while loops instead of a for loop.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is an example of how to remove items in 1 loop, removing the last items first, which is faster (as explained above)
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
listIndex = len(myList)
while listIndex:
	listIndex -=1
	if myList[listIndex].someTestProperty == 1:
		myList.pop(listIndex)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


A fast way of removing items, where you can mess up the list order, is to swap 2 list items, so the item you remove is always last.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
popIndex = 5

# Swap so the popIndex is last.
myList[-1], myList[popIndex] = myList[popIndex], myList[-1]

# Remove last item (popIndex)
myList.pop()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
When removing many items in a large list this can provide a good speedup.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Avoid Copying Lists===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When passing a list/dictionary to a function, it is better to have the function modify the list rather then returning a new list.
This means python dosn't need to create a new list in memory.
&lt;br&gt;
Functions that modify a list in their place are more efficient then functions that create new lists.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;normalize(vec)&lt;/tt&gt; faster: no re-assignment
...is faster then.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;vec = normalize(vec)&lt;/tt&gt; slower, only use for functions that are used to make new, unlinked lists.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also be note that passing a sliced list makes a copy of the list in python memory eg..
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;foobar(mylist[4:-1])&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If mylist was a large list of floats, a copy could use a lot of extra memory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dictionaries (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;

==Dict Lookup==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you access a dictionary item, '''someDict['foo']''' A lookup is performed, pythons lookups are very fast, but if your are accessing this data in a loop its better to make a variable that can be referenced faster.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
for key in someDict.keys():
...wip
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
=Strings=

==Pathnames (Exporting)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Blender pathnames are not compatible with path names from other generic python modules.
&lt;br&gt;
python native functions don't understand blenders '''&lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;''' as being the current file dir in blender and '''&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;''' to be the current framenumber.
&lt;br&gt;
A common example is where your exporting a scene and want to export the image paths with it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;Blender.sys.expandpath(img.filename)&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Will give you the absolute path, so you can pass the path to functions from other python modules.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Correct string parsing (Import/Exporting)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since many file formats are ASCII, the way you parse/export strings can make a large difference in how fast your program runs.
&lt;br&gt;
When importing strings to make into blender there are a few ways to parse the string.

===Passing String===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Use float(string) rather then eval(string) and if you know the value will be an int then int(string)
float() will work for an int too but its faster if ints are converted as ints.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
===Checking String Start/End===
&lt;blockquote&gt;

If your checking the start of a string for a keyword, use...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
if line.startswith('vert '):
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
...rather then
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
if line[0:5] == 'vert ':
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Using Startswith is slightly faster (about 5%).
&lt;br&gt;
myString.endswith('foobar') can be used for line endings too.
&lt;br&gt;
Also, if your unsure whether the text is upper or lower case use lower or upper string function.
Eg.
&lt;tt&gt;if line.upper().startswith('VERT ')&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writing Strings to a File (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here are 3 ways of joining multiple strings into 1 string for writing
&lt;br&gt;
This really applies to any area of your code that involves a lot of string joining.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pythons string addition.
Dont use if you can help it, especially in the main data writing loop.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
file.write(str1 + ' ' + str2 + ' ' + str3 + '\n')
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
String formatting. Use this when you're writing string data from floats and int's
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
file.write('%s %s %s\n' % (str1, str2, str3))
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Pythons string joining function. To join a list of strings
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
file.write(' '.join([str1, str2, str3, '\n']))
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
join is fastest on many strings, string formatting is quite fast too (better for converting data types).
And string arithmetic is slowest.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=Other=
==Profile your code (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Simply timing sections of your code will point you to the part that needs optimizing.
Eg
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
time1 = Blender.sys.time()

for i in range(10):
	x = i*2

print Blender.sys.time() - time1
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Psyco JIT Compiler (Python General)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A python module called psyco exists that can dynamically compile some of python functions.
Most of the speed gains affect algorithms written in python, so importers and exporters have less to gain from them then scripts that deal with 3d math.

For many scripts, a no brainier way of using psyco is to do a.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import psyco
psyco.full()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Psyco can also profile your code.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import psyco
psyco.profile()
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For scripts to be distributed it is polite to try loading psyco to avoid raising an error.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
try:
	import psyco
	psyco.full()
except:
	print 'For optimal performance on an x86 CPU, install psyco'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that psyco reports to use a lot of system memory, if you run out of ram it may be best not to use psyco.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Use Try/Except Sparingly==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The try function is useful to save time writing code to check a condition,
&lt;br&gt;
However 'try' is about 10 times slower then 'if', so dont use 'try' in areas of your code that execute in a loop that runs many times (1000's or more).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are cases where using 'try' is faster than checking wether the condition will raise an error, so it is worth experimenting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Python Objects==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
===Use &quot;is&quot; instead of &quot;==&quot; ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In some cases &quot;is&quot; can be used instead of &quot;==&quot; for comparison, &quot;is not&quot; for &quot;!=&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;==&quot; Checks whether the 2 variables are the same value, where as &quot;is&quot; tests that the python object is the same, shares the same memory - are both an instance of the same object. (Python Object, not Blender a Object)
&lt;br&gt;
The advantage of using &quot;is&quot; is that its faster since it dosent need to compare as much data.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a benchmark test that compares a python class and a blender vector- one the same and one different.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
from Blender import *

print '\n\nStarting benchmark.'

# Test class
class a:
        pass

class1 = a()
class2 = a()
vec1 = Mathutils.Vector(1,2,3)
vec2 = Mathutils.Vector(1,2,4)

f = 400000

t = sys.time()
for i in range(f):
        class1 is class1
        class1 is class2
        vec1 is vec1
        vec1 is vec2
print ' Is Banchmark %.6f' % (sys.time() - t)


t = sys.time()
for i in range(f):
        class1 == class1
        class1 == class2
        vec1 == vec1
        vec1 == vec2

print ' == Benchmark %.6f' % (sys.time() - t)
print 'Done\n'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
My Computer showed the following results. I should do more tests- but this is representative of other tests.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Starting benchmark.
 Is Banchmark 0.284363
 == Benchmark 3.367173
Done
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The same test with vec1, vec2, class1, class2 as ints and floats.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;is&quot; still faster.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Starting benchmark.
 Is Banchmark 0.272853
 == Benchmark 0.322123
Done
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Logical form ==

We will not try to explain fully what ''logical form'' is.  Both natural languages such as English and logical languages such as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; exhibit logical form.  A primary purpose of a logical language is to make the logical form explicit by having it correspond directly with the grammar.  In the context of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, a logical form is indicated by a metalogical expression containing no sentence letters but containing metalogical variables (in our convention, Greek letters).  A single formula can have several logical forms of varying degrees of explicitness or granularity.  For example, the formula &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the following three logical forms:

: &lt;math&gt;((\phi \land \psi) \rightarrow \chi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\phi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, the first of these is the most explicit or fine-grained.

We say that a formula is an ''instance'' of a logical form.  For example, the formula &lt;math&gt;(\phi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has, among many others, the following instances.

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q^0_0} \lor \mathrm{R^0_0}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Formal semantics ==

The formal semantics for a formal language such as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; goes in two parts.

* Rules for specifying an interpretation.  An ''interpretation'' assigns semantic values to the non-logical symbols of a formal syntax.  The semantics for a formal language will specify what range of vaules can be assigned to which class of non-logical symbols.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has only one class of non-logical symbols, so the rule here is particularly simple.  An interpretation for a sentential language is a ''valuation'', namely an assignment of truth values to sentence letters. In predicate logic, we will encounter interpretations that include other elements in addition to a valuation.

* Rules for assigning semantic values to larger expressions of the language.  For sentential logic, these rules assign a truth value to larger formulae based on truth values assigned to smaller formulae.For more complex syntaxes (such as for predicate logic), values are assigned in a more complex fashion.

An ''extended valuation'' assigns truth values to the molecular formulae of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (or similar sentential language) based on a valuation.  A valuation for sentence letters is extended by a set of rules to cover all formulae.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If an English word has a silent letter, that letter does not count. Think about the sound, not the English spelling when doing this exercise.

==Reference==
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;م &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''m'' ''' in '' '''m'''ap'' and '' '''m'''ai'''m''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ك &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''k'' ''' in ''brea'''k''' '', ''ca'''k'''e'', and ''Ric'''k''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ي &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''j'' ''' in ''f'''j'''ord'' and ''' ''y'' ''' in '' '''y'''ellow'' (not the ''' ''y'' ''' in ''s'''y'''stem'')
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ث &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''th'' ''' in '' '''th'''ink'' and ''ba'''th''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ف &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''f'' ''' in '' '''f'''ate''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ت &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''t'' ''' in '' '''t'''alk'' and ''ba'''t''' ''
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ب &lt;/font&gt;: ''' ''b'' ''' in '' '''b'''reak'' and ''ca'''b''' ''

==Exercise 1==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound that the English word starts with.
examples:

*think &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;   ث&lt;/font&gt;
*face  &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ف&lt;/font&gt;

Begin:

#king
#hate
#father
#hamper
#mass
#mother
#yacht
#matter
#clan
#master
#Yemen
#coat
#match
#foremost
#boot
#first
#taste
#cave
#banner
#third
#mom
#track
#cast
#thistle
#main
#fate
#base
#yes
#captain

==Exercise 2==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound of the English sound that the English word ends in.
Because fate ends in the &quot;t&quot; sound, write &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;(taa) beside the word.
Examples:
*fate  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ت &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*fat  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*bluff &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ف&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

= Jaenisch Gambit =
===3...f5===

:The Jaenisch Gambit, sometimes called the Schliemann Defence, is an attack on the center pawns and generally leads to open and complex play. Accepting the gambit is rare at master level, due to a line which can lead to repetition of position.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: excercise → exercise using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If an English word has a silent letter, that letter does not count. Think about the sound, not the English spelling when doing this exercise.

==Reference==
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;د &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;d&quot;-&quot;data,dog&quot;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ذ &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;dh&quot; sound such as the &quot;th&quot; in &quot;this&quot;,  &quot;there&quot;, and &quot;bathe&quot;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ث &lt;/font&gt;is used to write &quot;th&quot;-&quot;think, bath&quot;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ر &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;r&quot; sound, the Arabic sound is different though (it is a &quot;rolled r&quot; sound).
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ز &lt;/font&gt;is used to write the &quot;z&quot; sound-&quot;zebra, zoo,oz&quot; 
*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ف &lt;/font&gt;is used to write &quot;f&quot;-&quot;fate&quot;

*&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ب &lt;/font&gt;is used to write &quot;b&quot;-&quot;break,cab&quot;

==Excercise 1==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound that the English word starts with.
examples:

*think &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;   ث&lt;/font&gt;
*face  &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ف&lt;/font&gt;

==Excercise 2==
Instructions: Write the Arabic letter that represents the sound of the English sound that the English word ends in.
Because fate end in the &quot;t&quot; sound, write &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ت &lt;/font&gt;(taa) beside the word.
Examples:
*fate  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ت &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*fat  &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; ت&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Achondroplasia is a common nonlethal form of chondrodysplasia. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. De novo mutations cause 75-80% of cases. The mutation rate is estimated to be 0.000014 per gamete per generation. Cardinal features include short stature, rhizomelic shortening of the arms and legs, a disproportionately long trunk, trident hands, midfacial hypoplasia, prominent forehead (frontal bossing), thoracolumbar gibbus, true megalencephaly, and caudal narrowing of the interpedicular spaces.

==Etiology==
Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disease due to mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Most cases are due to sporadic mutations. Advanced paternal age is a risk factor.


In achondroplasia, there is a decrease in endochondral ossification, with a smaller zone of proliferating chondrocytes. Periosteal ossification, however, is not affected.

The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors are very important in cells growth and differentiation. The mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) result in many genetic disease. Achondroplasia is one of the most common forms of human dwarfism; it is also associated with the mutation in the FGFR3. 
The activation of tyrosine kinase receptors is created by two main steps. The first step is the binding of FGFs to their receptors cause the receptors to aggregate, forming adimer. In the second step, the tyrosine kinase is activated by the eggregation from step one; the phosphorylation will occurs between the tyrosine kinase and its neighbors, phosphates are added to tyrosine on the tail of the other polypeptide. The signal will be initiated; the protein is now activated. One tyrosine kinase receptor dimmer will be able to activate ten or more different intracellular proteins simultanteous. There are three main signals. The first one is the activation of the ras G protein and the MAP kinase cascade to signal to the transcription DNA. The second one is the activation of phospholipase C to make the separation of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. The third signal is the phosphorylation of Stat1 transcription and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. In the activation of the FGFRs, heparin has been found to have effects on the biding of FGFs to their receptors. It will help the FGFs binding together as a web and link to their receptors. 
	There are many types of FGFRs in human body and also there will bee many types of FGFRs mutation in our body. In this article, there are three first FGFRs introduced such as: mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3. Mutation in FGFR1 can cause the Pfeiffer Syndrome, a malformation syndrome, leads to the abnormal of skull and facial shape. Mutation in FGFR2 may cause three different type of syndrome such as Crouzon Syndrome, Jackson-Weiss Syndrome and Apert Syndrome. Mutation in FGFR3 can give Achondroplasia or Thanatophoric Dysplasia. The most common forms of achondroplasia are found with a very high percentage (97%) specific to FGFR3 mutation in the transmembrane of the receptors. In a normal condition of the transmembrane region of the protein, Glycine amino acid is found on DNA at the position 380. But in the mutation FGFR3, there is the absence of glycine; and at that location, there is an appearance of arginine. This is the results of a genetic mutation of glycine to arginine. 
	The achondroplasia is caused by the mutation in FGFR3 as the “gained-of-function” mutation because the FGFRs gain their activeness. Usually, the binding of the FGF to the FGFRs will help the FGFRS becoming more active. But in the mutations of FGFRs, the FGFRs are able to be more active without binding to the FGF ligands. The FGFRs has been gain the function of the Stat1 transcription factor and its subsequent translocation into nucleus. This is the third type of signaling. Under the effects of gaining the function of Stat1 transcription factor, the more signaling of this function is the more the cell cycle is limited and inhibited, leads to the cell growth arrest. This is how “gain-of-function-mutation” affects the growth of the affected individual.
	The FGFRs and FGFs relate to achondroplasia as the mutation in FGFR3. Furthermore, the mutation in FGFRs is responsible to many diseases. FGFs and FGFRs have an important position in cell growth and differentiation.

==Clinical Features==
Achondroplasia causes proximal shortening of the limbs, short stature, relatively enlarged head with frontal bossing, and a depressed nasal bridge. The thorax is long and narrow, and is accompanied by thoracolumbar kyphosis. There is tilting of the sacrum with associated exaggeration of the lumbar lordosis. Affected individuals are of normal intelligence. Homozygous mutations are rare, and usually affect children of two affected parents. In this case, the features of the disease are more severe, and usually causes death early in life.


Communicating hydrocephalus and spinal stenosis can occur. 

==Radiologic Findings==
A skeletel survey is useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. Skull films demonstrate a large skull with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small skull base. The vertabral bodies are short and cuboidal, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, a search for a different diagnosis should be entertained.



The diagnosis can be made on by fetal ultrasound by progressive discordance between the femur length and biparietal diameter by age. The trident hand configuration can be seen if the fingers are fully extended.

      <comment>/* Gender */  I corrected the pronunciation transcription for &quot;السيارة&quot; and  &quot;السيارات&quot;. (When the definite article, &quot;ال&quot;, precedes a sun letter, the lam is elided and the sun letter doubled. Thus, &quot;as-saiyaarah&quot;, not &quot;al-saihaarah&quot;.)</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Compact Pronoun Charts==
How the following pronoun charts work:
The numbers before the semicolons indicate person.
1st person is used when you are talking about yourself, 2nd person to someone, and 3rd about someone/something.

The first word, after the number is in the Singular form.
A comma separating two words means the first one of those two words is masculine, the other is feminine.
A semicolon indicates a change in number. After the first comma is the dual and plural forms. If they are different there will be comma separating the dual and plural forms.

Plural forms are reserved for animate objects. Dual forms are not plural forms.
Plural inanimate objects are treated as feminine singular.

The feminine plural form is only used when all members of the group referred to are feminine. The same applies to the dual.

&lt;&lt;Person&gt;&gt;: &lt;&lt;singular&gt;&gt;  ; &lt;&lt;dual&gt;&gt;  ; &lt;&lt;plural&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Question Words:
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مَنْ&lt;/font&gt;
man = who
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;متى&lt;/font&gt;
mataà = when
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;أين&lt;/font&gt;
aina = where
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ماذا&lt;/font&gt;
maadħaa = what (before verb)
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ما&lt;/font&gt;
maa = what (before noun)
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لِماذا&lt;/font&gt;
limaadħaa = why
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كَيفَ&lt;/font&gt;
kaifa = how
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;لِمَن&lt;/font&gt;
li-man = whose
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;كَمْ&lt;/font&gt;
kam = how many/how much

&lt;br&gt;
Subject Pronouns:&lt;br&gt;
1: anâ ; nahžnu&lt;br&gt;
2: anta, anti ; antumaa ; antum, antunna&lt;br&gt;
3: huwa, hiya ; humaa,humaa ; hum,hunna&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ArSubjPronouns.gif|Subject Pronouns]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Possessive Adjectives are always suffixed to a noun:&lt;br&gt;
1: iî/-ya ; -naa&lt;br&gt;
2: -ka,-ki ; -kumaa ; -kum, -kunna&lt;br&gt;
3: -huú**, -haa ; -humaa,-humaa ; -hum,-hunna&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ArPossessiveAdj.gif|Possessive Adjective Suffixes]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Object Pronouns suffixed to verbs:&lt;br&gt;
1: -nii ; -naa&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ArObjectPronouns.gif|ArObjectPronouns.gif]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dative:   li + noun Or one of the following pronouns&lt;br&gt;
1: lii/liya ; lanaa&lt;br&gt;
2: laka, laki ; lakumaa ; lakum,lakunna&lt;br&gt;
3: lahuu, lahaa; lahumaa, lahumaa ; lahum, lahunna&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Possessive Pronouns: li + subject pronoun. Sometimes the word ''mulk'' meaning property is used.Sometimes the dative is used as a possessive noun.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Relative pronouns: (In English: which, who, that)&lt;br&gt;
X: Elladħii, Ellatii; ; Elladħiina,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This (default one, in English &quot;that&quot; is default)&lt;br&gt;
X: Haadħaa,Haadħihii; ;Haaŵulaa'i,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That&lt;br&gt;
X: Dħaalika,Tilka ;  ; Ulaaŷika&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The word &quot;inna&quot; usually starts sentences and joins with a pronoun in the following manner. When it doesn't begin a sentence it is best translated as &quot;that&quot;, it has also been translated as &quot;verily&quot;. There is no adequete way to translate it into English.
&lt;br&gt;
The following are sometimes used instead of placing subject pronouns after &quot;inna&quot;.
1: inna-nii (in-nii) ; inna-naa (in-naa)&lt;br&gt;
2: inna-ka,inna-ki ; inna-kumaa ; inna-kum,inna-kunna&lt;br&gt;
3: inna-huu,inna-haa ; inna-humaa,inna-humaa ; inna-hum, inna-hunna&lt;br&gt;
Using the word &quot;in&quot; to mean &quot;inna&quot; is archaic.&lt;br&gt;

The word &quot;anna&quot; works exactly the same way. Just change the &quot;i&quot; to an &quot;a&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The word &quot;laakin&quot;, meaning usually ends like inna when the subject is being mentioned, in which case it becomes &quot;laákinna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(huwa) qaala anna-nii... He said that I...&lt;br&gt;
Laákin-nii...             but I&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following are really close in meaning but the first kind is rarely found.&lt;br&gt;
Inna anâ...     Inna-nii  &lt;br&gt;
Laakin anâ...     Laakinna-nii&lt;br&gt;
===Gender===
*f-female (The pronoun represents a woman, or a girl, or a grammatically feminine word)
*m-masculine (The pronoun represents a man, or a boy, or a grammatically masculine word)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note: Non-human objects, as with the case in Romance Languages, must be either masculine or feminine.  For example &quot;book&quot; (كتاب) is masculine, and so uses the subject pronoun &quot;هو&quot;.  &quot;Library,&quot; (مكتبة) however, is feminine, and so uses the subject pronoun &quot;هي&quot;.  However, ALL non-human plurals take the feminine singular.  (e.g. libraries = هي, books = هي) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
سيارة meaning &quot;car&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
سيارات meaning &quot;cars&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;السيارة --&gt; هي&lt;/font&gt;(as-saiyaarah-&gt;hiya)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;السيارات --&gt; هي&lt;/font&gt;(as-saiyaaraat-&gt;hiya)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
but
أم meaning &quot;mother&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
أمهات meaning &quot;mothers&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;الأم--&gt;هي&lt;/font&gt;(al-um--&gt;hiya)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Septic arthritis is a common destructive arthropathy that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid the significant morbidity that results from the loss of a joint.  Therefore, it should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis of monoarticular disease.  

==Diagnosis==
Traditionally, the diagnosis of septic arthritis was based on clinical assessment and prompt arthrocentesis.  However, the clinical picture may be obscured by multiple confounding factors and a paucity of specific findings especially for the deep joints, i.e. the hip or shoulder.  Imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis of septic arthritis and more importantly, imaging findings suggestive of septic arthritis can direct the clinician to a diagnosis that may not have been considered. 

==Radiologic Findings==
Plain film findings of septic arthritis include: joint effusion, soft tissue swelling, periarticular osteoporosis, loss of joint space, marginal and central erosions and bone ankylosis.  CT is more sensitive than plain films for the detection of early bone destruction and effusion.

The role of MRI in the diagnosis of septic arthritis has been increasing in recent years in an effort to detect this entity earlier.  Findings are usually evident within 24 hours following the onset of infection and include: synovial enhancement, perisynovial edema and joint effusion.  Signal abnormalities in the bone marrow can indicate a concomittant osteomyelitis.  The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the detection of septic arthritis has been reported to be 100% and 77% respectively.

===Is Coding Theory Boring?===

That depends on how you look at it.  Everything in the universe is an encoding of something else.  You can think of color, light, sound, music, teddy bears, your friends and many other things as encodings of energy.

===What is coding theory?===

The key idea is “most efficient”;  this comes up all the time in life.  For instance, &quot;What is the best way to get to work?&quot; or &quot;What is the cheapest lunch?&quot;  These are really asking what is the most efficient path from one point to another, in terms of some way of measuring things.

In this article, it should be remembered the term Information is used in an abstract way.  It can mean information in an ordinary sense; but it can also mean patterns, energy, sound, or a lot of other things.

So coding theory is the study of how to encode information (or behaviour or thought, etc.) in the most efficient way.  It also has to do with methods of deleting noise in the environment, so that the original message can be received clearly.  But this also should be done in the most efficient way.

===The flow of information in the universe===

Energy is constantly being transformed from one form to another. Heat to light, light to heat,
potential to kinetic and so on.  One can think of the entire universe as a computer and the matter as the data.  So then one has a continuous data transformer.  If this seems too restrictive and breeds questions about free will and so on, then one can simply look at the inanimate universe in this way.

===Coding theory in Music, Astronomy, Politics ===

=====Music=====

[[Heinrich Schenker]] is one of the most famous music theorists.  He isn't too well known to the general public because you almost have to be a graduate student in music to understand what he is saying.  It is hoped that others who have studied the theory wont frown wrathfully (like Beethoven) at the oversimplifications in this section.  But hopefully more people will understand it from this point of view.

His main ideas gradually took their present form over the course of his life.  His ideas were still under construction when he passed away, and it is somewhat debatable where they would have led him if he had lived to be very very old.  A reasonable guess is that he would have concluded that all music exists before it is even written.  As waves radiate outward when a stone is dropped into water, so music has a natural immutable form that cannot be changed; it arises from the initial disturbance of sound, just as the waves in the pond do.  So the music is simply playing itself out [[recursively]], and the job of the composer is to find the &quot;sweep of improvisation&quot; that plays out the initial disturbance.

His central concept is the &quot;chord of nature&quot;; he taught that all music arises from and falls back into this chord, just as a feedback version of [[fourier series]] and [[interference pattern]]s arises from and then recedes back into a Chinese gong when it is struck.  The chord itself is based on physics and is well known to scientists.  But here we see an example of coding theory.  That is, if the music is already there, and is simply moving back to equilibrium, then it is really looking for the most efficient path to that chord.  It should not waste any energy, so to speak, and this is what gives it its beauty and natural artistry, just as rain or snow has a natural artistry.  So the most profound music is an encoding of sound information that matches the [[Shannon entropy]].  (There is probability inherent in this in the sense that sound can be thought of as brownian motion, and the waves as global effects of the brownian motion).

Note that there is no error correcting in music though.  If you miss it, you miss it.  It would be interesting to see what Schenker would have said about communication in the presence of lots of other radios playing, horns honking, and noise in general.  Perhaps he would have come up with a theory of Music in the Presence of Noise, just as Shannon did for other types of information.

=====Astronomy=====

One author asked the question &quot;why does Copernicus seem more right than the theorists that went before him?&quot;  Both the [[epicycle]] model and the Copernican model of the solar system can be used to predict the location of the planets.  He concluded that the human race feels that Copernicus is more right because his ideas are simpler - the key is simplicity.  So one could say that he found a more efficient encoding of the information of the solar system, and that the human race is passionate about coding theory without even realizing it!

=====Politics=====

What makes the following political statements powerful (or at least famous)?

       Ich...bin...ein...Berliner! (cheers)
       Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country

One can argue that what gives these statements their force is efficiency of expression;  they are an [[interpolation]] of many feelings, attitudes and perceptions;  they are an efficient encoding of emotional and mental information.

===A modern example: cell phone technology ===

At the time of this writing cell phones are important.  But cellphone text messaging costs money.  So how do you minimize costs?  In some third world nations, people are actually developing elaborate languages for data transmission that help them save money.  For instance, one may encode the message &quot;talk to you at 7 o'clock&quot; as &quot;tk 2 u @ 7&quot; and so on.  This is effective in the situation that [[Claude E. Shannon]] described as Communication Without Noise.  That is, as long as the message is properly received, no harm is done.  But Shannon also stated that because of the presence of noise, some redundancy may be important.  He noted that the English language seems to be about 50% meaningless syntax, letters, phrasing and so on.  He felt that this occurred by the natural function of the mind, the purposeful addition of excessive information that allows for error correction - by the listener or reader.

Animals also encode information efficiently in various ways.  Chirps, squawks, growls, tweets, meows, woofs and even elephants' pounding on the ground in order to communicate with other elephants far away;  these are all examples of encodings of information that attempt to be as efficient as possible.

At this point an interesting question about cellphone technology becomes apparent: Is there one most optimal encoding method for cellphone communication?  In order to answer that effectively, one would have to average all messages sent (in a region for example), then translate the result into binary, then construct a [[stochastic process]] (essentially a computer that sends an average message in terms of probabilities of various patterns occurring) that is essentially equivalent to those messages.  At that point the entropy could be calculated and a matching code developed.  But the lingering problem is this:  given a communication pattern (a stochastic process), how can you generate an efficient encoding scheme?  In summary, one is looking for a [[black box]] that receives a stochastic process and produces a code.

                          average message  ---&gt;  black box ---&gt;  best encoding scheme

===A Powerful Solution: Neural Networks===

One can design a [[neural network]] that can essentially writes programs by itself.  It is possible to train a network on a large number of randomly chosen stochastic processes, while providing an increased reward for producing a more efficient code, and a decreased reward for producing a less efficient code.  In many situations, the entropy can almost certainly be approximated.

Neural networks are interpolations of data.  As they learn the pattern they can be more finely tuned and so on.  However this is not the fun kind of interpolation that may be taught in high school as [[Lagrange interpolation]]; although an interesting game, this method involves usually a single variable and a few data points.  On the other hand, neural networks can be quite intense, in the sense that the number of variables can be very large, and the number of data points can run into the millions.  Therefore, there is no way of using ordinary methods to interpolate that kind of data.

Proponents of [[differential geometry]] have proposed that neural networks should be studied carefully in order to produce a solid mathematical theory that can be used to predict their behaviour exactly in every situation.  But the task is very complex, and almost no hope of achieving the goal exists at the present time.  So the general study remains as more of an experimental science.  In practice however, networks have been used very effectively in many situations and are very intriguing.

===A River of Sound===

When a composer writes a song, he or she may be given the melody first, and then may want to put &quot;chords&quot; to it.  That is, he or she is harmonizing the melody.  Sometimes the person will put a nice chord to the melody at each point, but the chords will not match in the long run.  ''Locally'', the music sounds nice, but ''globally'' it sounds rather ghastly.  Yet when they alter one of the chords, to make it sound nice globally, it takes away from the quality at an unexpected chord somewhere else.  So you end up with a knot that is almost impossible to untangle.

The technical term is The Harmonization of Chorales.  This is a standard part of musical tranining in universities.  One can see how it may take a lot of practice and training to become good at it.  (In the previous paragraph, the concept of several melodies is oversimplified to the concept &quot;chord&quot; in order to make it easier to read).  Can computers be used to solve problems like this?

Yes, but not ordinary computers.  Neural networks have been used a lot during the past decade to harmonize chorales.  They have been very successful and people are putting a lot of time and energy into the study.

So you can see that global harmony is in interpolation of the sound information, in such a way as to maximize the total beauty of the music.  Its a matter of efficiency.  Gradually moving from one point to another with each step instantaneously optimized.  This is exactly how a river flows, maximizing efficiency at each step instantaneously.  (The reader may recall the use of the word Instantaneous from Calculus).

===Computer Programs as Encodings===

If you were going to tell a taxi driver where to go, would you take ten minutes to do so?
Why not just give him the address and go?  It you are going to tell a mechanic what is wrong with your car, why spend days explaining it?  Why not explain it in a single sentence?

In the same way, a program that tells a computer what to do can be very wordy or very precise.  This may make the difference between solving a large-scale programming project and not solving it, and it can make or break a multimillion dollar contract renewal.  The process is essentially summed up as [[numerical analysis]].

The task is to find the most efficient program (in terms of time and/or storage); a study to which people have dedicated their entire careers.  There are many professional journals that deal with nothing else.  But it suggests that there is pre-existing best program in nature, apart from the programmers efforts.  That is, there is an entropy associated with programs, just as there is a predictable pattern of the behaviour of comets or of other entities that occur in nature.

Therefore we are having difficulty in separating the concept of 'problem to be solved' from 'solution of problem'.  Again, they seem to occur as dual objects in nature, just as the behaviours of [[Pluto]] and [[Charon]] are fully dependent on each other.  So a different concept of complexity was developed, and this is known as [[Kolmogorov]]'s complexity.  It says that the information (or light or sound) is the same as the most efficient possible program (or sentence) that generates it.  But we have to find the most efficient program;  so again neural networks can be used as a means of trying to solve the problem.  It is interesting that a technology modeled on the human brain (a computer that exists in nature) should be used to find a solution to problems that occur in nature.

An interesting generalization of the Kolmogorov complexity is the Kolmogorov complexity for an infinite (or perhaps finite) number of parallel processors.  That is, what is the most efficient sentence that generates a pattern with several processors all working at the same time?  One can see how the answer will depend on the total number of processors allowed.

===Geodesics and Galaxies===

What is a [[geodesic]]?  It's just the shortest distance from point A to point B.  But isn't that just a straight line?  If you are working on a flat plane, then it is.  But a flat plane is just the [[limit]] of an infinite sequence of surfaces.  So then what is the shortest distance on those surfaces?  That's exactly the problem, and it can be a very interesting one.

Now of course one can see how this has to do with life.  In every day situations, with many variables and fluctuations of data going on all the time,  the most efficient path from one situation to another situation can be thought of as a geodesic.  And the set of all possible situations can be thought of as a surface.  Therefore the best plan of action would be the most efficient encoding of information.  The poorer the encoding, the less effective the action.  The better the encoding, the more effective the action.  Remember that the more realistic the variables are, the more valuable the encoding will be.

For instance, if a young man wants to meet a certain woman, he doesn't want to spend 30 lifetimes accomplishing it.  Therefore his plan of action can be thought of as a geodesic on the surface of all life situations, and the better he encodes that information, the more valuable his actions will be.

Another example would be a mouse learning to solve a maze.  He has to repeatedly re-encode the information in his mind so that he can improve his actions.  Therefore he is computing a geodesic of the information [[manifold]] of the maze.

Everything in the inanimate universe follows geodesics.  This is how the galaxies rotate and what gives them their power and beauty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is now 11:55 on Wednesday, 10.12.05, the deadline for this assignment. While this section is, for the most part, complete, there are a few holes in the dike.

*references need to be included in the reference page
*internal citations need to be edited to conform with APA conventions
*proofing for typos, grammar, bizarre syntax, and spelling errors
*I fear that I have omitted an important feature of bl: encouraging active learning.

Most depressingly, I'm not sure that I've achieve what I set out to do. Partly this is because there isn't a consensus of what the essential design principles for bl are. Still, I feel that all I have done is assembled a pastiche' from a few articles. I'm not sure that after reading this section a person would know what the guiding principles of bl design are.

I will fix the top stuff tomorrow, even though it is past the deadline, for the sake of acknowledging the work I used if for no other reason. As to the last two, without a major re-write I think I'm stuck with what I put together.

At least I discovered how to create tables in wiki markup.

Final thoughts:
Overall, our product is better than I thought last night. Enthusiastic pruning would help a great deal. The introductory section, Blended Learnig by Design, in particular need some serious thinning. It should be about a quarter of its current state IMHO. I think we also repeat some elements between the sections. This is true across the other chapters I have glanced at. If I was Norma, I'd want to scream if I had to look at another listing of blended learning components (mine included).
All in all, a pretty good effort.

One more thing, is it just me or do citations become almost impossibly fussy? I think I understand the need to document sources with standard conventions but geez, I get tired of pondering whether or not I need a period after this phrase or if proceeding should be cited differently than an electronic article, etc. Done venting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Protestant Reformation ==

The occasion of the outbreak of the Reformation was the sale of indulgences in Germany. It had always been a tenet of the Catholic Church that indulgences remit penalties due to sin after severe repentance and aid of the sacrament of penance. Leo X, in 15l3, being desirous to complete the great temple of Saint Peter's, which Julius II had commenced, granted an indulgence to those who would contribute financial aid for that purpose. A certain Johann Tetzel, to whom the archbishop of Magdeburg had delegated the power of dispensing indulgences in Saxony, was a well-known figure of the realm. He had been inquisitor general of Poland and was also associated with the Dominican monastery at Leipzig, but he carried out his commission in such a way that wrong ideas about the effect of indulgences began to spread among the ignorant and credulous, and many intelligent Christians opposed his methods. Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk and teacher of theology at the University of Wittenberg, was foremost among those who denounced Tetzel, and as this preacher of indulgences appeared at Juterbog in the vicinity of Wittenberg just at the time of the celebration of a yearly festival, when it was customary to post on the church doors bulletins of general interest to the parish, Luther accordingly nailed to the door ninety-five theses, on October 31, 1517, warning the people against such persons as Tetzel and emphasizing the necessity of a penitent heart and a loving spirit in making gifts to the Church. Copies of these theses were widely dessiminated, and all the continent was soon plunged into a tumult of controversy. Luther, meanwhile, devoted himself to further study of the Bible, Church history and canon law, in order to defend the position he had taken, and he drifted further and further from the Church. His public utterances and writings became bolder, and he was soon attacking the entire system and body of teachings of the Church of Rome. He maintained that contrition, confession and absolution were not necessary to secure salvation, denied the infallibility of the councils of the Church and asserted that the Bible was the only foundation of faith and that bishops, priests and formal ritual were wholly unnecessary. Owing to his wide reputation for learning and piety, his opinions on  these subjects influenced a great many people.

At first the pope, Adrian VI, did not regard the matter as of serious import; but at length, being convinced that Luther's influence was becoming dangerous, he urged the Diet of Nuremberg to institute determined action against him. The Diet, however, felt powerless to carry out the desire of the pope, because of the popularity of Luther with a number of the German princes. Frederick the Elector became his great patron. His writings were, however, condemned as heretical, and he himself, if he did not recant his errors in sixty days, was to be seized and sent to Rome to be tried for heresy. Luther publicly burned this communication. In 1521 Luther was summoned by emperor Charles V to appear before the Diet of Worms and was called upon to recant his errors. Refusing to do so, he was conveyed privately to the Wartburg Castle by Frederick, elector of Saxony, where he lived in seclusion for a time and busied himself with the translation of the New Testament into German. In 1524 William Tyndale driven from England for his reformation views sought haven in Germany while translating the New Testament into English. On May 4, 1526, an alliance of the reform-minded princes was formed at Torgau, under the leadership of John (Frederick), the elector of Saxony, and Philip, the landgrave of Hesse. The Catholics formed a counter-alliance at Dessau, which emphasized a disunion that was destined to exercise an influence in every part of the world. The followers of Luther having become so numerous, Philip of Hesse convened a synod at Homburg in October, 1526, to systematize the doctrines and establish a rule of faith. A constitution was there formed which gave an individual congregation power to decide its own ecclesiastical rules. This was adopted in the several Lutheran states, in each of which the chief, or head, of the government was to be supreme in relation to the Church. In addition to John (Frederick) of Saxony and Philip of Hesse the dissenting electors included George of Brandenburg, princes Ernest and Francis of Brunswick-Luneburg, and Wolfgang, prince of Anhalt, together with fourteen imperial cities, the chief of which were Strassburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, and Constance.

Martin Luther had a keen interest in the education of the youth. Included in his ideas about local school systems was the establishment of elementary schools for the instruction of girls. To educate the younger element of the people, Luther wrote a small catechism of a doctrinal character in 1529, which was extensively circulated. The invention of the printing press spread the written works of Luther broadly over Europe and contributed to the rapidity of change. Because of the Islamic threat from Turkish incursions in southern Europe and a desire to allay, if possible, the dissensions which had arisen in relation to questions of an ecclesiastical nature, a diet was held on April 19, 1529, at Spires. The Catholics submitted what they regarded as moderate claims. The state sponsors of Luther’s revolt held out against papal supremacy. A decree was issued from Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire that the religious tolerance instituted in 1526 would be reversed. This led to vigorous protest by the followers of Luther, which was the origin of the name Protestant, referring to states or territories in the religio-political sense. That name has since been applied to Lutherans and other Christian denominations who differ with the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.

'''Actionscript''' is not exhaustive enough to be a book on it's own and schould be merged into to the [[Programming]] book.

This page should be a #REDIRECT.

ActionScript 3 was released as part of Flash CS3 not CS4, also consider talking about the origins of actionscript in relation to javascript as part of ECMA script in the introduction. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:85.195.139.202|85.195.139.202]] ([[User talk:85.195.139.202|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/85.195.139.202|contribs]]) 06:54, 3 April 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Ingredients: ==

* Onions
* Garlic
* Sugar
* Tomatoes, chopped

== Procedure: ==

#Fry onions in olive oil to transparent.  Ensure that the onions don't burn.
#Add lots of chopped garlic.  Again, ensure they don't burn.
#Add a large amount of sugar. Don't caramelise.
#Chop tomatoes and remove any hard parts.
#Add tomatoes to onions and garlic, excess olive oil. 
#Simmer for approximately 4 hours. Lose as much water as possible. (This order isn't logical as the oil prevents evaporation. It would be interesting to simmer and then add the oil at the end, but I've never tried that. )
#Add Salt, pepper, herbes de Provence. Also add Vinegar if you feel like it, but not much.
#Should keep even without refrigeration if you've lost enough water. Traditionally you keep it in unsealed jars and just scoop and throw away any mould on the surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Lisfranc joint, named after a field surgeon in Napoleon's army who described a new technique of forefoot amputation for soldiers with gangrene related to frostbite, defines the boundary between the midfoot and forefoot. The joint can be disrupted traumatically by axial loading, with rotational forces directed either medially or laterally. This classically occurs when patients get their foot caught in something, such as stirrups when horse riding. Disruption of the lisfranc joint is also seen in the Charcot joint in diabetics.

==Clinical Presentation==
The presention of patients with a traumatic lisfranc injury is variable depending on its severity. While some patients will present with obvious physical foot deformities, others may present with only midfoot pain with weight bearing. The typical clinical signs include midfoot plantar echhymosis, midfoot instability, and pain along the TMT joints with motion.

==Anatomy==
The 5 TMT joints form the Lisfranc joint. Important ligaments transverse these joints, critical for support and strength. Ligaments connect the bases of each of the metatarsals to each other, except the first two. There is also an oblique ligament between the medial cuneiform and the base of the 2nd metatarsal. 

==Radiologic Findings==
The initial radiological work-up consists of an AP, lateral, and medial oblique views. If these views fail to demonstrate a lisfranc injury and there is high clinical suspicion, getting full weight bearing views or stress views if the patient is unable to weight bear is essential. A CT scan can also be obtained, which may show an occult injury. 

The following should be considered when evaluating radiographs for a Lisfranc fracture-dislocation:
#Perhaps the most important alignment is along the second metatarsal and second cuneiform. A step-off between these two bones is indicative of a Lisfranc disruption. 
#Malalignment of the fourth metatarsal and cuboid can also be diagnostic of a Lisfranc injury. 
#The medial cuneiform-second metatarsal space should be evaluated for the &quot;fleck sign&quot; indicating avulsion of the Lisfranc ligament. 


&lt;center&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; Lisfranc fracture demonstrating medial dislocation of the 1st metatarsal.
&lt;/center&gt;

==Treatment==
Anatomically stable injuries can be treated conservatively, whereas unstable injuries or malalignment requires surgery. Generally, surgery involves open reduction and fixation with screws across the affected TMT joint(s). Screws are typically left in for 6 months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This chapter describes an implementation of what has been discussed so far.  

The technique used is to intersperse code and discussion.  You should be able to extract the code by simply copying the whole page and commenting out the discussion.

The previous discussion has been at a very high level, implementing it will require both high level and low level coding and also a lot of refinement of our ideas.

The application will consist of a form, some modules and some classes.  We'll begin at the top by creating the user interface of the application, then we will add the code that makes it work piece by piece.  We will find that some of what was said in the previous discussion was incomplete, some of it misleading.  That's what happens in real development.

=User Interface=

I have chosen to implement this program as a ''Multiple Document Interface'' application.  this is usually referred to as a ''MDI'' application.  All this means is that it will be possible to have more than one Jarithmetic document open at the same time in the same instance of the program.  This is the way that most Microsoft Office applications worked in the past.


==fMainform.frm==

Here is a possible main form.  The picture shows more menus than are actually implemented in the first version, implement them as you go along.

[[Image:Visual_Basic_Classic_Jarithmetic_mdi_form.png|MDI form]]

Here is the declaration of the controls on the form.  You can paste this into a text editor and save it as ''fMainForm.frm'' to get started quickly.

The main form is a container for as many documents as the user wants to open.  Each document will be an ''instance'' of ''frmDocument'', see the next section.

Now here is the visible code of the form.  It is quite short as the MDI form doesn't do very much, it mostly just acts as a container for document forms.

The MDI form has a file menu.  When there are no document forms open it is this menu that is active.  When document forms are open the file menu that is shown belongs to the document form but we will still call this method.  When VB creates the mthod for us it will be marked ''Private'', we can change this to ''Public'' as has been done here but it might be cleaner and less confusing to leave it ''Private'' and add a new ''Friend'' method that calls it.
  
When we open a document we must first create a document form to hold it.  Within this program instance of frmDocument represent the document.  The design decision made here is that each time we open a document it will be loaded into a new instance of frmDocument.  This might or might not be appropriate, consider what happens if the user opens the same document twice and edits both.
  
We use the Common Dialog control provided by Microsoft but we could also use a form containing Drive, Folder and File list controls.
    
  Option Explicit ' always use this to ensure that you don't forget to declare variables
  
  
  Public Sub mnuFileOpen_Click()
      
    Dim oForm As frmDocument
    Set oForm = LoadNewDoc
    
    With CommonDialog1
      ' The title should probably say something meaningful about the application and the document 
      .DialogTitle = &quot;Open&quot; type
      .CancelError = False
      .Filter = gsFILE_FILTER
      .ShowOpen
      If Len(.FileName) = 0 Then
        Exit Sub
      End If
      If Not oForm.LoadFile(.FileName) Then
        MsgBox &quot;Could not load file &lt;&quot; &amp; .FileName &amp; &quot;&gt;,&quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;probably couldn't find the zlib.dll.&quot;, _
               vbOKOnly + vbCritical, Title
      End If
    End With
  
  End Sub
  

The ''LoadNewDoc'' function is separated from the ''File Open'' event handler so that it can be used by other callers.

  Public Function LoadNewDoc() As frmDocument
    
    Static lDocumentCount As Long
    lDocumentCount = lDocumentCount + 1
    Set LoadNewDoc = New frmDocument
    LoadNewDoc.Caption = &quot;Document &quot; &amp; lDocumentCount
    LoadNewDoc.Show
  
  End Function
  

When we unload the main form we want to be able to make sure that all the documents are properly cleaned up so we call a function to exit from the application.  We could use the return value to set the ''Cancel'' argument, then the user might be able to stop the shutdown.

  Private Sub MDIForm_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    ExitApplication
  End Sub

==frmDocument.frm==

The document form holds one of our arithmetic documents.  It is not much more complicated than the main form.  However it does define some different menus.  Also because of the way VB6 works it must define all the same menus too, it can't inherit them from the main form.  VB shows the menus defined by the current form unless there is only the MDI form in which case that one is shown.  Again the graphic shows more menus than are actually implemented in this prototype.

Here is the code.  Some of the routines have very little to do with our principal goals of creating a live mathematical document.  This is often the case; as you develop a program you discover small unforeseen problems that need to be solved as you go along in order make the program work properly or simply be comfortable to use.

In VB the ''Tab'' key is used to move the focus from on control to the next but when editing text we usually want to actually insert a ''Tab'' character.  One way to make this happen is to declare an ''Event Handler'' for the ''KeyDown'' event of the ''Rich Text Box''.  This checks to see what the ''ASCII'' code of the key is and directly overwrites the selected characters in the ''Rich Text Box'' to a ''Tab'' character:

  Private Sub rtfbox_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
    If KeyCode = 9 Then
      rtfBox.SelText = vbTab
      KeyCode = 0
    End If    
  End Sub

Loading a file is easy.  Just call the ''LoadFile'' method of the ''Rich Text Box''.  The only complication to take care of is that the user could try tpo pen a document that the ''Rich Text Box'' can't handle.  Here we decide that this is not really an error in the program so we don't raise an error; instead we return a status value: ''True'' if we succeeded, ''false'' if not.

  Public Function LoadFile(rsFile As String) As Boolean
    On Error Resume Next
    rtfBox.LoadFile rsFile
    LoadFile = Err.Number = 0    
  End Function

Here is the method that actually does the work.  Note that all the complicated stuff is in another module.  This is because we can easily amigine cases where we would want to automate these things in which case it might be that we get the text from somewhere else

  Public Sub EvalDoc()
    goEvalDoc.EvalDoc rtfBox
  End Sub

Of course there is no point in having a method to recalculate the document if there is no way of running it so we call it from the ''Data Evaluate'' menu item.  Take a look at the declarations above and see that a short cut key is attached to that menu item (''F9''):

  Public Sub mnuEvaluate_Click()
    EvalDoc
  End Sub

Remember that the main form's menu is not available when this form is active so we call the ''File Open'' event handler of the main form from our own ''file Open'' event handler.  this is why we had to change from ''Private'' to ''Public'' (''Friend'' would have worked too):

  Public Sub mnuFileOpen_Click()
    fMainform.mnuFileOpen_Click
  End Sub

To create a brand new document we must call the ''LoadNewDoc'' method of the main form:

  Public Sub mnuFileNew_Click()
    fMainform.LoadNewDoc
  End Sub

==cEvalDoc.cls==
This class is where a lot of the hard work is done.  The main method, ''EvalDoc'' looks very simple because it simply calls three other functions.  These functions:

*pre-process the document so that it is legal JScript,
*execute the JScript,
*update the document with the results.

The pre-processing step converts macros into JScript functions that store the location of the text to be replaced in a table and also converts matrices into JScript function calls that return arrays.  This makes it practical to assign arrays of values to a variable and deal with the array as a whole instead of each element one at a time.

Here is the header of the class.  In the Visual Basic IDE you can't see this text but you can change the values because they are shown in the properties window.

The actual evaluation of the JScript source code is done by the ''MSScript'' control.  Not sure what the ''Attibute'' is for.

  Public moScriptControl As MSScriptControl.ScriptControl
  Attribute moScriptControl.VB_VarHelpID = -1

The Jscript interpreter only provides the basic functions of JavaScript, any unusual funtions must be provided by us.  We do this by creating an object that provides those functions as methods.

  Private moFunctions As cFunctions

The document evaluator object must be initialized before use.  This means creating an instance of the script control, telling the script control which language will be used and providing a global object that adds extra functions to the interpreter.

  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Set moScriptControl = New MSScriptControl.ScriptControl
    With moScriptControl
      .AllowUI = False
      .Language = &quot;JScript&quot;
      .UseSafeSubset = True
    End With
    Set moFunctions = New cFunctions
    moScriptControl.AddObject &quot;Functions&quot;, moFunctions, True
    Set moFunctions.oScriptControl = moScriptControl
  End Sub

The only public method of this class is ''EvalDoc'' which takes a Rich Text box as its only argument, processes the text it finds in it and puts the answers back in the document.

  Public Sub EvalDoc(ByRef roDoc As RichTextBox)
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
We begin by replacing all the macros we find in the text by JScript function calls that will create the results in the results arrray.

    Dim sScript As String
    sScript = xPreprocess(roDoc.Text)

The results array is a dynamic array that we allow to grow as needed but we don't shrink it because we know that we will evaluate the document again so deallocating the memory would be a waste of time.  So we reinitialize the array by simply setting the count of results to zero.  The counter is also the pointer to the next free slot in the array.

    glResultsCount = 0

Now everything is ready all we have to do is execute the script using the built in ''Eval'' function.

    moScriptControl.Run &quot;eval&quot;, sScript

Lastly, if everything went well, we have to put the answers back into the document.

    xUpdateDisplay roDoc
  
    Exit Sub

Unfortunately things can go wrong so we must take steps to prevent the program crashing.  Problems can occur if the user mis-types a macro by missing out the closing bracket.  There can be ordinary syntax errors in the JScript that the user writes and, of course, the program itself can have bugs.  So we must have an error handler.

  ErrorHandler:
    Select Case Err.Number

If the user mis-typed the macro by omitting the closing bracket this will be noticed by the preprocessor.  In this prototype we handle the problem by selecting the offending text and showing a message box to alert the user.

      Case ChunkNotTerminated
        roDoc.SelStart = xErrData(Err.Description)(0)
        roDoc.SelLength = xErrData(Err.Description)(1)
        MsgBox &quot;Missing #&gt; at end of macro&quot;

If the problem is that the macro is correctly formed but unrecognized we do the same as for a syntactically faulty macro.

      Case UnrecognizedMacro
        roDoc.SelStart = xErrData(Err.Description)(0)
        roDoc.SelLength = xErrData(Err.Description)(1)
        MsgBox &quot;Unrecognized macro, did you mean to display a value?&quot;

Because we cannot predict what errors will occur we end with a catch all clause that notifies the user.  Note the ''.ErrorContextxxx'' properties; these are set by the JScript functions that were written by the preprocessor so that the user can be directed at the part of the document that was being processed when the error was discovered.

      Case Else
        With moFunctions
          .MakeResult Empty, .ErrorContextStart_, _
                      .ErrorContextEnd_ - .ErrorContextStart_, _
                      SourceError
        End With        
    End Select
  
  End Sub

Because Visual basic does not have exceptions we need some way of passing information from the routine that raises an error to the routine that catches it.  One simple way is to package the information into a string and use the description property of the ''Err'' object.  Then when the error is trapped we can fetch the data out of the description using the ''Split'' function.  This little function simply wraps the Split function, partly this is simply to give it a meaningful name but also because it seemed at the beginning that the processing would be more complicated.

  Private Function xErrData(ByRef rsErrDescription As String) As Variant
    xErrData = Split(rsErrDescription, &quot;|&quot;)
  End Function

Before the text of the document can be evaluated by the Script control we must ensure that the text is legal JScript.
We do this by taking a copy of the text in a string, looking for directives and macros and generating appropriate code for them.

Output is handled by calling functions that add variable values to the output list.  These functions need three arguments: the value to be output, the starting point in the text and the length of the text range that is to be replaced.  The user cannot be expected to count lines and maintain these values so a macro is used instead.  The output is placed in the text at the point where the macro appears.  Unlike most macro replacement systems we won't replace the whole macro with the output because then we would lose the placeholder and would not be able to update it.  The macro comprises three parts: intro, body, outro.  The intro and outro stay put in the text but the body is replaced by the new output.  It is important to choose character sequence that cannot occur as a legal sequence in a JavaScript program and is also unlikely to appear in text string.

The sequence I have chosen is &lt;# #&gt;.

Macros can appear in comments and will work there too.

For now ''Split' and ''Instr'' are used to find the markers, regular expressions might be better but I don't know for sure.  This function is rather complicated in practice but the basic idea is quite straightforward:
*split the text into ''chunks'' using the ''intro'' as a delimiter,
*note the character offset of each ''intro'' string by accumulating the lengths of the ''chunks''
*remove all text that is in comments,
*replace the macros with function calls to a function that stores the value of the named variable along with the start and length of the position where it is to be inserted,

All this happens on a copy of the text, the rich text box is not disturbed at this point.

  Private Function xPreprocess(rsText As String) As String
    
    Const sINTRO As String = &quot;&lt;#&quot;
    Const sOUTRO As String = &quot;#&gt;&quot;
    Dim aChunks As Variant

Split the text using the ''intro'' sequence.  This results in a list (Variant array) of chunks of text that all start with a macro (except for the first item in the list if there was any text before the first macro).

    aChunks = Split((rsText), sINTRO)
    Dim lChunk As Long

The actual text that is executed doesn't need any comments so we create a new text from the chunks by removing the both single line and multiple line comments from the first chunk.  This chunk must be dealt with specially because it is the exception to the rule that all chunks begin with a macro.

    xPreprocess = xRemoveComments((aChunks(LBound(aChunks))))
    Dim lStart As Long

In order for the results to be placed in the text at the correct positions we must keep track of the character offset from the start of the text to the macro.  Note that we must always add the length of the ''intro'' explicitly because it does not appear in the list of chunks.

    lStart = Len(aChunks(LBound(aChunks))) + Len(sINTRO)
    Dim lEnd As Long
    Dim lLenChunk As Long
    Dim lEndVar As Long

Now we can process each chunk and add the processed text to the string to be executed.

    For lChunk = LBound(aChunks) + 1 To UBound(aChunks)

First we must check to see if the macro was terminated searching the chunk for the ''outro''.  If the ''outro'' is missing we raise an error because the user must have made a mistake and forgotten to complete the macro.  It might be argued that we should attempt to patch up the text and continue.  See ''Exercises''.

      lEnd = InStr(aChunks(lChunk), sOUTRO)
      If lEnd Then
        Dim sChunk As String
        sChunk = Left$(aChunks(lChunk), lEnd)

Now we have a complate macro we must check to see if we recognize it.  At the moment there is only one type of macro, that is the ''show value'' macro.
        lEndVar = InStr(sChunk, &quot;=&quot;)
        If lEndVar Then
          xPreprocess = xPreprocess &amp; &quot;;&quot; &amp; vbCrLf _
                      &amp; &quot;show(&quot; &amp; Left$(aChunks(lChunk), lEndVar - 1) _
                      &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; (lStart + lEndVar) &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; (lEnd - lEndVar - 1) _
                      &amp; &quot;)&quot; &amp; vbCrLf _
                      &amp; xRemoveComments(Mid$(aChunks(lChunk), _
                                             lEnd + Len(sOUTRO)))
          lStart = lStart + Len(aChunks(lChunk)) + Len(sINTRO)
        Else

If the ''='' sign is missing then this isn't a ''show value'' macro.  As we haven't defined any others this must be an error so we abort the process and report it.

          Err.Raise UnrecognizedMacro, &quot;xPreprocess&quot;, _
             lStart &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; Len(aChunks(lChunk)) &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; &quot;Unrecognized macro type&quot;
        End If
      Else

If the closing chunk characters are not found we raise an error and abort the process.

        Err.Raise ChunkNotTerminated, &quot;xPreprocess&quot;, _
           lStart &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; Len(aChunks(lChunk)) &amp; &quot;|&quot; &amp; &quot;Unterminated chunk&quot;
      End If
    Next lChunk
    
  End Function
  
It is simpler to convert the macros to code if we remove the surrounding comments.  We can do this on a chunk by chunk basis by defining a function that accepts a chunk and returns the same chunk minus any comments.  

  Private Function xRemoveComments(ByRef rsChunk As String) As String

Deal with the simplest cases first: single line comments and complete multiline comments. 

    xRemoveComments = xRemoveBracketed(rsChunk, &quot;//&quot;, vbLf)
    xRemoveComments = xRemoveBracketed(xRemoveComments, &quot;/*&quot;, &quot;*/&quot;)
  
Now remove any leading or traing multiline comment fragments.  These oocur because the chunk split ignores comment boundaries.  We search the chunk for the closing and opening multiline comment markers.

    Dim lComment As Long
    lComment = InStr(xRemoveComments, &quot;*/&quot;)
    If lComment Then
      xRemoveComments = Mid$(xRemoveComments, lComment + Len(&quot;*/&quot;))
    End If
    
    lComment = InStr(xRemoveComments, &quot;/*&quot;)
    If lComment Then
      xRemoveComments = Left$(xRemoveComments, lComment - 1)
    End If
    
  End Function

This function repeatedly removes substrings that fall between given starting and finishing markers until the starting marker no longer appears in the string.  

  Private Function xRemoveBracketed(ByRef rsChunk As String, _
                                    ByRef rsStart As String, _
                                    ByRef rsfinish As String) As String
    
    xRemoveBracketed = rsChunk
    Dim lStart As Long
    Do
      lStart = InStr(xRemoveBracketed, rsStart) ' single line
      If lStart Then
        Dim lFinish As Long
        lFinish = InStr(lStart, xRemoveBracketed, rsfinish)

If the finish marker does not appear then treat the string as though such a marker appeared at the character following the end of the string.  This allows us to delete single line comments that do not end in a newline sequence and multiline comments that are split by macros.

        If lFinish = 0 Then
          lFinish = Len(xRemoveBracketed) + 1
        End If
        xRemoveBracketed = Left$(xRemoveBracketed, lStart - 1) _
                         &amp; Mid$(xRemoveBracketed, lFinish)
      End If
    Loop Until lStart = 0
    
  End Function


Once the document has been evaluated we must put the answers back in the document at the correct places.  This seems at first to be a simple job because we have a list of values together with their locations in the document so at first sight it seems that we need to do is enumerate the results and replace the specified character ranges with the answers.  Unfortunately this won't work unless the new text is exactly the same length as the original because inserting new text that is of a different length will move the text that is to be replaced so the results records will point at the wrong place.  The solution is to enumerate the results in reverse order so that successive results to are inserted nearer the beginning of the document which means that only text that has already been updated will move.

  Private Sub xUpdateDisplay(roDoc As RichTextBox)
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
    With roDoc

An additional complication is that we would like to preserve the user's selection.  We cannot simply store the values ''.SelStart'' and ''.SelLength'' and later copy them back because replacement may have occurred before or inside the selection, it might even happen that the selection boundaries fall inside a macro.  So each time we do a replacement we must update the selection.  So the first thing we must do is copy the values of those properties.

      Dim lSelStart As Long
      Dim lSelLen As Long
      Dim lSelNext As Long
      lSelStart = .SelStart
      lSelLen = .SelLength
      lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen

We start at the last result record and count back.  The results array is zero based so the results counter always points at the next avaialble slot.  Therefore we decrement the counter at the start of the loop, when we finish the counter will be zero.

      Do While 0 &lt; glResultsCount
        glResultsCount = glResultsCount - 1

To replace the text in the rich text box we must first set the ''.SelStart'' and ''.SelLength'' properties and in order to preserve the user's selection we must compare these values to the current values of the user's selection and update the user's selection if necessary. 

        .SelStart = gaResults(glResultsCount).Start
        .SelLength = gaResults(glResultsCount).length
        If .SelStart + .SelLength &lt; lSelStart Then
          lSelStart = lSelStart - .SelLength
          lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen
        End If

Exactly what the replacement text is depends on the result type and on whether or not an error occurred when trying to calculate it.  If an error occured then we colour the offending text red and leave it unchanged.  

        Select Case gaResults(glResultsCount).ResultType
          Case SourceError
            .SelColor = vbRed
          Case Else

If we succeeded then we colour the selection black and replace replaceable part of the macro with the result.  Now we see the reason for declaring the result as ''Variant'' because at last we see that it is possible to have charts in this document.  How the replacement is actually done depends on the type of the result.  If the result is a [[../Glossary#scalar|scalar]] then it is easy to use Visual Basic's string conversion functions to create a human readable representation but a plot is quite a different animal.  Because they are so fifferent we create separate functions for them.

            .SelColor = vbBlack
            If TypeOf gaResults(glResultsCount).Value Is cPlot Then
              xReplacePlot gaResults(glResultsCount).Value, roDoc
              If .SelStart &lt; lSelStart Then
                lSelStart = lSelStart + 1
                lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen
              End If
            Else
              .SelText = xToString(gaResults(glResultsCount).Value)
              If .SelStart &lt; lSelStart Then
                lSelStart = lSelStart _
                          + Len(xToString(gaResults(glResultsCount).Value))
                lSelNext = lSelStart + lSelLen
              End If
            End If
        End Select
      Loop

Now we can set the ''.SelStart'' and ''.SelLength'' properties again to restore the user's selection.  Of course if it included a macro that was replaced then the length of the selection may be quite different from what it was to start with.

      .SelStart = lSelStart
      .SelLength = lSelLen
    End With
    
    Exit Sub

The error handler in this function is incomplete, an exercise for the student perhaps.  At the moment is simply asserts a falsehood to stop the program and allow the developer to debug it.  In real life this would be quite complicated because we would like to process the whole document.  

  ErrorHandler:
    Debug.Assert False
    Resume
  End Sub

Because this is really a ''proof of concenpt'' rather than a finished aplication we can use a very simply method of converting results to text: just use implicit conversion.  The exception to this is ''matrices''.  Matrices are JScript arrays so we must do some extra work to format them.
  
  Private Function xToString(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    If TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Then
      ' assume that the object is a JavaScript array
      xToString = xJArrayToString(rvResult)
    Else
      Select Case VarType(rvResult)
        Case vbDouble, vbLong, vbInteger
          xToString = &quot; &quot; &amp; rvResult
        Case vbString
          xToString = &quot; '&quot; &amp; rvResult &amp; &quot;'&quot;
        Case Else
          xToString = rvResult
      End Select
    End If
  End Function

If the result is a plot then the result is really the name of a picture file.  To put it in the text we must use the clipboard to insert it, at least that is the simplest way.  If the file doesn't exist then we insert text to say so rather than leave the user wndering where the plot is.  Note that when this routine is called the selection has already been set to the replaceable part of the macro.

  Private Sub xReplacePlot(ByRef rvPlot As Variant, roDoc As RichTextBox)
    
    With roDoc
      If goFSO.FileExists(rvPlot.PicFileName) Then
        .SelText = &quot;&quot;     ' delete the old plot or whatever else there was.
        InsertPicture rvPlot.PicFileName, roDoc
      Else
        .SelText = &quot;File &lt;&quot; &amp; rvPlot.PicFileName &amp; &quot;&gt; does not exist.&quot;
      End If
      
    End With
    
  End Sub

If the result is an array then we format it in rows and columns using tab characters to separate the columns.  It is up to the user to set the tabs for that part of the text.  Unfortunately we haven't given the user the ability to do this yet, another exercise for the student.  
  
  Private Function xJArrayToString(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    Debug.Assert TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot;
    Dim oRow As Variant
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    xJArrayToString = vbTab &amp; &quot;[&quot;
    For lRow = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      If lRow &lt;&gt; 0 Then
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; vbTab
      End If
      Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      If TypeName(oRow) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Then
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; vbTab &amp; xJRowToString(oRow)
      Else
        vItem = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; vbTab &amp; &quot;[&quot; &amp; vbTab &amp; vItem &amp; &quot;]&quot;
      End If
      If lRow &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; vbCrLf
      End If
    Next lRow
    xJArrayToString = xJArrayToString &amp; &quot;]&quot;
    
  End Function

Each row is in fact a JScript array.  JScript doesn't have multidimensional arrays but because everything in JScript is an object we can easily simulate multi-dimensional arrays by having arrays of arrays.

  Private Function xJRowToString(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    Debug.Assert TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot;
    Dim oRow As Variant
    
    Dim lCol As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    xJRowToString = &quot;[&quot;
    For lCol = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      vItem = CallByName(rvResult, lCol, VbGet)
      If VarType(vItem) = vbString Then
        vItem = &quot;'&quot; &amp; vItem &amp; &quot;'&quot;
      End If
      xJRowToString = xJRowToString &amp; vItem
      If lCol &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        xJRowToString = xJRowToString &amp; &quot;,&quot; &amp; vbTab
      End If
    Next lCol
    xJRowToString = xJRowToString &amp; &quot;]&quot;
    
  End Function

==cFunctions.cls==
Predefined functions for EvalDoc.  An instance of this class is provided to the JScript object to provide global functions for such things as matrix multiplication.  Provides an example of multilanguage programming: the application is written in VB, the document in JScript and the library used by JScript is written in VB.

  Option Explicit
    
  Public Enum enumFunctionErrors
    IncompatibleDimensions = vbObjectError + 1
    ChunkNotTerminated
    UnrecognizedMacro
  End Enum
  
The ErrorContextxxxx attributes are used to enable the errorhandlers to determine the location of the offending source code.  Statements are inserted in the code to set these values before the macros.

  Public ErrorContextStart_ As Long
  Public ErrorContextEnd_    As Long
  
Some of the functions need to be able to create variables on the fly so we must provide a reference to the object that is running the script. 
  
  Public oScriptControl  As ScriptControl 
  
Plot is a function that the document can call just as though it were a built in JScript function.  It produces an object that in turn is used to drive the ploticus charting program.  (Many Thanks to Steve Grubb &lt;http://ploticus.sourceforge.net&gt;).
  
The first argument is a matrix holding the data to be plotted and the second must be a string representing the ploticus command line except that it does not include data=datafilename, that is provided aiutomatically becuse we use a temporary file.
  
The matrix is written to a file then the a batch file is created to drive ploticus.  The ploticus file is executed to create a picture file.  The path to this picture file is stored in a cPlot object for later use.
  
Note that Ploticus is very particular about spaces in the command line:

This will fail:  'pl -gif -prefab scat x=1 y =2 data=12 -o 11

because the y =2 should say y=2, note the extra space.

  Public Function Plot(ByRef rvData As Variant, ByRef rsPlotCommands As String) As cPlot
  
    Set Plot = New cPlot
    Plot.PicFileName = TF &amp; &quot;.gif&quot;
    Dim sDataFileName As String
    sDataFileName = xSaveMatrix(rvData)
  
    RunCmd &quot;pl -gif &quot; &amp; rsPlotCommands &amp; &quot; data=&quot; &amp; sDataFileName &amp; &quot; -o &quot; &amp; Plot.PicFileName
    ' @TODO: check output of plot command for errors
  End Function

Ploticus reads its data from a file so we must write one.  We don't care what it is called and we can delete it afterwards so we create a unique file name.  Actually it is possible to create situations where this doesn't work but it is hard.  
  
  Public Function TF() As String
    TF = goFSO.BuildPath(gsTempFolder, Trim$(NextSerial))
  End Function
  

Because ploticus is a separate program we must start it and wait for it to finish.  This routine is a generic command line program executor.

For each parameter that expects an output file name use a macro of the form $(x) where x is the name of a variable that either contains a file name or is to receive an auto-generated file name.  The variable can be used later in other commands.  The user need not consider what the name actually is if it is used in a sequence of commands because the variable will be given a unique string value on first use that points into the temporary session folder.

If you need to provide a file as input and the data is held in a variable then construct the string by concatenating it with calls to the SaveData function; this writes the variable to a new temporary file and returns the file name.

For example you can drive ploticus like this:
  
:s=Cmd('pl -gif -prefab scat x=2 y=3 data=' + SaveData(b) + ' -o $f(plot)')

In this example s receives the output from standard out (if any) and a variable named plot names the file that will receive the ploticus picture.  If the plot variable is an empty string then a unique temporary file name will be created for it.

If you want to re-use a file name make sure that you clear it first unless you really want to use the same name again.
  
Macros are $x(args) where x is the name of the macro and args is whatever arguments the macro takes in whatever form in takes them.

  Public Function Cmd(ByRef rsCommandLine As String) As cPlot
  
    RunCmd rsCommandLine
    '  ' @TODO: check output of plot command for errors
  
  End Function

Ploticus needs the data for the plot in a file with a particular format.  The routine that starts ploticus needs to know the name of that file.  This function creates the file, writes the data to it and returns the file name.

  Private Function xSaveMatrix(rvData As Variant) As String
    xSaveMatrix = goFSO.BuildPath(gsTempFolder, Trim$(NextSerial)) &amp; &quot;.dat&quot;
    goFSO.OpenTextFile(xSaveMatrix, ForWriting, True).Write _
         JArrayToPlotData(rvData)
  
  End Function
  
The macros in the document create result records in the ''gaResults'' array by calling this function.

  Public Sub MakeResult(ByRef rvResult As Variant, _
                        ByRef rlStart As Long, ByRef rlLength As Long, _
                        ByRef reResultType As eResultType)
  
    With gaResults(glResultsCount)

Note that we can't use ''TypeOf'' to find out if the result is a JScript object because the type doesn't exist according to VB.  This is very strange because the ''Locals'' and ''Watch'' windows show it correctly so the ''IDE'' must know.  Use ''typeName'' instead, the disadvantage is that string comparisons are slower.

      If TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Or IsObject(rvResult) Then
        Set .Value = rvResult
      Else
        .Value = rvResult
      End If
      .Start = rlStart
      .length = rlLength
      .ResultType = reResultType
    End With

Another exercise for the student: what happens if ''glresultsCount'' is greater than the upper bound of the array?  What should be done here?

    glResultsCount = glResultsCount + 1
 
  End Sub

The ''Show'' function is public so that JScript can call it.  The macro replacement process puts these calls in the source code replacing the macros.  At the moment this simply calls the ''Makeresult'' routine.  the reason for the wrapper is to facilitate more sophisticated error handling.

  Public Function Show(o As Variant, rlStart As Long, rlLength As Long)
  
    MakeResult o, rlStart, rlLength, Result
  
  End Function

Multiply to JScript matrices together and return another JScript matrix.  This is just a wrapper for the low level matrix multiplication routine.  This wrapper converts the incoming matrices from JScript to VB and the result from VB to JScript.

  Public Function Multiply(ra1 As Variant, ra2 As Variant) As Object
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
  
    Set Multiply = VBMatrixToJArray(xMultiply(JArrayToMatrix(ra1), JArrayToMatrix(ra2)))
  
    Exit Function
  
  ErrorHandler:
    MakeResult Empty, ErrorContextStart_, ErrorContextEnd_, SourceError
  End Function

This function multiplies two matrices.  It is called from the public function ''Multiply''.

The rules for multiplying matrices are given in [[Algebra/Matrix_operations|Matrix Operations]] in the [[Algebra/Matrix_operations|Algebra]] book.  This function is a straightforward implementation using essentialy the same notation as shown on that page.  The one notable difference is that our array indices extend from zero upwards instead of from one upwards.

  Public Function xMultiply(ByRef raA() As Double, ByRef raB() As Double) As Double()
    Dim j As Long
    Dim k As Long
    Dim m As Long
    Dim n As Long
    Dim p As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim aC() As Double
    Dim cij As Double

Remember that the ''Ubound'' function accepts an optional second argument that tells which dimension to return; the first dimension is number one, the second number two and so on.  Matrices have only two dimensions, the first is the row, the second is th column.

    n = UBound(raA, 2)
    m = UBound(raA, 1)
    p = UBound(raB, 2)
  
    ReDim aC(0 To n, 0 To p)
  
    For i = 0 To m
      For j = 0 To p
        nAcc = 0
        For k = 0 To n
          cij = cij + raA(i, k) * raB(k, j)
        Next k
        aC(i, j) = cij
      Next j
    Next i
  
    xMultiply = aC
  
    Exit Function
  
  End Function

==Exercises==
*The strategy of reading the results list from the end instead of the beginning is not guaranteed to work for all documents.  Can you explain why?  Hint, think of the different kinds of JScript statements that you could use.

==modJavaScript==
This module is for functions that help connect the JavaScript document to the Visual Basic world inside the program.

This implementation provides some simple matrix manipulation functions.  Because these are written in Visual Basic and the matrices must be written in JScript we need functions to convert between JScript objects and Visual Basic arrays.

  Option Explicit

JScript matrices are actually nested arrays.  Each row is a one dimensional array of elements and the matrix is also a one dimensional array where each element is an array.  This means that JScript matrices can be [[../Glossary#Ragged Array|ragged arrays]].  In Visual Basic it is usual to represent a matrix as a rectangular array.  In this implementation we shall simply assume that all rows in the array have the same number of elements so we can discover the number of rows by checking the count of the outer JScript array and the number of columns by checking the count of elements in the first row. 

This function converts a JScript array to a Visual Basic array.

  Public Function JArrayToMatrix(rvResult As Variant) As Double()
  
    Dim oRow As Variant
    Dim lRows As Long
    Dim lCols As Long

Finding the number of rows is easy because all JScript objects are in fact dictionaries and they all have a ''length'' property.  Getting the number of rows is slightly more complicated.  We must first get hold of the JScript object that is the first row.  Remember that JScript objects are actually dictionaries so arrays are dictionaries where the keys are numbers.  In the Script control this is mapped so that each item appears to be a property of the object so we can use CallByName to retrieve the value.  The name in this case is simply ''0'' (that's the numeral zero) because JScript arrays are numbered from ''zero'' to ''length - 1''.

    lRows = rvResult.length
    Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, 0, VbGet)    
    lCols = oRow.length

Now we can allocate the Visual Basic array.  To avoid confusion we explicitly specify both the lower and upper bounds; this is good practice because it means that you don't have to wonder whether or not there is an ''Option Base'' statement at the top of the file.

    ReDim JArrayToMatrix(0 To lRows - 1, 0 To lCols - 1)

Now we simply enumerate the rows and copy the contents one row at a time into the array.

    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    For lRow = 0 To lRows - 1
      Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      xJRowToMatrix JArrayToMatrix, lRow, oRow
    Next lRow
    
  End Function

In the interests of readability the copying of data from a row is performed in a separate routine.  Although, in this case, it doesn't add much readability it does serve to clearly distinguish the row operations from the column operations.  Note that this is a subroutine that accepts a ''reference'' to the target array and a ''row number'' because we cannot assign to a row in Visual Basic.

  Private Sub xJRowToMatrix(raMatrix() As Double, _
                            rlRow As Long, _
                            rvResult As Variant)
    
    Dim lCol As Long
    Dim vItem As Variant
    
    For lCol = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      vItem = CallByName(rvResult, lCol, VbGet)
      raMatrix(rlRow, lCol) = vItem
    Next lCol
    
  End Sub

Converting from a Visual Basic array to a JScript matrix can be done by creating a snippet of JScript source code and evaluating it.  All we have to do is create a string that looks just as the user would type it.  Presumably direct manipulation of a JScript object would be faster, if anyone can find out how.

Note the late binding of the function result.  This is because the objects exposed by the Script Control seem to not implement the interfaces that Visual Basic needs.  This could be because of the extra layer of indirection provided by the Script Control.

  Public Function VBMatrixToJArray(raMatrix() As Double) As Object
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim lCol As Long
    Dim sArray As String
    
    sArray = &quot;[&quot;
    For lRow = LBound(raMatrix, 1) To UBound(raMatrix, 1)
      sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;[&quot;
      For lCol = LBound(raMatrix, 2) To UBound(raMatrix, 2)
        sArray = sArray &amp; raMatrix(lRow, lCol)
        If lCol &lt; UBound(raMatrix, 2) Then
          sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;,&quot;
        End If
      Next lCol
      sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;]&quot;
      If lRow &lt; UBound(raMatrix, 1) Then
        sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;,&quot;
      End If
    Next lRow
    sArray = sArray &amp; &quot;]&quot;
    Set VBMatrixToJArray = goEvalDoc.moScriptControl.Eval(sArray)
    
  End Function

==cPlot.cls==
Represents a plot.  Allows the tostring function to decide what to do to display the plot.  The tostring function will use the filename property to find the picture file created by Ploticus and embed that into the rich text file.

  Option Explicit
  Public PicFileName As String
==modPlot.bas==
This module provides the low level connections to ploticus.

  Option Explicit

There are at least two ways to put a picture into a rich text box.  The one chosen here requires the least programming but has the disadvantage that it uses the Windows clipboard which is rather impolite because the user might have something in it at the time.  To do this we use the SendMessage API call which sends windows messages to window handles.

  Private Const WM_PASTE = &amp;H302&amp;
  
  Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;SendMessageA&quot; _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, _
           ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Any) As Long

Insert the picture that was created by ploticus by loading it into the clipboard and then instructing the rich text box to paste it in.

  Public Sub InsertPicture(rsFile As String, rtfText As RichTextBox)
  
    Clipboard.Clear
    Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(rsFile)
    
    SendMessage rtfText.hwnd, WM_PASTE, 0, 0&amp;
  
  End Sub

Ploticus needs a file of data in rows and columns.  This data is represented in our document as a matrix.  We must convert that matrix to a string and then save it to a file.  This function does the string conversion part.  

  Public Function JArrayToPlotData(rvResult As Variant) As String
    
    Debug.Assert TypeName(rvResult) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot;
    Dim oRow As Variant
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    For lRow = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      Set oRow = CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      If TypeName(oRow) = &quot;JScriptTypeInfo&quot; Then
        JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData &amp; xJRowToPlotData(oRow)
      Else
        JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; CallByName(rvResult, lRow, VbGet)
      End If
      If lRow &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData &amp; vbCrLf
      End If
    Next lRow
    JArrayToPlotData = JArrayToPlotData
    
  End Function

  Private Function xJRowToPlotData(rvResult As Variant) As String
  
    Dim oRow As Variant    
    Dim lCol As Long
    For lCol = 0 To rvResult.length - 1
      xJRowToPlotData = xJRowToPlotData &amp; CallByName(rvResult, lCol, VbGet)
      If lCol &lt; rvResult.length - 1 Then
        xJRowToPlotData = xJRowToPlotData &amp; &quot; &quot;
      End If
    Next lCol
    
  End Function

===Exercises===
The ''JArrayToPlotData'' is very similar to the function that converts a JScript matrix to a VB array.  rewrite ''JArrayToPlotData'' so that it uses that function instead of doing that conversion from JScript on its own.  Does this improve the program?  Hint: has the amount of code to be maintained been reduced or has duplication (or near duplication) of code been eliminated?

==modShellWait==
JArithmetic uses external programs to do some of the more complicated work.  These programs are often command line programs so we need some wrapper functions to make the rest of the program think that they are built in functions.

The original of this code was found on http://www.msfn.org/board/lofiversion/index.php/t35615.html.

  Option Explicit
  
  
  Private Const SYNCHRONIZE = &amp;H100000
  Public Const WAIT_OBJECT_0 = &amp;H0
  
  Private Declare Function OpenProcess Lib &quot;Kernel32.dll&quot; _
          (ByVal dwDA As Long, ByVal bIH As Integer, _
           ByVal dwPID As Long) As Long
  
  
  Private Declare Function WaitForSingleObject Lib &quot;kernel32&quot; _
          (ByVal hHandle As Long, _
           ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long) As Long
  
This function is the one used to execute an external program.  It waits no more than ten seconds (10000 milliseconds).  Unfortunately it does not know how to deal with failures.  This is left as an exercise for the student.

  Public Sub RunCmd(CmdPath As String)
   
    On Error GoTo Err_RunCmd
    
    If ShellWait(CmdPath, 10000) Then
      Stop ' error ' @TODO: do something useful here
    End If
    
    Exit Sub
    
  Err_RunCmd:
    Stop ' do something useful here
  End Sub
  
This is the lower level function that executes the command line and waits for a time specified in the call.  See [[../External_Processes|External Processes]].

  Function ShellWait(CommandLine As String, _
                     TimeOut As Long) As Boolean
     
    Dim ProcessID As Long
    Dim hProcess As Long

The Shell command returns a ProcessID which is not actually very useful because almost all Windows API functions use the ''Process Handle'', this isn't a problem though because the ''OpenProcess'' API function can translate between the two.

    ProcessID = Shell(CommandLine)

If the ''Process ID'' is non-zero then the process was created and started so we can just wait for it to complete.  To wait we use an API function called ''WaitForSingleObject'' that takes the ''Process Handle'' and a timeout in milliseconds.  This function simply waits until the process terminates or the timeout expires; it returns a status code to say which.

    If ProcessID Then

Non-zero (True) so Shell worked.  Now get a process handle for the PID (Wait takes a handle).

      hProcess = OpenProcess(SYNCHRONIZE, False, ProcessID)
      If hProcess Then
        Dim lResult As Long
        lResult = WaitForSingleObject(hProcess, TimeOut)
        If lResult = WAIT_OBJECT_0 Then
          ShellWait = True
        Else
          ShellWait = False
        End If
      Else

Failed to get process handle. This can happen if the process terminated very quickly or it might not really have executed at all even though Windows started a process.  Return ''false'' to the caller to say it failed.

        ShellWait = False

==modMain.bas==

The main module is the one that contains all the code that starts the application and gets it into its initial state.  In this case we also use it as a place to declare various constants and global functions.


  Attribute VB_Name = &quot;modMain&quot;
    
  Option Explicit

The constants ''gsFILE_FILTER'' and ''gsSAVE_AS_FILTER'' are used when we show the Common Dialog boxes to open and save files.  The tell the dialog which file masks to put in the combo box.  Notice that we have provided for ''rtf', ''txt'', all files.  This means that the user can open files that are plain text and save them as ''rtf''.  Of course the user can also attempt to open a file that isn't either text or rich text, we must cope with that.  The declarations are public because they are actually used in a different code module.

  Public Const gsFILE_FILTER As String = &quot;Rich text Format(*.rtf)|*.rtf|Text (*.txt)|*.txt|All Files (*.*)|*.*&quot;
  Public Const gsSAVE_AS_FILTER As String = &quot;Rich Text Format(*.rtf)|*.rtf|Text (*.txt)&quot;

The hard work is done by an instance of the ''cEvalDoc'' class'.  We never need more than one instance of this class so we declare it here as a global variable and ''instantiate'' it in the ''main'' subroutine.

  Public goEvalDoc As cEvalDoc

The ''macro'' processor needs to keep track of where in the text replacements are to occur and what the replacement actually is.  The ''tResult'' user defined type (''UDT'') is used to hold the necessary information.  Note that the ''Value'' member is declared as ''Variant'' because the result of an expression can be anything not just a number.

  Public Type tResult
    Value As Variant
    Start As Long
    length As Long
    ResultType As eResultType
  End Type
  
The result type is an ''enumerated'' type.  This makes the code easier to read.  Notice that none of the members has been explicitly assigned a value, this is because we don't care what the values are so long as they are distinct.  

  Public Enum eResultType
    SourceError
    SourceNoError
    Result
  End Enum

We need a place to store the values that we will substitute back in the text because we can't put them in untill we have finished processing the whole document.  The reason for this is that the length of the result might be different from the length of the text it replaces.  We maintain a count of the results so that we can let the ''gaResults'' array expand.  When we evaluate the document again we start off by simply resetting ''glresultsCount'' to zero; this saves time by not requiring the results array to be eallocated every time.

  Public gaResults() As tResult
  Public glResultsCount As Long

The ''FileSystemObject'' is much simpler to use than the older built in VB functions for reading files.  To use it you must have the ''Scripting Runtime Library'' installed.

  Public goFSO As FileSystemObject

Some of the functions used in this program need to create temporary files.  So that we are sure to avoid collisions between different instances of this program and with other programs we create a new temporary folder inside the system temporary folder and store its name in this variable.

  Public gsTempFolder As String

The ''main'' routine initialise the application.  It creates the temporary work area, creates an instance of the document evaluator, shows the main form and allocates the results array.

  Sub Main()
    Set goFSO = New FileSystemObject
    
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
   
    ' Create temporary area for this instance of JArithmetic.
    gsTempFolder = Environ$(&quot;TEMP&quot;) &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; App.EXEName
    If Not goFSO.FolderExists(gsTempFolder) Then
      goFSO.CreateFolder gsTempFolder
    End If
    gsTempFolder = gsTempFolder &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; Format$(Now, &quot;yymmddhhmmss&quot;)
    If Not goFSO.FolderExists(gsTempFolder) Then
      goFSO.CreateFolder gsTempFolder
    End If
        
    Set goEvalDoc = New cEvalDoc
    
    Load fMainform
    
    fMainform.Show
    
    ReDim gaResults(0 To 100)
    
    Exit Sub
  ErrorHandler:
    Debug.Assert False
    MsgBox Err.Number &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; Err.Description &amp; &quot;. Command line = &lt;&quot; &amp; Command$ &amp; &quot;&gt;&quot;, vbOKOnly, &quot;Arithmetic&quot;
      Resume
  End Sub

The application can be closed in several different ways but each one should end with a call to this function so that all the documents are correctly closed.  So far there is no implementation of automatic saving, nor is the user prompted to save changed documents.  This is the place to add such code.

  Public Sub ExitApplication()
    Dim oForm As Form
    For Each oForm In Forms
      Unload oForm
    Next oForm    
  End Sub
  
  
This routine creates a unique number.  It is used by functions that need to create temporary files.  The result is always a whole number but we use ''Double'' instead of ''Long'' so that we 'never' run out of numbers (in this aplication this refinement is hardly necessary).

  Public Function NextSerial() As Double
    Static nSerial As Double
    nSerial = nSerial + 1
    NextSerial = nSerial
  End Function

==prjJarithmetic.vbp==

Here is the Visual Basic project file (''VBP'') used to tie all this together.  In principle it should be possible to automate the downloading and compilation of this.  Do bear in mind that any absolute paths you find in this VBP might not point to anything when copied to your computer.

Sorry to be fussy, but you should say that you are assuming that f and g have continuous first derivatives.

Also the last line &quot;This is equivalent to:&quot; the integral is correct.  But it is not quite the definition of the Riemann integral as it is usually given (as you have c_i and d_i instead of just c_i).  It works because \sqrt{a^2+b2} is continuous function of two variables.  I am not sure if it is worth mentioning it as it is a technicality.

If you want me to I can think if I can find a way around this problem [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 18:14, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">FileSets are ant's way of creating groups of files to do work on.  These files can be found in a directory tree starting in a base directory and are matched by patterns taken from a number of PatternSets and Selectors. 

FileSet identifies the base directory tree with its dir attribute.  Then the FileSet's enclosed pattern elements, both named (PatternSets) and selected by wildcards (Selectors), choose the files and folders within the base tree.

If any selector within the FileSet do not select a given file, that file is not considered part of the FileSet. This makes FileSets equivalent to an &lt;and&gt; selector container.

==Wildcards==
Wildcards are used by ant to specify groups of files that have a pattern to their names.
 
* ? is used to match any character. 
* * is used to match zero or more characters. 
* ** is used to match zero or more directories.

==Examples==
The below FileSets all select the files in directory ${server.src} that are Java source files without &quot;Test&quot; in their name.

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
   &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
   &lt;patternset id=&quot;non.test.sources&quot;&gt;
     &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/patternset&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${client.src}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;patternset refid=&quot;non.test.sources&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot; negate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${server.src}&quot; casesensitive=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;not&gt;
    &lt;filename name=&quot;**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/not&gt;
 &lt;/fileset&gt;

==Finally==
FileSets can appear as children of the project element or inside tasks that support this feature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One important question for transcendalists (historically, anyway) is that of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.  Can we equate natural disaster with evil caused by (a) god?  Insurance claims still refer to natural disasters as acts of god.  Answering this question forces a choice about omnipotence and omnibenevolence.  It would be nice to see some discussion of this in the article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Feedback: Ebay's feedback system is fairly easy to manipulate.  Unscrupulous sellers can wait until they get feedback from a buyer before they leave theirs--If a buyer leaves a negative, the seller can also leave a negative, then ask for mutual feedback removal.  

99% is suitable feedback, anything below 98% should be investigated by checking the feedback comments, and looking for neutrals and mutually-removed feedback.  Check for attitude, and check whoever gave the feedback.  [http://www.toolhaus.org/ Toolhause.org] has a great set of tools to find just the negative and neutral feedback.  Update--As of 2008, Ebay has changed how feedback is calculated, and removed the ability of sellers to leave negative for buyers.  It appears that this is resulting in overall lower feedback scores for buyers.  

Negative signs--These aren't _all_ reasons to avoid a deal, but if there are too many of them be cautious. 

Low number of transactions, but a non-standard, professional looking page layout. 

&quot;Easily repaired&quot;--Although this may be technically true, almost all repairs will involve servicing--Disassemble, clean, reassemble, lube and adjust, plus any replacement parts.  $40 is cheap for a proper servicing.  &quot;Easily repaired&quot; from a professional watch seller--if it is easy, why not get the repair done and sell it for more?

&quot;Overwound&quot;--Apparently this is intended to mean that someone wound the watch too much and the repair is simple.  There's no such thing as overwound--instead there is something that has kept the watch from unwinding.  This could be simple dirt, requiring a basic servicing, or damaged parts that have to be hand-made at great expense.  

&quot;Just needs a battery (no returns)&quot;. Likely true if it is an inexpensive quartz, otherwise be careful.  Especially true for Accutrons.  &quot;Works with test battery&quot; or &quot;will include new battery for $&quot; is probably OK.  'quits when face up/face down'--Probably a broken balance pivot or jewel.  

Blurry or tiny pictures:  Potluck.  Watches are difficult to accurately photograph.  If it is an occasional seller, or someone who specializes in a different type of item, it may be OK.  If they sell lots of watches, possibly hiding something.  I've had some very good luck buying items with bad pictures from people who don't sell watches regularly. 

Pay attention to shipping charges, and avoid sellers with excessive charges.   If no shipping is listed, always ask costs before bidding.  

Positive signs:

Picture of the movement, especially for vintage mechanicals.  Not so important for Timex or quartz.

Many clear pictures

Pointing out flaws

Returns accepted

High feedback, both percentage and number of transactions. 

Clear statement about running condition--&quot;Runs and keeps time&quot;, &quot;Keeps time to within XX per day&quot; &quot;Doesn't run, balance good&quot; &quot;Runs and stops&quot; (Assuming you can deal with whatever problems they say)


Watch lots:

It is fairly frequent that a batch of watches will sell for about the price of the best watch in the batch.  I will typically add up the minimum I think the watches will re-sell for individually, and bid accordingly.

Features requested on this page are very unlikely to be implemented if they aren't on the [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=21302&amp;atid=371302| SourceForge list]. If you are interested in any of the features listed below, '''''you''''' must take the responsibility of making sure they're requested on [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=21302&amp;atid=371302| SourceForge].


= Keyboard Commands =
== Customized Command Key Assignments ==
It might be useful if it were possible to specify customized command key assignments in a configuration file.
== Scripted Key Commands ==
It might be useful if it were possible to create user-defined key commands using Lua scripting.

:This already is possible. See the example script [[Celestia/Celx Scripting:Q&amp;A:Assigning Custom Key Functions with CELX|elsewhere]] in this WikiBook. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:43, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

= Time Controls =
== Change Time Flow Rate While Paused ==
It might be useful if it were possible to change the time flow rate while paused, so that when the pause is ended time would flow at the new rate.

:This is possible in Celestia v1.4.1 ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:44, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== GOTO Spacecraft In Time ==
Currently, one needs to look at the SSC file to see when a spacecraft begins (such as Mir). Doctorjoe created a simple patch, which I have applied to my OS X builds without a problem, that shows the start and end times of a spacecraft in the view window. In addition, hitting shift-G, takes you to the spacecraft's temporal and physical location.

I have this patch now... and would be happy to send it to anyone who wants to try incorporating it into CVS (contact: BlindedByTheLight).

Furthermore, it might be cool to allow more than just two dates (start and end) to appear in the view. Various spacecrafts have SEVERAL temporal points of interest. Perhaps changing the code so that people could declare various times with text labels...


Start Time: 34747373.4234234

Start Text: &quot;Ship takes off&quot;


Date1: 35343434.2343

Date1Text: &quot;Ship passes the moon&quot;


Date2: 35324344.2343223

Date2Text: &quot;Ship circles Jupiter&quot;


End Time: 342423434

End Text: &quot;Ship crashes into Io&quot;


Then a keyboard shortcut to go to each successive point in time...? Would be cool and would open up a whole new world for add-ons designers.

= Render Options =
== Improved illumination phase functions ==
It might be nice to allow planet/satellite illumination functions to vary dependent on the surface type. Presently objects like Jupiter are more realistic with the default lambert function. Solid surfaces are less realistic and might be improved with a type of &quot;lunar lambert&quot; function.
== Improved distance filters ==
It might be nice to allow distance filters for any object, not only stars. When you have a populated system, it's annoying see all/none names/orbits. It could be possible show only largest/important/brightest names/orbits of objects from your FOV.
== Display coordinates ==
It might be useful to show galactic and equatorial coordinates.
== Display apparent magnitude for planetary bodies ==
It would be interesting to have the apparent magnitude of the selected planetary body displayed. The program already performs these calculations, for instance, to set the scale of the planetary scaled discs, so I assume it wouldn't be too difficult to add this information to the planetary information display.

== Display axis ==
It might be useful to show rotation axis of bodies which I selected to see their orbits.
== Display speed/forces ==
It might be useful to show ship's speed/forces (angular and radial) when I do a follow/sync orbit/track selection.
== Create visual filters ==
It might be wonderful to apply filters: select between infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma spectrum, simple polarized colors, aberration of light, high level of ambiental light. A stereographic mode, for use with red-cyan glasses, could be excellent (StarStrider have this).
== Improved real-time clouds ==
It might be nice to update clouds from public databases.

= View Controls =
== Zoom to Fill ==
It might be useful if there were a key command to cause the view to zoom so that the selected object fills the screen. Then the user could select an object of small apparent size (by onscreen picking or keying-in its name), press a key to center it in the view, and press another key to zoom the view so the object fills the screen. This would be more convenient than manual zooming.
== Select Orbits ==
It might be useful if you can select which orbits (from one group) you will see (if orbits turned on) - for example only from objects with a special size.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially if you have many asteroids in you Solar System Browser it becomes very complex in the presentation. An alternativ or additionally it might be useful to group orbits close to each other in a &quot;fuzzy&quot; orbit - similary to the rings of a planet.
== Third-Person View ==
It might be useful if you can see from perspective an Official Celestial Ship for navigation.

= Solar System Browser =
== Presentation ==
It might be useful if you can categorise and / or group planets and asteroids, so that a list doesn't become too complex.
== Proximity lists ==
It would be interesting to have a list of the closest objects to the current position not only in the star browser, but also in the planetary one. It would be even more interesting if the program included a function that returned the closest approaches to a given body (or between two bodies of choice) in a given interval.

= Orbits =
== Galactic Orbits (stellar proper motion) ==
It might be useful if galactic orbits could be simulated based on stellar proper motion where available.
== Segmented Orbits ==
It might be useful if orbits could be defined with multiple segments, combining elliptical orbit segments with different elements, xyz files, etc.
Also if orbits for objects could be made up of different ephemeris data blocks. i.e. so the orbit is correct for various dates of interest. This would be useful when considering planet/moon events and spacecraft missions etc. At the moment using beginning and ending nearly works but celestia then has multiple objects with the same name and does not switch to the visible object of the same name at the specified ending of the objects life. Hence the satellite/Moon/asteroid disappears and the new object pops up but is not traked only the &quot;ghost&quot; object.
== Horseshoe and Tadpole Orbits ==
It might be useful if horseshoe and tadpole orbits could be specified.
== SPICE Orbits ==
It might be useful if orbits could be specified using NASA's SPICE files.

:SPICE orbits will be supported in Celestia v1.5.0. They already can be used in its prereleases. See the documentation [[Celestia/Trajectories|elsewhere]] in this WikiBook. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:49, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Horizons Orbit Data Extraction Tool ==
It might be useful if there were a tool for extracting orbit data from JPL's Horizons system into a Celestia-compatible format.
== Critical Interval Orbit Overrides ==
It might be useful if there were a way to specify xyz data for higher-precision during critical time intervals (e.g. spacecraft flybys) while using less precise orbital data at other times.
== Multiple Star Orbit Display ==
It might be useful if orbits could be displayed for binary/multiple stars.

:This already is possible in Celestia v1.4.1. See the documentation [[Celestia/STC File|elsewhere]] in this WikiBook. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:51, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Detect collisions ==
It might be useful if I could select 2 bodies and calculate past and future collisions as Eclipse Finder. Or merge both as an &quot;Events Finder&quot; with alerts.
== Extended eclipse finder ==
It would be real neat to have an extended eclipse finder, able to find them for any body, not just the predefined ones.

= Browser =
== Show Stars and Planets around Barycenters ==
It might be useful if it would be possible in the Star Browser to select the barycenter of a binary and then see the corresponding stars with subsequent planets or planets around the barycenter.

== Improved search ==
It might be useful if you can search a name and see all objects which matches it (in any part of the word). And could be interesting show all known names from an object (for example, 2003 UB313 / Xena)

= Label Display =
== Star Labels ==
=== Star Label Density Control ===
It might be useful if it were possible for the user to control the density of star labels, e.g. with a magnitude limit.
=== Catalog Preference for Star Labels ===
It might be useful if it were possible for the user to specify a precedence ordering of catalogs for selecting which star labels to use.
= Data Loading =
== Reload Data Without Restart ==
It might be useful if it were possible to reload the data without restarting the program. This would make it more convenient to test incremental changes to data. Such a reload should be able to reload one file, one directory or all of the data.

= Scripting =
== CEL Scripting ==
== CELX Scripting ==
=== Disable User Inputs During Script ===
It might be useful if there were a script command to disable user inputs while the script is running. Another script command could reenable inputs if desired. The inputs wouild be reenabled automatically when the script ends, and of course the &quot;escape&quot; key to abort the script would always be enabled.

=== Write Messages to Log from Script ===
It might be useful if were possible to write messages to the log from a script.

=== Display Error Messages in Log ===
It might be useful if scripting error messages were displayed in the log.

= Views =
== Save Multiple Views in Celestia URLs ==
It might be useful if multiple views could be saved in a Celestia URL. This would make it possible to easily restore a desired view layout.

== Separate Rendering Flag Settings for Each View ==
It might be useful if Celestia allowed separate rendering flag settings for separate views. This would make it possible, for example, to show orbits in one view but not another.
== Default Bookmarks ==
It might be useful to create default views such as solar system view from above.

= Data Files =
== Merge STC and SSC file formats ==
At present Celestia requires separate file formats for stars (STC) and other bodies (SSC). It would work better if these were combined into a single file format with features of both.

== Planetary Barycenters ==
The modelling of planets with large moons is unrealistic because the barycenter of the planet-moon system is always the center of the planet. If a barycenter for a planet-moon system could be specified, the motion of the planet and moon can be modelled more accurately. Examples of systems that can be modelled correctly with this new feature would be Pluto-Charon, Earth-Moon, and certain binary asteroids.

:''I believe you can currently create barycenters for planets/moon/asteroids, just not in .ssc files. They have to go in .stc files. Granted, this is an inconvenience.''

::The Class &quot;invisible&quot; hack was defined long ago for just this purpose. Celestia v1.5.0 adds the ReferencePoint directive for use in SSC files. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:56, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Local InfoUrls ==
Local InfoUrls: have Celestia check local directories for InfoUrl files (html/cel/celx) before trying to look it up on the www. Alternatively, allow local InfoURL files to be specified explicitly.

:This latter capability already exists. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:58, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

== Spectral Light Emission ==
Implement a method to change the spectral color of stars in the STC. If for example you want to create a green star you can now add a green star texture with the &quot;texture&quot; command, but the halo of the star still has the color of the originally selected type i.e. &quot;G2V&quot;. So the star doesn't look right.
Perhaps a command with [R G B] values for this could be added.
:See: &quot;Why aren't there any green stars?&quot; [http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q72.html] Briefly, stars are black body radiators, so the spectral emission of a star is determined by its temperature. Stars emit light at essentially all wavelengths across the spectrum. We perceive color based on the wavelengths to which the receptor cells in our eyes are sensitive. Black body spectra don't have the proper proportion of radiation at different wavelengths to cause our eyes to perceive the light as green.

== Multiple Names in the SSC ==
It might be useful if the objects in the SSC allowed multiple names like stars. This would make it possible, for example, to select asteroids by not only its name but also the number. And this allows enabling translation of the objects' name into various languages keeping original English name.
== Customized body categories ==
(I'm not sure where this one fits best. Feel free to move around)
It would be useful to be able to set up customized object categories, for instance, to separate main body asteroids from TNOs or dwarf planets, or whatever the user sees fit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Isn't the Many to Many recursive diagram incorrect? Surely one set of crows feet should be on the package and another on the activity. - Peter Johnson - peter.johnson@screechlaboratories.co.uk

*Use a similar example throughout the chapter for the 1:1, 1:M, and M:M sections. Perhaps one that relates to business.

*Bold key words and start with clear definition after each.

*Follow author guidelines to revise chapter.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;b&gt;XML: Managing Data Exchange/Recursive relationships - Editorial Board revisions - Viji&lt;/b&gt;

* remove the XSL items from the Learning Objectives

'''Introduction'''

&quot;... such as a one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many&quot; - those are the only relationships that we have studied so far, therefore using &quot;such as&quot; does not really make sense.



* Where (and if) appropriate change the headings that read &quot;one to one model&quot; to &quot;one to one recursive model&quot; etc.

'''a look at new elements''' - change to '''New schema elements''' 

* bold the element tags just to highlight them and set them apart

* also follow the tag with its definition then set a break before the rest of the explanation / examples
 
* what does &quot;On {32}... &quot; mean? Does it mean line 32?  Since there are no line numbers and we are not using line numbers because they really don't match up, find another way of referencing the code line (if infact that is what is going on here).  you can even copy and paste the code refered to here
--- that same sentence should probably read &quot;only one&quot; instead of &quot;one only&quot;
 
* &quot;Experiment with changing the predecessor value on of the XML file above to “1”, and you will see that the file will not validate!&quot; - include where in the XML document, which variable must be changed to &quot;1&quot;.
 
* xpath is introduced for the first time here, please give a brief definition or description - it does not have to be exacting, it can be general - also do this before the &lt;xsd:unique&gt; element, mentioning that it will come later in the paragraph

''' change examples to fit with the tourguide model '''

(one to one recursive: perhaps use changes in the names of cities (like Istanbul was Constantinopal) but you would need at least three names; or from the previous 1:1 chapter example you could say that the top destination changes every year and make a recursive relationship from that)

(one to many recursive: perhaps use a state and cities and a city that is the state capital - ignore the bit about some countries somewhere with two capitals - you can make it smaller, perhaps 2 states with 4 cities one of which is the capital)

(many to many recursive: perhaps use a tourist package with air flights, hotel nights, museum trips, sightseeing, etc. which can be bought separately or in various packages)

* once again I think line numbers are being used ({41} and {18 - 21}), refer to the code in another way - you can even copy and paste the code refered to here

Remember to move the exercises to another link and link to answers - refer to the single entity chapter for the format.

Thank you!

==Professor's comments==
The examples in this chapter need to be redone using ID and IDREF to make them simpler. Some of the prior comments (e.g., defining Xpath) will not be appropriate as a result.
The tour examples are a good idea to keep with the tourism theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Reverse Engineering Chapter}}

This section will talk about reverse-engineering proprietary file formats. Many software developers need to reverse engineer a proprietary file format, especially for the purposes of interoperability. For example, every year the Open Office project needs to reverse engineer the Microsoft Office file formats. Furthermore, reverse engineering is required for forensics purposes. The chapters in this section will talk about how to understand a proprietary file format.

{{TODO|This entire section is in need of some help and contributions. If you know anything about this field of study, please help and contribute. This chapter might eventually even include a discussion on reverse-engineering file systems.}}

== Typical Features ==

=== File Header ===
Most file formats begin with a &quot;header,&quot; a few bytes that describe the file type and version.
Because there are several incompatible file formats with the same extension (for example, &quot;.doc&quot; and &quot;.cod&quot;), the header gives a program enough additional information to see if this file is one of the formats that program can handle.

Many programmers package their data in some sort of &quot;container format&quot; before writing it out to disk.
If they use the standard zlib to hold their data in compressed form, the file will begin with the 2 bytes 0x1f 0x8b (in decimal, 31 139 ).

=== Blank Space ===
Some files are made up largely of blank space, for example, .ds_store files generated by OS X. Blank space will appear as a series of 0's in a hex editor. The creators of a file format may add blank space for a variety of reasons, for example, the author of [https://wiki.mozilla.org/DS_Store_File_Format this study] on .ds_store files speculated that they exist to speed up writing data, as other data would not need to be pushed around to make room. They could also serve to prevent fragmentation.

For most purposes, blank space can be ignored.

== Tools ==

File format reverse engineering is the hour of [[Reverse_Engineering/Hex Editors|hex editors]]. Typically they are used more often to display file contents as opposed to editing them. Hex editors allow you to superimpose a data structure on top of the data (sometimes called ''custom views'' or similar), which are very helpful. Once a particular structure has been discovered in a file, these mechanisms can be used to document the structure, as well as to provide a more meaningful display of the information than just hex code.

Also useful are Unix/Linux tools like '''strings'''(1) and '''file'''(1).

;strings:Finds and prints sequences of printable characters in a file. This can give hints of what data is embedded in the file.
;file:Attempts to determine a file type. Sometimes file format designers re-use already well known file formats or file compression algorithms. There is a small but notable chance that '''file'''(1) can reveal this.

Windows ports of these tools are also available. E.g. as part of the [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] environment (''strings'' is part of the ''binutils'', don't ask ...).

Equally important as a hex editor is a brain. File format reverse engineering means to reason about what the hex editor and other tools displays. To guess structures, relations and the meaning of the data, to develop theories and then verify them. Very few tools can help here.

In a few limited cases additional tools are helpful. E.g. for checking brute-force if a particular part of the file consists of some embedded, compressed data. Typically such tools are written or scripted on the fly as custom tools. Another typical set of custom tools are  the ones which are used to break up a file into separate components - once it has been discovered that a particular file indeed consists of separate parts, and how they are separated in the file. C/C++, Java, but also scripting languages like [[wikipedia:Perl|Perl]] are often used here (Perl because it can handle binary data, while classic Unix scripting tools are often limited to text data only).

In some cases a proprietary file format might contain executable code. For example, a firmware update file for some embedded device very likely contains executable code. Typically that code is wrapped into some structure, e.g. a file system, compressed, garnished with boot/flash code etc. In such cases a disassembler/decompiler for the particular executable format might be helpful.

Further, documentation of and familiarity with checksum algorithms, compression algorithms, encoding techniques, and also programming languages is very helpful.

Also very helpful is the availability of the application that produces and reads the proprietary file format. That application can be used to create test files, but also [[#Probing|to verify if an own generated file is correct]].

== Strategies ==

Look for the obvious first. E.g. magic numbers, a block structure, ASCII text in the file. Anything that can be more or less identified clearly can be the entry ticket to more. Once a particular structure has been identified, look for in-file pointers to that data. E.g. if the data is referenced from some other part of the file with an absolute or relative address.
It is also very important to find out the byte order (little endian or big endian).

===Choosing the target===
If you have access to the software that created the file, you can always create files with the contents of your choosing. This makes reverse engineering substantially easier. In cryptography terms, you are engaging in a [[w:chosen-plaintext attack]].

=== Probing ===
Once you formulate theory as to what some data in the file might mean, you can verify that theory by creating a manipulated file. Replace it with some other data using a hex editor or a custom tool. Then load the manipulated file into the original application. If the application loads the file and displays the intended change, the theory is probably correct. Sometimes it is not trivial to change the application and reload it because of the defense mechanism that may be present. Some application check the hash and signature of the code before running it.

== Compression, Encryption &amp; Scrambling ==

=== Introduction ===
File formats which are either in part or completely compressed, encrypted or scrambled are among the toughest nuts to crack. Of course, compression is different from encryption, and typically done for a different purpose. However, the resulting file formats often look similar: A bunch of gibberish. This is the intended result when file format designers go for encryption, but it is also often a desired side effect when compression is applied.

{{Warning|Please note: [[Wikibooks:Legal_disclaimer|Wikibooks does not give legal opinions]]}}

If checking a file with a hex editor or similar reveals that it just contains gibberish and e.g. not any easy to identify text strings, patterns or similar, it might indicate that the particular file is compressed, encrypted or scrambled. The methods for reverse engineering these files are similar. There might, however, be a big difference from a legal point of view. Many countries have laws against circumventing copy protection, and encryption can be seen as some kind of copy protection. See [[Reverse Engineering/Legal Aspects]] for some more hints regarding this, and seek qualified legal advice before attempting to reverse engineer an encrypted or otherwise protected file format. Similar issues might arise when a file format just uses scrambling. The format &quot;owner&quot; might argue that the scrambling is used as some kind of copy protection, encryption or whatever, and circumventing it might break some law. Again, seek qualified legal advice.

The remainder of this section only deals with reverse-engineering the compression of a file. This is typically just an initial step in the complete reverse-engineering process. Once it has been successfully decompressed, other reverse engineering methods need to be applied to identify the file contents and structure.

=== Well-Known Compression Algorithms ===

Often file format designers apply well known compression algorithms. Either in the form of even using a particular, well known implementation of a certain algorithm (a well-known tool), or by re-implementing a well known algorithm unchanged. In the easiest case this has been documented. For example, it is well documented that the OpenOffice file format uses ZIP archives, and therefore there is no point in reverse engineering that format.

Unfortunately, for many formats we don't have this documentation. In case a well-known implementation of a particular algorithm has been used it is often relatively easy to reverse engineer. Such compressed file formats tend to start with a format identifier (''magic number''), clearly identifying the particular compressed format. The compression tool has left its &quot;fingerprint&quot; in place.

The file is compressed with &lt;tt&gt;ARJ&lt;/tt&gt;. Not only does the string ''DTA.ARJ'' give it away for the human eye, but also the first two bytes &lt;tt&gt;60 ea&lt;/tt&gt;, which are known to identify ARJ-compressed files.

The Unix/linux tool '''file'''(1) is quite aware of many standard compressed file formats.
{{Example|'''file''' returns the following for the above mentioned firmware file
 firmware.bin: ARJ archive data, v6, slash-switched, original name: DTA.ARJ, os: MS-DOS
}}

The next steps after the compression format has been discovered is obvious: To obtain a version of the used compression tool and to use it to decompress the data. The result, however, often needs more reverse engineering. For example, the above mentioned router firmware might contain separate sections for separate areas of the router's flash memory, each guarded with an own checksum.

A variant of using a well known compression algorithm and tool can also sometimes be found, which is more difficult to reverse engineer. In such a case the file is prefixed with some additional data, and the actual compression format can't be identified by just checking the file format. Lets assume, for example, another fictitious SOHO router's firmware update file, which is build as it follows:
{{Example|Fictitious structure of another SOHO router firmware update file:
 +--------------------------+
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Boot loader             &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 +--------------------------+
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Decompression algorithm &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 +--------------------------+
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Compressed data         &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 +--------------------------+
}}

Of course, the format can only be known once the file format has been reverse engineered. So how is that done? Well, in the fictitious case we assume that an inspection with the Unix/Linux tool '''strings'''(1) reveals the following interesting strings in the file:

{{Example|Abridged output of '''strings''':
 :
 :

 invalid window size

}}

The strings are very revealing, and those knowledgeable will recognize the name ''Mark Adler'' as one of the authors of &lt;tt&gt;zlib&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.zlib.net/ &lt;tt&gt;zlib&lt;/tt&gt;], which is the base for &lt;tt&gt;info-zip&lt;/tt&gt; as well as GNU's [http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ &lt;tt&gt;gzip&lt;/tt&gt;]. Those not so knowledgeable might at least have the idea to search for the name and the keyword compression.

It is a good bet to assume that at least parts of the file are ZIP compressed. Further probing might reveal that the file does not contain a complete ZIP archive, but just a section which is compressed with the ZIP &lt;tt&gt;deflate&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm, and supposed to be decompressed with the ZIP &lt;tt&gt;inflate&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm (likely version 1.1.3, as the output of '''strings''' revealed). Therefore, the fictitious file might be further separated into its components by using a custom tool which iteratively applies the &lt;tt&gt;inflate&lt;/tt&gt; algorithm to the file, until the generated result makes some sense (e.g. until the result contains some recognizable clear text strings).

=== Unknown or homemade Compression Algorithms ===

If the software that either creates or reads the file is available then it is very possible to reverse the file format.  You can use live analysis of the running application when reading/writing the file.  Doing this is likely the easiest way to determine the data structure of the file.

If the software is not available, all bets are off if there is an unknown or homemade/ad-hoc compression algorithm, or a non-standard implementation of a known algorithm. One has to be exceptionally lucky to figure out the details of the applied algorithm, so the accompanying decompression algorithm can be constructed, although cryptologists strongly discourage the use of ad-hoc encryption schemes, as they typically do not stand up to serious cryptanalysis.

Sometimes additional information can be found. E.g. if a vendor has filed a patent application for a particular algorithm, or is known to have fallen in love with a particular compression technology in other products, e.g. communication protocols. Sometimes it might turn out that the file format actually belongs to some OEM or 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party product, and that information about that product is available.

Otherwise, there is a small chance that trial-and-error might reveal something about the file. e.g. run-length encodings are a popular, simple and easy to implement compression algorithm, so they can sometimes be found in homemade implementations. It might be worth a try to investigate if a file might be compressed that way. An investigation of a few other well known compression techniques might also be worth a try.

Last but not least, crypto-analysis techniques might reveal something interesting about the compression. E.g. reoccurring blocks of information might point to a particular compression algorithm. However, this requires a lot of effort, time and skill.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Folkstyle Wrestling is the form of Wrestling that is practiced mostly in American high schools and colleges.  It is also known as collegiate wrestling.  The object of folkstyle wrestling is to pin your opponent.  Failing this, you want to get as many points as possible. 

Folkstyle scoring focuses mainly on changes in control. Taking an opponent down to the mat, escaping from or reversing control, or turning an opponent's back to the mat are all scoring situations. This differs from other styles such as Freestyle or Greco Roman, which don't encourage escapes or reversals.

The scoring for folkstyle wrestling is as follows:  turn an opponents back to the mat for 3 seconds, score 2 points.  Hold him for 5 seconds, and you earn 3 points .  In a takedown, once you gain control of your opponents hips and they have 3 points of balance (arms and legs) on the mat, you earn 2 points.  If they can reverse the position so that they have control of your hips, they earn 2 points.  If they simply get away so that you both are standing with no one in control, it is called an escape and they earn one point.

      <comment>/* The Four Positions */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Objective==
There are three basic victory conditions in a wrestling match:
*Pinning your opponent (Win By Fall)
*Scoring more points than your opponent in the time alotted (Win By Decision)
*Scoring 15 points more than your opponent at any point during the match (Win By Technical Fall)
**In team tournaments and meets, different points are awarded to the team, depending on whether or not a pin occurred, how large the point spread was at the end of the match one.

==The Format==
*Three periods
**Can be different amount of time for periods depending on the league
***For College the Norm is usually 3-2-2
***For High School the Norm is usually 2-2-2
***For Modified and Youth the Norm is usually 1-1-1

==The Five Positions==
*Neutral
*Referee's Position
**Top
***Optional/Freestyle
**Bottom

==Ways to Score==
There are 5 ways to score-

*Takedown- Defined as taking opponent from feet to mat.  This is worth 2 points.

*Escape- Defined as escaping opponent's control and facing him.  This is worth one point.

*Reversal- Defined as coming from mat, and taking opponent to mat, in a single move/move combo, which is worth 2 points.

*Nearfall- Points gained when opponent's back/shoulders break the 45 degree plane with respect to the mat for a duration of time.  A two-four count awards you 2 points, then a 5 count awards you 3 points.
*Riding Time-Defined as being in control on the mat, for a long period of time, usually used in collegiate wrestling.  If one wrestler has more than 1 minute more of riding time than his opponent, he is awarded 1 point at the end of regulation time.

==Penalties==

*Stalling
**Fleeing the mat


*locking hands around waist on ground without 2points of body

Note:(When a wrestler lifts another off the mat, it is the lifting wrestler's responsibility to ensure the other's safe return to the mat.)

*Locking hands strictly around an opponent's waist while on the mat.

*Potentially Dangerous
**Choking
**Full Nelson
**Body Figure Four
**Head Scissors
**Chicken wing (extended past a certain point)
**Arm across the back above 90 Degrees

*Unsportsmanlike conduct
**Swearing
**Striking
**Unnecessary Roughness
**Grabbing of the singlet
**Throwing your headgear
**physically hurting your opponent for revenge of previous match
**Smack Talking

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bode Plots ==
Bode plots plot the transfer function. Since the transfer function is a complex number, both the magnitude and phase are plotted (in polar coordinates). The independent variable &amp;omega; is swept through a range of values that center on the major defining feature such as time constant or resonant frequency. A magnitude plot has dB of the transfer function magnitude on the vertical axis. The phase plot typically has degrees on the vertical axis.

[[File:Example45B.png|thumb|voltage across capacitor and resistor parallel combination is the output]]
[[File:Example45bode1.png|thumb|Bode plot for V&lt;sub&gt;CR&lt;/sub&gt; compared to V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; which looks like a passive, low pass filter with slope of -40dB/decade, the cut off frequency looks to be 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 radian/sec. The resistor dominates at DC and the capacitor dominates at very high frequencies. ]]
[[File:Example14Transfer.png|thumb|find current through R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
== MatLab tr and bode ==
===Example 1===
[[Circuit_Theory/TF_Objectives#Applications|Previously]] the transfer function was found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{\mathbb{V}_{cr}(s)}{\mathbb{V}_s(s)} = \frac{1}{CLs^2 + \frac{Ls}{R} + 1} = \frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 1} &lt;/math&gt;
MatLab has a short hand notation method for entering this information where the coefficients are listed (high power to low power)(numerator first, then denominator). For this example
&lt;pre&gt;
f = tf([1],[1 2 1])
&lt;/pre&gt;
Leaving the colon off the end should display the transfer function.
The next step is to plot it:
&lt;pre&gt;
grid on
bode(f)
&lt;/pre&gt;
The result is a low pass filter. Rather than understand how to create these plots (not trivial), the goal is to interpret the plot .. (which is almost the same thing). But at this point, the goal is to exercise MatLab. 
[[File:Example14Bode.png|thumb|Bode diagram of R3 current versus V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, looks like a notch filter at around 1K radians/sec]]
===Example 2===
[[Circuit_Theory/TF_Examples|Previously]] the transfer function was found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{I}_o}{\mathbb{V}_s} = \frac{1000s^3 + 5*10^9s}{s^4 + 5*10^6*s^3 + 2.000015*10^{12}*s^2 + 3.5*10^{13}*s + 5*10^{13}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
f = tf([1000 0 5*10^9 0],[1 5*10^6 2.000015*10^12 3.5*10^13 5*10^13])
grid on
bode(f)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Magnitude Graph ===
Bode magnitude plots are dB which is both a measure of power and voltage and current simultaneously. The vertical dB axis is not an approximation or relative to anything. The vertical axis is an accurate number. The horizontal, dependent axis could be radians/sec or Hz.

=== Phase Graph ===

The Bode Phase Plot is a graph where the radial frequency is plotted along the X axis, and phase shift of the circuit ''at that frequency'' is plotted on the Y-axis. Axis could be in radians or degrees, frequency could be in radians per second or Hz.

== Poles and Zeros ==
A transfer function has 7 features that can be realized in circuits. Before looking at these features, the terms pole, zero and origin need to be defined. Start with this definition of a transfer fuction:
:&lt;math&gt;H(j\omega) = \frac{Z(j\omega)}{P(j\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;
*Zeros are roots in the numerator.
*Poles are roots in the denominator.
*The origin is where s = j&amp;omega; = 0 (no real part in a Bode analysis). When the frequency is zero, the input is DC. This is where after a long time caps open and inductors short. 

The 7 possible features in a transfer function are:
*A constant 
*Zeros at the origin (s in the numerator)
*Poles at the origin (s in the denominator)
*Real Zero (an s+a factor in the numerator)
*Real Pole (an S+a factor in the denominator)
*Complex conjugate poles
*Complex conjugate zeros

The bode and bodeplot functions are available in the [http://www.mathworks.com/products/control/ MatLab Control system toolbox]. [http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Bode/BodeFiles.html BodePlotGui] does the same thing and is discussed here. BodePlotGui was developed at Swarthmore through an NSF grant. There is a summary of the [http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Bode/Bode.html Swathmore Bode Diagram tutorial].

Circuit simulation software can plot bode diagrams [https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/s5c7k7/p9-5/ also].

== Bode Equation Format ==

let us say that we have a generic transfer function with poles and zeros:

:&lt;math&gt;H(j\omega) = \frac{(\omega_A + j\omega)(\omega_B + j\omega)}{(\omega_C+ j\omega)(\omega_D + j\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

Each term, on top and bottom of the equation, is of the form &lt;math&gt;(\omega_N + j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can rearrange our numbers to look like the following: 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_N(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_N})&lt;/math&gt;

Now, if we do this for every term in the equation, we get the following:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{bode}(j\omega) = \frac{\omega_A \omega_B}{\omega_C \omega_D}
      \frac{(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_A})(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_B})}
           {(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_C})(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_D})}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the format that we are calling &quot;Bode Equations&quot;, although they are simply another way of writing an ordinary frequency response equation.

== DC Gain ==

The constant term out front:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_A \omega_B}{\omega_C \omega_D}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the &quot;DC Gain&quot; of the function. If we set &lt;math&gt;\omega \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that everything in the equation cancels out, and the value of H is simply our DC gain. DC then is simply the input with a frequency of zero.

== Break Frequencies ==

in each term:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + \frac{j\omega}{\omega_N})&lt;/math&gt;

the quantity &lt;math&gt;\omega_N&lt;/math&gt; is called the &quot;Break Frequency&quot;. When the radial frequency of the circuit equals a break frequency, that term becomes (1 + 1) = 2. When the radial frequency is much higher than the break frequency, the term becomes much greater than 1. When the radial Frequency is much smaller than the break frequency, the value of that term becomes approximately 1.

=== Approximations ===
Bode diagrams are constructed by drawing straight lines (on log paper) that approximations of what are really curves. Here is a more precise definition. 

The term &quot;much&quot; is a synonym for &quot;At least 10 times&quot;. &quot;Much Greater&quot; becomes &quot;At least 10 times greater&quot; and &quot;Much less&quot; becomes &quot;At least 10 times less&quot;. We also use the symbol &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; to mean &quot;is much less than&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; to mean &quot;Is much greater than&quot;. Here are some examples:

*1 &lt;&lt; 10
*10 &lt;&lt; 1000
*2 &lt;&lt; 20 Right!
*2 &lt;&lt; 10 WRONG!

For a number of reasons, Electrical Engineers find it appropriate to approximate and round some values very heavily. For instance, manufacturing technology will never create electrical circuits that perfectly conform to mathematical calculations. When we combine this with the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; operators, we can come to some important conclusions that help us to simplify our work:

If A &lt;&lt; B:
*A + B = B
*A - B = -B
*A / B = 0

All other mathematical operations need to be performed, but these 3 forms can be approximated away. This point will come important for later work on bode plots.

Using our knowledge of the Bode Equation form, the DC gain value, Decibels, and the &quot;much greater, much less&quot; inequalities, we can come up with a fast way to approximate a bode magnitude plot. Also, it is important to remember that these gain values are not constants, but rely instead on changing frequency values. Therefore, the gains that we find are all ''slopes'' of the bode plot. Our slope values all have units of &quot;decibel per decade&quot;, or &quot;db/decade&quot;, for short.

== At Zero Radial Frequency == 

At zero radial frequency, the value of the bode plot is simply the DC gain value ''in decibels''. Remember, bode plots have a log-10 magnitude Y-axis, so we need to convert our gain to decibels:

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(DC Gain)&lt;/math&gt;

== At a Break Point == 

We can notice that each given term changes it's effect as the radial frequency goes from below the break point, to above the break point.  Let's show an example:

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + \frac{j\omega}{5})&lt;/math&gt;

Our breakpoint occurs at 5 radians per second. When our radial frequency is ''much less'' than the break point, we have the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = (1 + 0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(1) = 0db/decade&lt;/math&gt;

When our radial frequency is equal to our break point we have the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = |(1 + j)| = \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(\sqrt{2}) = 3db/decade&lt;/math&gt;

And when our radial frequency is much higher (10 times) our break point we get:

:&lt;math&gt;Gain = |(1 + 10 j)| \approx 10&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Magnitude = 20\log_{10}(10) = 20db/decade&lt;/math&gt;

However, we need to remember that some of our terms are &quot;Poles&quot; and some of them are &quot;Zeros&quot;.

=== Zeros ===

Zeros have a positive effect on the magnitude plot. The contributions of a zero are all positive:

;Radial Frequency &lt;&lt; Break Point : 0db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency = Break Point : 3db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency &gt;&gt; Break Point : 20db/decade gain.

=== Poles ===

Poles have a negative effect on the magnitude plot. The contributions of the poles are as follows:

;Radial Frequency &lt;&lt; Break Point : 0db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency = Break Point : -3db/decade gain.
;Radial Frequency &gt;&gt; Break Point : -20db/decade gain.

== Conclusions ==

To draw a bode plot effectively, follow these simple steps:

#Put the frequency response equation into bode equation form.
#identify the DC gain value, and mark this as a horizontal line coming in from the far left (where the radial frequency conceptually is zero).
#At every &quot;zero&quot; break point, increase the slope of the line upwards by 20db/decade.
#At every &quot;pole&quot; break point, decrease the slope of the line downwards by 20db/decade.
#at every breakpoint, note that the &quot;actual value&quot; is 3db off from the value graphed.

And then you are done!

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Purpose:
Having a good stance is one of the most important skills to have in wrestling.  As you will learn, a good stance is vital to your success.  Throughout the book, we will be referring back to your stance and movement, so make sure that you master it now. A good stance will allow you to both defend against an opponents attack and initiate your own offensive moves. The finer points of the stance will be decided by your wrestling style (which you should already be formulating, based on the information in the last chapter) but the basic stance remains the same.  Your knee's should be bent (to varying degrees based on style), your head should be up (more on this in the next chapter), and your weight should be distributed evenly throughout your foot (more on this in the next chapter as well).  You may think that your stance is supposed to be comfortable... It's not.  In order for you to get the maximum amount of both offense and defense, you are going to have to stand in an uncomfortable position.  Figuring out your ultimate wrestling strategy will be discussed near the end of the book, but for now it is best to master all the different stances, so as to keep your options open.  The different choices that you have during your stance include:


# '''Staggered Stance''' Or '''Square Stance'''
# '''Straight Back''' or '''Curled Back'''
# '''Forward Lean''' or '''Regular Lean'''
# '''High Stance''' or '''Low Stance'''
# '''Fingers Forward''' or '''Palms Forward'''


Let's go through all of these options in detail:

# '''Staggered''' or '''Square''' Stance
*Movement
**Don't Cross Feet
**Lead Leg Movement in Staggered Stance

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some of the Ant best practices that have been identified for creating maintainable Ant build files.  Best Practices are not enforced by any compiler but they are conventions that allow people that are maintaining many projects to become quickly familiar with your build process.

==Learn Ant Best Practices==
Building your Ant Vocabulary
* Study ant build scripts for other Open Source projects
* Learn domain-specific targets such as building jar files, doing XML transforms or complex installs
* Depending on diversity of tasks this might take a few hours to a few weeks

      <text xml:space="preserve">* [[/Mere Christianity/]] by C.S. Lewis
: '''C'''(live) '''S'''(taples) '''Lewis''' (1898-1963) &amp;#8722; British author, literary scholar, and Christian apologist. He wrote more than 40 books, the best-known being, [[../Famous works of fiction/The Screwtape Letters|The Screwtape Letters]] (1942). This satire is a masterpiece of diabolical wit and moral wisdom involving a correspondence between two devils, Screwtape, one of the upper echelon in Satan's &quot;Lowerachy,&quot; and his nephew, &quot;Dear Wormwood,&quot; a junior devil with an earthly mission, wherein the human &quot;patient&quot; is under close scrutiny. The Allegory of Love (1936), his major critical work, is a study of love in medieval literature. [[/Mere Christianity/]], an expanded series of 1943 BBC radio chats, is most admired and influential across a wide spectrum of Christians, which may attest to the author's success in accomplishing the aim of restating theology in a way that avoids many controversies. He also wrote a well-known science-fiction trilogy and the [[/Chronicles of Narnia/]] fantasies for children.

== Growing Conditions ==
Reducing the ground until completely free from root-weeds helps in potato husbandry; though in many seasons one cannot complete these operations without losing the proper time for planting, which never ought to come after the first of May, if circumstances do not absolutely prevent it.

Cutting the seed into small slips does not provide any advantage, for the strength of the stem at the outset depends in direct proportion upon the vigor and power of the seed-plant. Accordingly, make the seed plant large, rarely smaller than the fourth-part of the potato; and in the case of small seed-potatoes one may profitably use half of the potato. At all events, rather err in using over-large seed than in making it too small; because, by the first error, no great loss can ever be sustained; whereas, by the other, a feeble and late crop may result. With properly cut seed, it requires from ten to twelve hundredweight of potatoes to plant an acre (1.2 to 1.5 t/ha) of ground, where the rows lie twenty-seven inches (700 mm) apart; but this quantity depends greatly upon the size of the potatoes used; large potatoes may require a greater weight, but the extra quantity will abundantly pay off in the superiority of the crop which large seed usually produces.

Cultivation should go twelve inches deep, if the soil will allow it; after this, the gardener should open a hole (about six inches (150 mm) deep and not more than twelve inches (300 mm) in diameter).

 There are two common alternate methods of growing potatoes by the amateur gardener. The first is container growing. One seed potato should be placed 15cm (6in) deep in a container which is 30cm (1ft) or more in diameter. Normal potting compost can be used. The amount of potatoes will obviously be small, but it's fun for the small garden.

The second method is to cover the planting area for early varieties  with black polythene, simply held down with earth or bricks.  The potatoes are planted at normal depth by cutting a '+' shaped hole in the plastic and planting with a trowel. The advantages are that the soil is warmed by the black polythene, giving the young plants protection from frost. The potatoes should be ready for harvest a couple of weeks earlier than normal.

==Varieties==


==Uses==


==Maintenance==


==Propagation==why potato is not a root

==Harvest==
Potatoes are ready for harvest when the foliage first starts to die and turn yellow. Early (new) potatoes can be lifted earlier (no earlier than June) to get the very tastiest potatoes. In this case, harvest them about a week after the potato plant flowers first appear. New potatoes only produce a couple of handfuls of potatoes per plant, so dig up the whole plant.

Maincrop potatoes will be ready for harvest in mid-Autumn (start of September at the earliest). For all potatoes, dig them up from the side of the ridge (a fork or spade are both fine) to avoid damaging the potatoes. The foliage can be placed on the compost heap only if it completely free from disease - if not, burn it. If you don't need all the potatoes from a plant at one time or if you want a few early in the season, simply burrow around the roots with your hands and remove the potatoes you need. The remaining potatoes will continue to grow.

Remove any soil clinging to the potatoes and leave them on the soil for a few hours to dry out - if they are stored damp, they will rot. Leaving them on the soil surface in the sun will harden the skin slightly, doubling the storage time - this is especially important for maincrop potatoes. Store the potatoes in boxes or sacks, checking them every few days, removing all but those in good condition. Damaged or blemished potatoes should be eaten immediately.

One word of caution, some potato flowers may well turn to berries which are definitely poisonous. Eaten in sufficient amounts the berries can be fatal. You may wish to remove them if children are likely to see them.

Store up potatoes for winter and spring use; and as one should keep them as long through summer as possible, make every endeavor to preserve them from frost, and from sprouting in the spring months. For frost protection, cover them well with straw when lodged in a house, and by a thick coat of earth when deposited in a pit; to prevent sprouting, pick them carefully at different times, when they begin to sprout, and dry them sufficiently by exposure to the sun, or by a gentle toast of a kiln.

==Pests and Diseases ==
Potatoes grown from stock certified as free from disease and planted in soil not occupied by potatoes the previous season, are relatively free from pests and diseases. The most common ailments to affect potatoes are potato blight (see next paragraph), scab, slugs, and wireworm. There is little protection available that can effectively solve these problems.

Potato blight has two phases - the first attacks the leaves, the second attacks the potatoes themselves. If your potatoes are attacked by the blight, there is no cure. However, cut the foliage back to 5cm (2in) from the ground at the first signs of infection. This will prevent the blight from getting to the potatoes themselves. With no foliage, the potatoes will not give of their best, but they will continue to grow for a month or so.

= Addition =

Addition is based on counting.  For example, Pat and Chris each have a few rocks in their collections.  Pat counts her rocks and finds that she has 3 rocks.  Chris counts his collection and he has 5 rocks.  When they combine their collections and count them all, the total they get is 8 rocks.  3 rocks plus 5 rocks equals 8 rocks.

The total is also call the sum.  When counting the total, it obviously does not matter whether Pat counts hers first or Chris counts his first.  5 + 3 = 8 as well as 3 + 5 = 8.  This concept works for any addition situation.

*'''When adding, it does not matter which number is first.'''

== One-digit numbers ==

Knowing the basic addition facts for all the one-digit numbers is crucial for doing arithmetic efficiently.  Adding  any number to zero always gives the original number.  No matter how many rocks Pat has, if Chris has none, together they have a sum thatis the same as Pat's amount.

The addition of digits other than zero must be memorized.  Use the table below to review these facts.  Find one number to be added, in the left column; find the other in the top row.  The sum is where the column and row meet.

{|align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

|}

== Multi-digit numbers ==

Pat went on a day trip.  In the morning she traveled for 3 hours.  In the afternoon she traveled 8 miles.  How long was her trip altogether?

This question cannot be answered (unless there is more information available, such as an average travel speed.)

* '''Only the same kind of things can be added.'''

This concept is used in adding multi-digit numbers.  (It is also used in adding fractions, and letters in algebra.)

When adding multi-digit numbers, the digits must be aligned so that the digits in the same place values are one under another.

Example:  14 + 36

{|
|
 {| 
 | 
 | align=&quot;right&quot; | 14 
 |- 
 | + 
 | align=&quot;right&quot; | 36
 |-
 | colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black;&quot; | =
 |}
|
 {|
 | The ones digits are aligned. &lt;br&gt; And the tens digits are aligned. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 |}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Operations==

This chapter gives some theoretical basics about structure of Lisp
programs. 

===Syntax===

Lisp operates on forms. Each Lisp form is either an atom or a list of
forms. Atoms are numbers, strings, symbols and some other structures.
Lisp symbols are actually quite interesting - I'll talk about them in
another section.

When Lisp is forced to evaluate the form it looks whether it's an atom
or a list. If it's an atom then its value is returned (numbers,
strings and other data return themselves, symbols return their value).
If the form is a list, Lisp looks at the first element of the list, which is called
its '''car''' (an archaic term which stands for '''C'''ontents of the '''A'''ddress part of '''R'''egister). The car of a list should be a symbol or
a lambda-expression (lambda-expressions would be discussed later). If
it's a symbol Lisp takes its function (the function associated to
that symbol - NOT its value) and executes that function with the
arguments taken from the rest of the list (if it contains forms
they're evaluated as well).

Example:
(+ 1 2 3) returns 6. Symbol &quot;+&quot; is associated with the function '''+''' that
performs the addition of its arguments.
(+ 1 (+ 2 3) 4) returns 10. The second argument contains a form and is
evaluated before being passed to the outer '''+'''.

===Some interesting functions===

'''+''', '''-''', '''*''', '''/''' are basic operations on numbers. They can accept
multiple arguments. Note that (/ 1 2) is 1/2, not 0.5 - Lisp knows
rational numbers (as well as complex ones...). '''&lt;''', '''&lt;=''', '''=''' and so on
are used for number comparison. Note that '''=''', '''&lt;''', '''&lt;=''' and others are '''''[[wikt:en:polyadic#English|polyadic]]''''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (= 1 1 1) ⇒ t
 (= 1 1 2) ⇒ nil
 (&lt; 1 2 3) ⇒ t
 (&lt; 1 3 2) ⇒ nil
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''list''' as the name suggests creates a list.
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (list 1 2 3) ⇒ (1 2 3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''cons''' creates a pair (a pair has 2 elements and is '''not''' a list).

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (cons 1 2) ⇒ (1 . 2) ;;note the dot. 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''car''' or '''first''' returns the first element of the cons (pair). '''cdr'''
or '''rest''' returns the second element of the cons.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (car (cons 1 2)) ⇒ 1  (cdr (cons 1 2)) ⇒ 2
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

or 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (first '(1 2)) ⇒ 1  
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (second '(1 2)) ⇒ 2  
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Lists and conses===

Since lists are so prominent in Lisp it's good to know what they exactly are. The truth is that, with one exception, lists consist of conses. This exception is a special list called '''nil''' - also known as '''()'''. '''nil''' is a ''self-evaluating'' symbol that is used both as a falsehood constant and an empty list. '''nil''' is the only false value in Lisp - everything else is true for the purpose of '''if''' and similar constructs. The opposite of '''nil''' is '''t''', which is also self-evaluating and represents the truth. '''t''' is, however, not a list. Let's return to the lists, then... A ''proper list'' (improper lists will not be explained here) is defined as any list that is either '''nil''' or a '''cons''' whose '''cdr''' is a proper list. (Note that since proper lists have to start from somewhere, &lt;code&gt;(cdr (cdr (cdr... (cdr x)))...)&lt;/code&gt; is '''nil''' for some finite number of '''cdr'''s.)

Basically, a proper list is a sequence of conses, such that the next cons is a cdr of a previous cons. It's easy to understand how lists are constructed if you consider a graphical representation. A cons can be represented as a rectangle divided into two squares. Each of squares can hold a value. In a proper list left square holds the element of the list, and the right square holds the next cons (or '''nil''' if it is the end of the list). Note that each cons holds exactly one element of the list. That's how (1 2 3) would look in graphical representation:

 .-------.
 | * | * |
 '-|---|-'
   V   V
   1 .-------.
     | * | * |
     '-|---|-'
       V   V
       2 .-------.
         | * | * |
         '-|---|-'
           V   V
           3  nil

So (1 2 3) is really (1 . (2 . (3 . nil))). What follows from that is that (car (list 1 2 3)) is 1 and (cdr (list 1 2 3)) is (2 3). What doesn't follow from all of the above is that (car nil) and (cdr nil) are '''nil'''. This is not very consistent, because (cons nil nil) is not the same thing as nil, but it happens to be convenient.

===Symbols===

Symbols play the same role as variable names in other programming
languages. Basically a symbol is a string associated with some values.
The string can consist of any characters, including spaces and control
characters. However, most symbol names do not use characters other than letters, numbers, and hyphens,
because they're awkward to type. In addition, the characters &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, whitespace, and the double and single quote marks are likely to be misunderstood by the lisp reader; and other characters such as &quot;*&quot; are conventionally used only for certain purposes.  By default Lisp converts what you type to uppercase.

Symbols are created as you use them. For example, when you type (setf x
1) symbol called &quot;X&quot; is created (remember that Lisp uppercases your
input) and its value is set to 1. However it is good style to define
your symbols before you use them. '''defvar''' and '''defparameter''' are used
for that purpose.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter x 1) ;;defines symbol &quot;X&quot; and sets its value to 1.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A symbol can also have other parameters associated with it besides its name and value - functions, classes
and so on. To get a function associated with a symbol, a special
operator (these are discussed in the next chapter) '''function''' is used.

===Macros and special operators===

There are operators in Lisp that look like functions, but behave
slightly differently. These are macros and special operators. Functions always evaluate their arguments, but occasionally this is undesirable, so these forms must be implemented.

For example, consider the ubiquitous '''if''' construct. '''If''' takes the form (if ''condition'' ''then'' ''else''); ''condition'' is first evaluated, followed by ''then'' if ''condition'' is not '''nil''' or ''else'' if it is '''nil'''.  Thus, (if t 1 2) returns 1 and (if nil 1 2) returns 2.  Obviously, '''if''' cannot be implemented as a function because only one of its two final arguments will be evaluated. Thus, it is created as one of about 25 special operators, which are all predefined in the Lisp implementation.

Another special operator is '''quote'''. It returns its only argument,
''unevaluated''. Again, this is impossible with functions, as they always
evaluate their arguments. Quote is used quite often, so it can be expressed by the single character ' . Thus, (quote x) is equivalent to 'x. '''quote''' may be used to
quickly create lists: '(1 2 3) returns (1 2 3), '(x y z) returns
(x y z) - compare that to (list x y z) which would create a list of
''values'' of x, y and z, or signal an error if no values were assigned.
In fact, '(x y z) is the same value as (list 'x 'y 'z).

Macros are like special operators, but they're not hardcoded in a Lisp
implementation. Instead, they can be defined in Lisp code. A lot of Lisp constructs
you will be using are actually macros. Only very essential constructs are
hardcoded. Of course, to the user there is no difference.

==Simple programming==

In this chapter I'll explain how to do simple things in Lisp. Many useful constructs will be introduced. After reading this chapter, you should be able to write simple programs.

===Storing values===

While storing values in variables is an important process in many
programming languages, in Lisp it is used much less often. Although it is multi-paradigm, Lisp is often referred to and programmed in as a functional language.  Functional languages do not allow (or at least discourage) the use of state, or stored information that implicitly changes the behavior of a function.  In theory, assignments are never needed in a purely functional program. As you may
have noticed, I never stored values anywhere in the previous chapter,
except in the &quot;Symbols&quot; section. This shows that the storing of global values is rarely needed.

That being said, it is still useful to store values, and Lisp ''does'' provide for this. The macros '''setf''' and '''setq''' store values into symbols:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setq x 1) =&gt; 1
 x =&gt; 1
 (setq x 1 y 2 z 3) =&gt; 3
 (list x y z) =&gt; (1 2 3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Setf''' is much more powerful than '''setq''', as it allows the programmer to change a single part of a variable:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setq abc '(1 2 3)) =&gt; (1 2 3)
 (setq (car abc) 3) =&gt; error!
 (setf (car abc) 3) =&gt; 3
 abc =&gt; (3 2 3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
For this reason, '''setf''' is used more often than '''setq'''.

In other languages, assignments are usually denoted as something like '''x=1'''. The '''=''' here means something different than the mathematical '''=''' sign.  Lisp reserves '''=''' for the mathematical definition, i.e. testing for numerical equality.  It may appear that &lt;tt&gt;(setf place value)&lt;/tt&gt; is more complicated than needed, but it is useful to remember that this facility is extensible and allows the user to remove the internal representation of data from the assignment.  This is similar to reassigning the '''=''' operator in other languages (something not possible in C and some other languages).

'''Setf''' is a useful utility, despite the extra keystrokes it requires.  In practice, though, you'll be using assignment less often than in other languages, because there is another way in Lisp to remember values: by binding them.

''Note: '''setq''' stands for '''set q'''uote. Originally, a '''set''' function existed that would evaluate its first argument. Programmers got tired of quoting the argument, and defined this special operator. '''Set''' is now deprecated.''

===Binding values===

When values are ''bound'' to symbols, they are temporarily stored and then unbound, the values forgotten. With '''let''' and '''let*''' you can bind some values to some variables
within some part of your program. The difference between '''let''' and '''let*''' is
that '''let''' initialises its variables in parallel and '''let*''' does it
sequentially. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (let ((x 1) (y 2) (z 3)) (+ x y z)) =&gt; 6
 (let* ((x 1) (y (+ x 1)) (z (+ y 1))) (+ x y z)) =&gt; 6
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Inside the body of '''let''' you can use variables you defined as though
they're real symbols - outside of '''let''' these symbols can be unbound or
have completely different values. If you call or define functions
within the '''let''' body, the bindings stick around, making some interesting
interactions possible (these are outside of the scope of this
manual). You can even use '''setf''' on these variables and the new value
would be stored temporarily. As soon as the last form in '''let''' body is
executed its result is returned, and the variables are restored back
to their original values. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf x 3 y 4 z 5) =&gt; 5
 (let ((x 1) (y 2) (z 3)) (+ x y z)) =&gt; 6
 (+ x y z) =&gt; 12
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Good programming practices generally recommend using local variables whenever possible, and limiting global variables only to when it is absolutely necessary.  Thus, you should use '''let''' whenever possible, and treat '''setf''' like there is a tax on each use.

===Control flow===

The '''if''' operator was already explained before, but may seem hard to use at this point. This is because '''if''' allows only one form for each branch, which makes it hard to use in most situations.
Fortunately, Lisp syntax
gives you more freedom to define your blocks than C's curly braces or Pascal's '''begin'''/'''end'''. '''progn''' creates a very simple block of code, executing its arguments one by one and returning
the result of the last one. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (progn (setf x 1 y 2) (setf z (+ x y)) (* y z)) =&gt; 6
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''let''' and '''let*''' can also be used for this
purpose, especially if you want some temporary variables inside the
branches. 

'''block''' creates a named block, from which you can return
with '''return-from''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (block aaa
   (return-from aaa 1) 
   (+ 1 2 3)) =&gt; 1 ;;The form (+ 1 2 3) is not evaluated.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

...and other forms exist, such as '''the''', '''locally''', '''prog1''', '''tagbody''' and so on.
Fortunately, if you're not into writing Lisp macros, '''if''' is probably
the only construct where you'll have to use blocks.

As '''if''' is quite ugly when used repeatedly, there are some convenient macros in place so you
won't have to use it all that often. '''when''' evaluates its first argument
and, if it's not '''nil''', evaluates the rest of its arguments, returning
the last result. '''unless''' does the same if its first argument is
'''nil'''. Otherwise they both return '''nil'''.

'''cond''' is slightly more complicated, but also more useful. It tests its conditions until one
of them is not nil and then evaluates the associated code. This is easier to parse and better-looking than nested '''if''''s. The syntax of '''cond''' is as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (cond (condition1 some-forms1)
       (condition2 some-forms2)
       ...and so on...)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''case''' is similar to '''cond''' except it branches after examining the value
of some expression:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (case expression
   (values1 some-forms1) ;values is either one value 
   (values2 some-forms2) ;or a list of values.
   ...
   (t some-forms-t)) ;executed if no values match
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
				
'''or''' evaluates its arguments until one of them is not nil, returning
its value, or the value of last argument.

'''and''' evaluates its arguments until one of them is nil, returning its
value (nil, that is) - otherwise the value of the last argument is
returned.

You may notice that '''or''' and '''and''' could be used as logical operations
as well - remember that everything non-nil is true.

===Loops===

Iteration, or evaluating a form many times, is covered by many tools
evaluating something many times. The most useful tool is '''loop''' - in
its simplest form it simply executes its body until the '''return'''
operator is called, in which case it returns the specified value:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setf x 0)
 (loop (setf x (+ x 1)) (when (&gt; x 10) (return x))) =&gt; 11
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

More complicated forms of '''loop''' are better learned through examples. Depending on the type of iteration wanted, different operators, such as '''for''' and '''until''', are used.  While '''loop'''
should be enough for all kind of loops, there are other constructs for
those who wouldn't like to learn its full syntax.

'''dotimes''' executes some code a fixed number of times. Its syntax is:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (dotimes (var number result) 
   forms)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''dotimes''' increments ''var'' from 0 to ''number'' and executes ''forms'' each time with that value of ''var'', returning ''result'' in the end.

'''dolist''' iterates through a list: its syntax is the same as of '''dotimes''' except that a list replaces ''number''.  ''var'' begins as the list's '''car''' and is moved until it reaches the list's last element.

'''mapcar''' applies a function to different sets of arguments and returns
a list of results, for example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (mapcar #'+ '(1 3 6) '(2 4 7) '(3 5 8)) =&gt; (6 12 21)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;'+ is a shortcut for (function +). The function + is first applied to
the list of arguments (1 2 3), then to (3 4 5) and then to (6 7 8).

===Defining functions===

Functions are defined using macro '''defun''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun function-name (arguments)
   (body))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The created function is associated with the symbol ''function-name'' and
can be called like any other function. It's worth mentioning that
functions defined that way can be recursive or can call each other - this is an essential part of most Lisp programming. An example of a recursive function is:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (defun factorial (x)
   (if (= x 0) 1
     (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As can be seen, this function simply describes an otherwise complicated operation by calling itself over and over. The process is stopped when x = 0, and x decreases with each call, eliminating (for positive integer x) the possibility of an infinite loop.  Note that x, being an argument, takes on a different value for each call of the function.  As seen in &quot;Binding values&quot; above, none of these values override any of the previous.

The special operator '''lambda''' creates an anonymous function, which you can
use for a one-time purpose. Its syntax is the same except instead of
&quot;defun function-name&quot; you write &quot;lambda&quot;. These functions cannot be
recursive. For the most part, lambda functions are used in forms such as '''mapcar''' (and '''funcall''' and '''apply''' below) to eliminate excessive repetition or memory use.

You can also bind functions temporarily with '''flet''' and '''labels'''. They
are very similar to '''let''' and '''let*'''. The difference between them is
that in '''labels''' a function can refer to itself, while in '''flet''' it
refers to a former function with the same name instead.

===Calling functions===

To call a function f with arguments a1, a2, and a3, simply type

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (f a1 a2 a3)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Sometimes the function which should be called is stored in a variable
and you don't know its name beforehand. Or maybe you don't know how
many arguments are to be passed. In those cases the functions '''funcall''' and
'''apply''' become handy. Like all functions they evaluate their arguments
- the first one should produce a function to be called, the rest
should produce arguments. '''Funcall''' just calls the function with
whatever arguments supplied. '''Apply''' checks if its last argument is
a list and if it is, it treats it as a list of arguments. Compare:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (funcall #'list '(1 2) '(3 4))  =&gt; ((1 2) (3 4))
 (apply #'list '(1 2) '(3 4)) =&gt; ((1 2) 3 4)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===User interaction===

For this tutorial I've cover only the simple tasks of input and output. To read a value from the user use the '''read''' function. It will attempt to read an arbitrary Lisp expression from the input, and the value returned by read is that expression.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 &gt;(read)  ;Run read function
 (+ 1 x)  ;That's what the user types
 (+ 1 X)  ;that's what is returned
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In that example the returned value is a list of three elements: symbol +, number 1 and symbol X (note how it got uppercased). '''read''' is one of the three functions that comprise ''read-eval-print'' loop, the core element of Lisp. This is the same function that is used to read the expressions you type at the Lisp prompt. 

While '''read''' is handy for receiving numbers and lists from the user, other data-types are expected by most users to be fed to computer in a different manner. Take strings for example. To make '''read''' recognise a string one must add double quotes around it &lt;code&gt;&quot;like this&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. But a normal user expects to just type &lt;code&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt; without the quotes and press Enter. So, there is a different general-purpose function used for input: '''read-line'''. '''read-line''' returns a string that contains what user typed before pressing Enter. You can then process that string to extract the information you need.

For output there is also quite a number of functions available. One that is interesting to us is '''princ''', which simply prints a supplied value, and also returns it. This may be confusing when using it in the Lisp console:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 &gt;(princ &quot;aaa&quot;)
 aaa
 &quot;aaa&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first aaa (without the quotes) is what is printed, while the second one is a returned value (which is printed by the '''print''' function and it is not as nice-looking). Another function that could be useful is '''terpri''', which prints a new line to the output (the name &quot;terpri&quot; is historical and means &quot;TERminate PRInt line&quot;).

== Phasor Arithmetic ==

This page will review phasors and phasor arithmetic topics.

== Forms == 

Phasors have two components, the magnitude (M) and the phase angle (&amp;phi;). Phasors are related to sinusoids through our cosine convention:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = |M| \angle \phi = |M| \cos (t\omega + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Remember, there are '''3 forms to phasors''':
==== Phasor Form ====
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = |M| \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt;

==== Rectangular Form ====
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = A + jB&lt;/math&gt;
==== Exponential Form ====
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = |M|e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt; 

Phasor and Exponential forms are identical and are also referred to as polar form.

== Converting between Forms ==

When working with phasors it is often necessary to convert between rectangular and polar form. To convert from rectangular form to polar form:

:&lt;math&gt;|M| = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan \left( \frac{B}{A} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

To convert from polar to rectangular form:

A is the part of the phasor along the real axis

:&lt;math&gt;A = |M|\cos \left( \phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

B is the part of the phasor along the imaginary axis

:&lt;math&gt;B = |M|\sin \left( \phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

== Addition ==

To add two phasors together, we must convert them into rectangular form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = A_1 + jB_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = A_2 + jB_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 + \mathbb{C}_2 = (A_1 + A_2) + j(B_1 + B_2)&lt;/math&gt;

This is a well-known property of complex arithmetic.

== Subtraction ==

Subtraction is similar to addition, except now we subtract

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = A_1 + jB_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = A_2 + jB_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 - \mathbb{C}_2 = (A_1 - A_2) + j(B_1 - B_2)&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplication ==

To multiply two phasors, we should first convert them to polar form to make things simpler. The product in polar form is simply the product of their magnitudes, and the phase is the sum of their phases.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = M_1 \angle \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = M_2 \angle \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 \times \mathbb{C}_2 = M_1 \times M_2 \angle {\phi_1+\phi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Keep in mind that in polar form, phasors are exponential quantities with a magnitude (M), and an argument (&amp;phi;). Multiplying two exponentials together forces us to multiply the magnitudes, and add the exponents.

== Division ==

Division is similar to multiplication, except now we divide the magnitudes, and subtract the phases

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_1 = |M_1| \angle \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_2 = |M_2| \angle \phi_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb{C}_1 \over \mathbb{C}_2} = {|M_1| \over |M_2|} \angle {\phi_1-\phi_2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Inversion ==

An important relationship that is worth understanding is the '''inversion property''' of phasors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M_C\angle 0 = -M_C \angle \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in degrees,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M_C\angle 0^\circ = -M_C \angle 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

On the normal cartesian plane, for instance, the negative X axis is 180 degrees around from the positive X axis. By using that fact on an imaginary axis, we can see that the Negative Real axis is facing in the exact opposite direction from the Positive Real axis, and therefore is 180 degrees apart.

== Complex Conjugation ==

Similar to the inversion property is the '''complex conjugation property''' of phasors. Complex conjugation is denoted with an asterisk above the phasor to be conjugated. Since phasors can be graphed on the Real-Imaginary plane, a 90 degree phasor is a purely imaginary number, and a -90 degree phasor is its complex conjugate:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^* = M \angle -90^\circ = M \angle 270^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Essentially, this holds true for phasors with all angles: the sign of the angle is reversed to produce the complex conjugate of the phasor in polar notation. In general, for polar notation, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^* = M \angle -\phi&lt;/math&gt;

In rectangular form, we can express complex conjugation as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = A + jB&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^* = A - jB&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the only difference in the complex conjugate of C is the sign change of the imaginary part.</text>

== Introduction ==

=== Purpose of this book ===

This book has the purpose to illustrate:

* What the basics of the game are.
* How a beginner can learn the basics of the game.
* How a coach can teach the basics of the game to a team of beginners.

=== Intended audience ===
the intended audience for this is for people of all ages

=== Spirit of the game ===

== Fundamentals ==

&quot;What?!&quot;, I hear you cry, &quot;people actually call this a sport?&quot; Well, yes.
Now, the rules basic rules of Ultimate Frisbee, as we like to call it, are remarkable simple. It is only when you delve a little deeper that things start to get complicated. But all things in good time, and here is the general gist of the game for a total ultimate virgin;

There are two teams on the pitch at any one time, playing in opposite directions, with one disc.
7 players on each team on the pitch at any one time outdoors, 5 indoors.
You cannot travel bipedally or any other way when holding the disc.
The disc may be thrown in any direction.
If the disc is dropped/not caught/intercepted/stalled out (see below) then possession of the disc goes to the other team.
At either end of the pitch there are the End Zones.
To score one point you must be in the oppositions' End Zone and catch the disc.
When each point is scored then the teams swap directions.
The disc cannot be held for more than 10 seconds at a time outside, 8 inside.
If the indicated number of seconds is reached without release of the disc, then that is a Stall Out, possession changes.
All games are self ajudicated, no referees. Disputes must be solved between the players involved.
If a dispute is not resolved, then that play is reset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sanskrit is one of the oldest known languages. It is also regarded as a highly scientific language. It is known for its conciseness, and complexity. 

Many great literary texts, dating milleniums back, have been preserved as it is in Sanskrit. The reason is that the language has maintained its grammar and vocabulary. There have been new words that have been added over time, but the language retains its precise and concise form. The texts have been passed on word-for-word through the centuries. 

A strong formative influence on the Sanskrit language was the grammar of Panini, which regularized and simplified the grammar. The grammatical and linguistic uniformity of some Sanskrit texts comes from editing after the texts were completed to bring them into line with Panini's rules. The epics, in particular, bear traces of such editing.

The Vedas are one such great texts and are worshipped and widely read. 

Various Upanishads, Puranas and Shastras, were all written in Sanskrit and have been completely intact over time. 

Srimad Bhagawad Gita, 
Sri Vishnu Purana,
Sri Bhagawad Purana and so on..

Apart from those, many ancient texts were written in Sanskrit and are available today.

In addition to religious and philosophical texts, the tradition of Kavya court poetry flourished from maybe the sixth to the ninth century. Kavi is hot-house poetry: it prizes exotic imagery, recherche allusions, and, above all, word play. 

Related to the Kavya tradition is the great poet Kalidasa, who is known above all as a poet and dramatist. His poetry shares many characteristics with Kavi, and his plays have a certain similarity of sensibility with Kavya poetry. The Abhijnaanasakuntalam retells a story from the Mahabharata, where the king Dushyanta falls in love with Sakuntala, forgets his love for her by coming in contact with a cursed ring, has a series of adventures and after a long period of time is reunited and re-enamored of Sakuntala.

Need to add more words and sentences here. Sentences taken from scriptures and translated here would help in ability to read and understand sanskrit. The target audience of this textbook is probably some one who doesn't know much Sanskrit. Any examples would be helpful here, more than any thing else.  [[User:Chaturganj|Pankaj]]</text>

{{wikipedia|Surface_of_revolution}}

Suppose we are given a function ''f'' and we want to calculate the surface area of the function ''f'' rotated around a given line.  The calculation of surface area of revolution is related to the arc length calculation.

If the function ''f'' is a straight line, other methods such as surface area formulas for cylinders and conical frustra can be used.  However, if ''f'' is not linear, an integration technique must be used.

Recall the formula for the lateral surface area of a conical frustum:

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi r l \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the average radius and ''l'' is the slant height of the frustum.

For ''y=f(x)'' and &lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt;, we divide ''[a,b]'' into subintervals with equal width Δx and endpoints &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;.  We map each point &lt;math&gt;y_i= f(x_i) \,&lt;/math&gt; to a conical frustum of width Δx and lateral surface area &lt;math&gt;A_i \,&lt;/math&gt;.

We can estimate the surface area of revolution with the sum

:&lt;math&gt; A = \sum_{i=0}^{n} A_i &lt;/math&gt;

As we divide ''[a,b]'' into smaller and smaller pieces, the estimate gives a better value for the surface area.

==Definition (Surface of Revolution)==

The surface area of revolution of the curve ''y=f(x)'' about a line for &lt;math&gt;a\le x\le b&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be

&lt;math&gt; A = \lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n} A_i&lt;/math&gt;

==The Surface Area Formula==

Suppose ''f'' is a continuous function on the interval ''[a,b]'' and ''r(x)'' represents the distance from ''f(x)'' to the axis of rotation.  Then the lateral surface area of revolution about a line is given by

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_a^b r(x) \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x))^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

And in Leibniz notation
:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_a^b r(x) \sqrt{ 1+ \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof:'''

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; A \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n A_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n 2 \pi r_i l_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i l_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

As &lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta x \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we know two things:

1. the average radius of each conical frustum &lt;math&gt; r_i &lt;/math&gt; approaches a single value

2. the slant height of each conical frustum &lt;math&gt; l_i &lt;/math&gt; equals an infitesmal segment of arc length

From the arc length formula discussed in the previous section, we know that

:&lt;math&gt; l_i = \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x_i))^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:{|
|&lt;math&gt; A \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i l_i &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n r_i \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x_i))^2} \Delta x &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

Because of the definition of an integral &lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(c_i) \Delta x_i &lt;/math&gt;, we can simplify the sigma operation to an integral.

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_a^b r(x) \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(x))^2 } dx&lt;/math&gt;

Or if ''f'' is in terms of ''y'' on the interval ''[c,d]''

:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \pi \int_c^d r(y) \sqrt{ 1+ (f'(y))^2} dy &lt;/math&gt;

...each floor up gets &lt;strike&gt;progressively&lt;/strike&gt; smaller until you reach the top room...


 I am 13 and I think that instead of using the word ''progressively'' You should say that ''...each floor up gets smaller and smaller...'' 



&lt;strike&gt;Wedge shaped symbols&lt;/strike&gt; were &lt;strike&gt;inscribed&lt;/strike&gt; on clay tablets with a &lt;strike&gt;reed stylus&lt;/strike&gt;...Many neighboring countries later adopted this writing method to record their own language (Eblaites, Hittites, Hurrites, Elamites)

What are ''wedge shaped symbols'' or ''reed stylus''? I sugest giving an example.

''were inscribed on clay tablets'' how about saying were ''carved into'' clay tablets.



...it was overcome by neighboring &lt;strike&gt;city-states&lt;/strike&gt;...

You might want to explain what a ''city-state'' is.

:[[User:Bdavis|Bdavis]]

i think it's not fair to say jews and arabs , no offense to jews but i think arabs represent many semitic groups and jews are not as many as them also not to forget arabs are modern compared to their ancient ancestors.and logically AND is considered commutative so no big deal.

== Quantity vs Numbers ==

An important distinction must be made between &quot;Quantities&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot;. A quantity is simply some amount of &quot;stuff&quot;; five apples, three pounds, and one automobile are all quantities of different things. A quantity can be represented by any number of different representations. For example, tick-marks on a piece of paper, beads on a string, or stones in a pocket can all represent some quantity of something. One of the most familiar representations are the base-10 (or &quot;decimal&quot;) numbers, which consist of 10 digits, from 0 to 9. When more than 9 objects needs to be counted, we make a new column with a 1 in it (which represents a group of 10), and we continue counting from there.

Computers, however, cannot count in decimal. Computer hardware uses a system where values are represented internally as a series of voltage differences. For example, in most computers, a +5V charge is represented as a &quot;1&quot; digit, and a 0V value is represented as a &quot;0&quot; digit. There are no other digits possible! Thus, computers must use a numbering system that has only two digits(0 and 1): the &quot;Binary&quot;, or &quot;base-2&quot;, number system.

== Binary Numbers ==

Understanding the binary number system is difficult for many students at first. It may help to start with a decimal number, since that is more familiar. It is possible to write a number like 1234 in &quot;expanded notation,&quot; so that the value of each place is shown:

&lt;math&gt;1234_{10} = 1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 3 \times 10^1 + 4 \times 10^0 = 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that each digit is multiplied by successive powers of 10, since this a decimal, or ''base 10'' system. The &quot;ones&quot; digit (&quot;4&quot; in the example) is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;10^0&lt;/math&gt;, or &quot;1&quot;. Each digit to the left of the &quot;ones&quot; digit is multiplied by the next higher power of 10 and that is added to the preceding value.

Now, do the same with a binary number; but since this is a &quot;base 2&quot; number, replace powers of 10 with powers of 2:

&lt;math&gt;1011_2 = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 11_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

The subscripts indicate the base. Note that in the above equations:

&lt;math&gt;1011_2 = 11_{10}&lt;/math&gt; 

Binary numbers ''are the same as their equivalent decimal numbers,'' they are just a different way to represent a given quantity. To be very simplistic, it does not really matter if you have &lt;math&gt;1011_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;11_{10}&lt;/math&gt; apples, you can still make a pie.

== Bits ==

The term '''Bits''' is short for the phrase '''B'''inary Dig'''its'''. Each bit is a single binary value: 1 or zero. Computers generally represent a 1 as a positive voltage (5 volts or 3.3 volts are common values), and a zero as 0 volts.

=== Most Significant Bit and Least Significant Bit ===

In the decimal number 48723, the &quot;4&quot; digit represents the largest power of 10 (or &lt;math&gt;10^4&lt;/math&gt;), and the 3 digit represents the smallest power of 10 (&lt;math&gt;10^0&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, in this number, 4 is the most significant digit and 3 is the least significant digit. Consider a situation where a caterer needs to prepare 156 meals for a wedding. If the caterer makes an error in the least significant digit and accidentally makes 157 meals, it is  not a big problem. However, if the caterer makes a mistake on the most significant digit, 1, and prepares 256 meals, that will be a big problem!

Now, consider a binary number: 101011. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is the left-most bit, because it represents the greatest power of 2 (&lt;math&gt;2^5&lt;/math&gt;). The Least Significant Bit (LSB) is the right-most bit and represents the least power of 2 (&lt;math&gt;2^0&lt;/math&gt;).

Notice that MSB and LSB are not the same as the notion of &quot;significant figures&quot; that is used in other sciences. The decimal number 123000 has only 3 significant figures, but the most significant digit is 1 (the left-most digit), and the least significant digit is 0 (the right-most digit).

;Nibble : a Nibble is 4 bits long. Nibbles can hold values from 0 to 15 (in decimal).

;Byte : a Byte is 8 bits long. Bytes can hold values from 0 to 255 (in decimal).

;Word : a Word is 16 bits, or 2 bytes long. Words can hold values from 0 to 65535 (in Decimal). There is occasionally some confusion between this definition and that of a &quot;machine word&quot;. See Machine Word below.

;Double-word : a Double-word is 2 words long, or 4 bytes long. These are also known simply as &quot;DWords&quot;. DWords are also 32 bits long. 32-bit computers therefore, manipulate data that is the size of DWords.

;Quad-word : a Quad-word is 2 DWords long, 4 words long, and 8 bytes long. They are known simply as &quot;QWords&quot;. QWords are 64 bits long, and are therefore the default data size in 64-bit computers.

;Machine Word : A machine word is the length of the standard data size of a given machine. For instance, a 32-bit computer has a 32-bit machine word. Likewise 64-bit computers have a 64-bit machine word. Occasionally the term &quot;machine word&quot; is shortened to simply &quot;word&quot;, leaving some ambiguity as to whether we are talking about a regular &quot;word&quot; or a machine word.

== Negative Numbers ==

It would seem logical that to create a negative number in binary, the reader would only need to prefix the number with a &quot;–&quot; sign. For instance, the binary number 1101 can become negative simply by writing it as &quot;–1101&quot;. This seems all fine and dandy until you realize that computers and digital circuits do not understand minus sign. Digital circuits only have bits, and so bits must be used to distinguish between positive and negative numbers. With this in mind, there are a variety of schemes that are used to make binary numbers negative or positive: Sign and Magnitude, One's Complement, and Two's Complement.

=== Sign and Magnitude ===

Under a '''Sign and Magnitude''' scheme, the MSB of a given binary number is used as a &quot;flag&quot; to determine if the number is positive or negative. If the MSB = 0, the number is positive, and if the MSB = 1, the number is negative. This scheme seems awfully simple, except for one simple fact: arithmetic of numbers under this scheme is very hard. Let's say we have 2 nibbles: 1001 and 0111. Under sign and magnitude, we can translate them to read: -001 and +111. In decimal then, these are the numbers –1 and +7.

When we add them together, the sum of –1 + 7 = 6 should be the value that we get. However:

  001
 +111
 ----
  000

And that isn't right. What we need is a decision-making construct to determine if the MSB is set or not, and if it is set, we subtract, and if it is not set, we add. This is a big pain, and therefore sign and magnitude is not used.

=== One's Complement ===

Let's now examine a scheme where we define a negative number as being the logical inverse of a positive number. We will use the same &quot;!&quot; operator to express a logical inversion on multiple bits. For instance, !001100 = 110011. 110011 is binary for 51, and 001100 is binary for 12. but in this case, we are saying that 001100 = –110011, or 110011(binary) = -12 decimal. let's perform the addition again:

  001100 (12)
 +110011 (-12)
 -------
  111111

We can see that if we invert 000000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we get the value 111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. and therefore 111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is negative zero! What exactly is negative zero? it turns out that in this scheme, positive zero and negative zero are identical.

However, one's complement notation suffers because it has two representations for zero: all 0 bits, or all 1 bits. As well as being clumsy, this will also cause problems when we want to check quickly to see if a number is zero. This is an extremely common operation, and we want it to be easy, so we create a new representation, two's complement.

=== Two's Complement ===

Two's complement is a number representation that is very similar to one's complement. We find the negative of a number X using the following formula:

 -X = !X + 1

Let's do an example. If we have the binary number 11001 (which is 25 in decimal), and we want to find the representation for -25 in twos complement, we follow two steps:

#Invert the numbers:
#:11001 → 00110
#Add 1:
#:00110 + 1 = 00111

Therefore –11001 = 00111. Let's do a little addition:

  11001
 +00111
 ------
  00000

Now, there is a carry from adding the two MSBs together, but this is digital logic, so we discard the carrys. It is important to remember that digital circuits have capacity for a certain number of bits, and any extra bits are discarded.

Most modern computers use two's complement.

Below is a diagram showing the representation held by these systems for all four-bit combinations:

[[image:Binary Representations.svg|center]]

== Signed vs Unsigned ==

One important fact to remember is that computers are dumb. A computer doesnt know whether or not a given set of bits represents a signed number, or an unsigned number (or, for that matter, and number of other data objects). It is therefore important for the programmer (or the programmers trusty compiler) to keep track of this data for us. Consider the bit pattern 100110:

*Unsigned: 38 (decimal)
*Sign+Magnitude: -6
*One's Complement: -25
*Two's Complement: -26

See how the representation we use changes the value of the number! It is important to understand that bits are bits, and the computer doesn't know what the bits represent. It is up to the circuit designer and the programmer to keep track of what the numbers mean.

== Character Data ==

We've seen how binary numbers can represent unsigned values, and how they can represent negative numbers using various schemes. But now we have to ask ourselves, how do binary numbers represent other forms of data, like text characters? The answer is that there exist different schemes for converting binary data to characters. Each scheme acts like a map to convert a certain bit pattern into a certain character. There are 3 popular schemes: ASCII, UNICODE and EBCDIC.

=== ASCII === 

The ASCII code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common code for mapping bits to characters. ASCII uses only 7 bits, although since computers can only deal with 8-bit bytes at a time, ASCII characters have an unused 8th bit as the MSB. ASCII codes 0-31 are &quot;Control codes&quot; which are characters that are not printable to the screen, and are used by the computer to handle certain operations. code 32 is a single space (hit the space bar). The character code for the character '1' is 49, '2' is 50, etc... notice in ASCII '2' = '1' + 1 (the character 1 plus the integer number 1)). This is difficult for many people to grasp at first, so don't worry if you are confused.

Capital letters start with 'A' = 65 to 'Z' = 90. The lower-case letters start with 'a' = 97 to 'z' = 122.

Almost all the rest of the ASCII codes are different punctuation marks.

=== Extended ASCII ===

Since computers use data that is the size of bytes, it made no sense to have ASCII only contain 7 bits of data (which is a maximum of 128 character codes). Many companies therefore incorporated the extra bit into an &quot;Extended ASCII&quot; code set. These extended sets have a maximum of 256 characters to use. The first 128 characters are the original ASCII characters, but the next 128 characters are platform-defined. Each computer maker could define their own characters to fill in the last 128 slots.

=== UNICODE === 

When computers began to spread around the world, other languages began to be used by computers. Before too long, each country had its own character code sets, to represent their own letters. It is important to remember that some alphabets in the world have more than 256 characters! Therefore, the UNICODE standard was proposed. There are many different representations of UNICODE. Some of them use 2-byte characters, and others use different representations. The first 128 characters of the UNICODE set are the original ASCII characters.

For a more in-depth discussion of UNICODE, see [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html this website].

=== EBCDIC ===

EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange format) is a character code that was originally proposed by IBM, but was passed in favor of ASCII. IBM however still uses EBCDIC in some of its super computers, mainframes, and server systems.

== Octal ==

Octal is just like decimal and binary in that once one column is &quot;full&quot;, you move onto the next. It uses the numbers 0−7 as digits, and because there a binary multiple (8=2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of digits available, it has a useful property that it is easy to convert between octal and binary numbers. Consider the binary number: 101110000. To convert this number to octal, we must first break it up into groups of 3 bits: 101, 110, 000. Then we simply add up the values of each bit:

*&lt;math&gt;101_2 = 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 5_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;110_2 = 1 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 6_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;000_2 = 0_8&lt;/math&gt;

And then we string all the octal digits together:
:101110000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 560&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Hexadecimal ==

Hexadecimal is a very common data representation. It is more common than octal, because it represents four binary digits per digit, and many digital circuits use multiples of four as their data widths.

Hexadecimal uses a base of 16. However, there is a difficulty in that it requires 16 digits, and the common decimal number system only has ten digits to play with (0 through 9). So, to have the necessary number of digits to play with, we use the letters A through F, in addition to the digits 0-9. After the unit column is full, we move onto the &quot;16's&quot; column, just as in binary and decimal.

| D || 13 || 15 || 1101
|-
| E || 14 || 16 || 1110
|-
| F || 15 || 17 || 1111
|}

== Hexadecimal Notation ==

Depending on the source code you are reading, hexadecimal may be notated in one of several ways:

*&lt;tt&gt;0xaa11&lt;/tt&gt;: ANSI C notation. The &lt;tt&gt;0x&lt;/tt&gt; prefix indicates that the remaining digits are to be interpreted as hexadeximal. For example, &lt;tt&gt;0x1000&lt;/tt&gt;, which is equal to 4096 in decimal.

*&lt;tt&gt;\xaa11&lt;/tt&gt;: &quot;C string&quot; notation.

*&lt;tt&gt;0aa11h&lt;/tt&gt;: Typical assembly language notation, indicated by the &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; suffix.  The leading &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; (zero) ensures the assembler does not mistakenly interpret the number as a label or symbol.

*&lt;tt&gt;$aa11&lt;/tt&gt;: Another common assembly language notation, widely used in 6502/65816 assembly language programming.

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#AA11&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: BASIC notation.

*&lt;tt&gt;$aa11$&lt;/tt&gt;: Business BASIC notation.

*&lt;tt&gt;aa11&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: Mathematical notation, with the subscript indicating the number base.

*&lt;tt&gt;16'hAA11&lt;/tt&gt;: [[:w:Verilog|Verilog]] notation, where the &quot;16&quot; is the total length in bits.

Both uppercase and lowercase letters may be used. Lowercase is generally preferred in a Linux, UNIX or C environment, while uppercase is generally preferred in a mainframe or COBOL environment.

The following is a skeleton for the content of D1 algorithms, with the content taken from AQA, OCR, OCR MEI and Edexcel's specifications. Not all specifications include all of the following content.

==Introduction to Algorithms==

===What is an algorithm?===
An algorithm is a precise set of instructions which, when followed, will solve a problem. They can be presented in various forms, e.g. words, pictures, flow diagrams. Recipes, knitting patterns, instructions to set a VCR or build a desk are all examples of algorithms we may encounter in everyday life.
 
===Why use algorithms?===
The main advantage of algorithms is that we can then use computational methods of solving problems. It's rather easy for one to put the numbers 2, 5, 3, 1 and 4 in ascending order, but it would take much, much longer for one to sort a list of 1000 random numbers. Also having an algorithm means that someone else can achieve the same result as you, without having to work out how to do it. Specifically having an algorithm may allow a computer to perform the actions.

===Order===

===Flow Diagrams===
[[Image:BasicFlowDiagram.png|right|Basic Flow Diagram]]
You may need to be able to follow or create flow diagrams in order to demonstrate an algorithm. There are three basic shapes used:

* Oval, used for start &amp; stop and input &amp; output.
* Rectangle, used for calculations and instructions.
* Diamond, used for yes/no questions.
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

==Sorting Algorithms==

====An example====
Given a deck of 52 cards to be sorted according to their suit; their position in the current sequence of cards is given a number:
#What suit is card 1? It is HEARTS.
#What suit is card 2? It is SPADES. We want a deck with spades before hearts. Therefore we exchange the two cards, and go back one step. If we are already at the beginning, then ignore the need to go back one step.
#What suit is card 1 now? It is SPADES.
#What suit is card 2 now? It is HEARTS. These two cards are in the right order, therefore we do NOT interchange them, but go to the next card in the deck.
#What suit is card 3? It is HEARTS. It is the same as the previous card, therefore we carry on to the next card in the deck.
...........
AND SO ON, until we get to the card that is one before the last card. We compare, exchange if necessary, and then stop sorting.
*Next we separate the HEARTS, or some other suit, as we wish, from the 52-card deck, have now only a deck of 13 cards, and sort this smaller deck of cards according to 2,3, ... J,Q,K,A and do this with the other 3 suits too, one at a time.
*After that we are nearly all done, combine the 4 sets of 13 cards each into a big set of 52 cards and stop.

===Bubble Sort===
For a set of numbers, the first number is compared to the number to the right of it. &lt;br&gt;

13, 2, 4, 3, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&gt;2 so it moves to the right. &lt;br&gt;

2, 13, 4, 3, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&gt;4 so it moves to the right. &lt;br&gt;

2, 4, 13, 3, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&gt;3 so it moves to the right.&lt;br&gt;

2, 4, 3, 13, 82&lt;br&gt;

13&lt;82 so it stays.&lt;br&gt;

At the end of first pass: 2, 4, 3, 13, 82&lt;br&gt;
At the end of second pass: 2, 4, 3, 13, 82&lt;br&gt;
At the end of third pass: 2, 3, 4, 13 82&lt;br&gt;

This set only needed 2 passes, but on a larger data set it can get quite large. The maximum number of passes is equal to the size of the set, provided the set items are unique.

===Shuttle Sort===
From a set of numbers, one selects the first two numbers and underlines them. These two are the ones that get sorted in the first pass.&lt;br&gt;
In the second pass, the range of numbers to be sorted increases by one, so the first three numbers are compared and sorted into their order. &lt;br&gt;
And so forth until all the numbers are covered in the range and sorted. &lt;br&gt;
1st pass - &lt;u&gt;23, 2&lt;/u&gt;, 4, 8, 9  - 23&gt;2 so 2 is sorted to the left.&lt;br&gt;
2nd pass - &lt;u&gt;2, 23, 4&lt;/u&gt;, 8, 9  - 23&gt;4 so 4 is sorted to the left.&lt;br&gt;
3rd pass - &lt;u&gt;2, 4, 23, 8&lt;/u&gt;, 9 - The numbers are sorted&lt;br&gt;
4th pass - &lt;u&gt;2, 4, 8, 23, 9&lt;/u&gt; - The numbers are sorted&lt;br&gt;
Final set of numbers = 2, 4, 8, 9, 23 - The numbers are sorted&lt;br&gt;

===Quick Sort===
Using the midpoint as the pivot, (or whichever value it asks you to use in the question) perform a shuttle sort on each of the sub lists. Continue until all terms but one have been used as a pivot.

===Insertion Sort===

===Shell Sort===
* Divide the set of numbers in n/2 sublists. 
* The sublists are shuttle sorted
* The data range is recombined and split into half the number of the previous sublists.
* The data range are shuttle sorted again.
* Repeat until the number of sublists = 2

==Packing Algorithms==

===Full-Bin===
The 'full bin' algorithm is one in which combinations of objects which would fill a 'bin' are grouped together to fill as few bins as possible. The remaining objects are then placed in other bins.
This is best illustrated by the example below (NB - this is NOT an exam question and does not represent the level of complexity that can be expected on the actual paper).

Q) A computer software company needs to publish its software on floppy disks of capacity 200kB. The files are of size 25kB, 90kB, 30kB, 120kB, 190kB, 10kB, 70kB, 40kB, 100kB, 140kB and 80kB. How many floppy disks are required? Use the 'full-bin' algorithm to arrive at a solution.

A) Start by looking along the list to find values that add up to 200. There is no particular method for this (everyone seems to do it differently), but I find it helps to find combinations that add up to full 10's etc. Fill the 'bins' with these combinations:

Bin | Files
-------------
A   | 120, 80
-------------
B   | 190, 10
-------------
C   | 70, 40, 90
-------------

This leaves 25, 30, 100 and 140. It makes sense to get as close as possible to a full bin using the remaining values:

(140 + 25 + 30) = 195 &lt;- so place these values in the next bin, leaving the 100 in the final bin.

Solution:

Bin | Files
-------------
A   | 120, 80
-------------
B   | 190, 10
-------------
C   | 70, 40, 90
-------------
D   | 140, 25, 30
-------------
E   | 100
-------------

5 disks are required to fit all the files.

===First-Fit===
Place each object, in turn, in the first available space in which it will fit.

===First-Fit Decreasing===
Reorder the boxes in ''decreasing'' order of size using one of the sorting algorithms, before applying the first-fit algorithm to the reordered list.

==Searching Algorithms==

===Binary Search===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Government of Canada had a significant interest to encourage people with valuable skills to immigrate to Canada. It was for this reason that they created the Federal Skilled Worker class of immigrant to allow those with sufficient language skills, education, and experience in an occupation that is needed in Canada, to enter the country.

==Basic requirements==
An applicant under the Federal Skilled Worker program need not have a job already, but only must show that they are skilled enough to contribute to Canada.

==Application procedure==

To be eligable to apply as a Federal Skilled Worker the applicant must:
* be 18 years old or more.
* meet the required amount of assets given the size of the family.
* have a score of at least 67 on the required factors.
* have a medical examination and security clearance for the applicant and all dependants. 


===Minimum Assets===
The applicant must show that they possess a minimum amount of assets in their bank account. The amount depends on the number of family members. These amounts can be waived if the applicant already has arranged employment.

|}
[table last checked on March 24, 2006]

===Point System===
Acceptance to the federal skilled worker program depends entirely on the score awarded from a set of criteria. An applicant needs at least a score of 67 combined from the points calculated from five factors: Education (max 25pts), Language Skills (max 24pts), Experience Age(max 21pts), Arranged Employment (max 10pts), and Adaptability (max 10pts).


===Alternative to the point system===
In the case where the applicant does not have the required number of points, they may still make a request for &quot;Substituted Evaluation&quot;. The immigration officer has the discretion to accept an applicant if the applicant can show that they are able to become &quot;economically established&quot; in Canada.

===Forms===
The government offers a [http://web.archive.org/web/20030307235622/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/EG7.pdf guide] to fill out the application, much of which will mirror what is in this section.

The following are the forms that are needed:

==Processing times==
All applications are mailed to the processing center in Buffalo, New York.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Jurisdiction ==

The ECJ was quick to stamp its authority in a series of cases clarifying the position of the different types of legislation made by the institutions of the European Community.

The first case was Van Gend en Loos which established that EC law is supreme over existing Dutch law. 

;Costa v. ENEL
:New conflicting national legislation made after EC law could not override EC law.

;Internationalle Handelgesellschaft
:EC law prevailed even over conflicting constitutional law. In this case it was German Basic Law, note that the German Administrative Court ignored the ECJ's ruling.

;Simmenthal Spa
:Conflicting national law could be disapplied immediately without waiting for it to be repealed.

{{recipe}}

Basic recipe on how to cook artichokes.  Similar results can be obtained using the [[Cookbook:Steamed Artichoke|steamed artichoke recipe]], however, using the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]] is much faster.

==Ingredients==
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], juiced
*[[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*;Seasonings (optional)
**[[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
**1-2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] cloves per artichoke
**[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
**1/8 cup (30 ml) white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

==Procedure==

#Cut off top 1/3 of the artichoke, and all but 1 inch of the stem.
#Remove base leaves and cut off the tips of the higher leaves.
#Sprinkle artichoke with lemon juice to preserve color.
#Place artichoke stem up in a microwave safe dish tall enough to place lid without touching the artichoke.
#Fill dish with 1 inch (3 cm) of water and any of the optional seasonings.
#Cover and microwave on high for 6-8 minutes, and allow to rest for 1-2 minutes.  The artichoke is cooked when a [[Cookbook:Paring knife|paring knife]] can be inserted into the heart without resistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Environment|Environment]] module we introduced the idea of an environment variable as a general way of storing small pieces of data. In this module we take an in-depth look at using those variables: 'variable expansion', 'parameter substitution' or just 'substitution'.

==Substitution==
The reason that using a variable is called substitution is that the shell literally replaces each reference to any variable with its value. This is done while evaluating the command-line, which means that the variable substitution is made ''before'' the command is actually executed.

The simplest way of using a variable is the way we've already seen, prepending the variable name with a '$'. So for instance:

{{code:Output|Simple use of a variable|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ USER=JoeSixpack
$ echo $USER&lt;/source&gt;
|JoeSixpack
|The value JoeSixpack is substituted for $USER before the echo command is executed.}}

Of course, once the substitution is made the result is still just the text that was in the variable. The interpretation of that text is still done by whatever program is run. So for example:

{{code:Output|Variables do not make magic|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ USER=JoeSixpack
$ ls $USER&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: cannot access JoeSixpack: No such file or directory
|Just because the text came from a variable, doesn't mean the file exists.}}

Basic variable expansion is already quite flexible. You can use it as described above, but you can also use variables to create longer strings. For instance, if you want to set the log directory for an application to the &quot;log&quot; directory in your home directory, you might fill in the setting like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$HOME/log&lt;/source&gt;

And if you're going to use that setting more often, you might want to create your own variable like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;LOGDIR=$HOME/log&lt;/source&gt;

And, of course, if you want specific subdirectories for logs for different programs, then the logs for the Wyxliz application go into directory

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$LOGDIR/Wyxliz/&lt;/source&gt;

==Substitution forms==
The Bourne Shell has a number of different syntaxes for variable substitution, each with its own meaning and use. In this section we examine these syntaxes.

===Basic variable substitution===
We've already talked at length about basic variable substitution: you define a variable, stick a '$' in front of it, the shell substitutes the value for the variable. By now you're probably bored of hearing about it.

But we've not talked about one situation that you might run into with basic variable substitution. Consider the following:

{{code:Output|Adding some text to a variable's value|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ANIMAL=duck
$ echo One $ANIMAL, two $ANIMALs&lt;/source&gt;
|One duck, two
|Uhhh.... we're missing something...}}

So what went wrong here? Well, obviously the shell substituted nothing for the ANIMAL variable, but why? Because with the extra 's' the shell thought we were asking for the non-existent ANIMALs variable. But what gives there? We've used variables in the middle of strings before (as in '/home/ANIMAL/logs'). But an 's' is not a '/': an 's' can be a valid part of a variable name, so the shell cannot tell the difference. In cases where you explicitly have to separate the variable from other text, you can use braces:

{{code:Output|Adding some text to a variable's value, take II|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ANIMAL=duck
$ echo One $ANIMAL, two ${ANIMAL}s&lt;/source&gt;
|One duck, two ducks
|That's better!}}

Both cases (with and without the braces) count as basic variable substitution and the rules are exactly the same. Just remember not to leave any spaces between the braces and the variable name.

===Substitution with a default value===
Since a variable can be empty, you'll often write code in your scripts to check that mandatory variables actually have a value. But in the case of optional variables it is usually more convenient not to check, but to use a default value for the case that a variable is not defined. This case is actually so common that the Bourne Shell defines a special syntax for it: the dash. Since a dash can mean other things to the shell as well, you have to combine it with braces &amp;mdash; the final result looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]-''default''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''default'' is the value used if ''varname'' is not defined}}

Again, don't leave any spaces between the braces and the rest of the text. The way to use this syntax is as follows:

{{code:Output|Default values|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ THIS_ONE_SET=Hello
$ echo $THIS_ONE_SET ${THIS_ONE_NOT:-World}&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World|}}

Compare that to this:

{{code:Output|Default not needed|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ TEXT=aaaaaahhhhhhhh
$ echo Say ${TEXT:-bbbbbbbbbb}&lt;/source&gt;
|Say aaaaaahhhhhhhh|}}

Interestingly, the colon is optional; so ${VAR:-default} has the same result as ${VAR-default}.

===Substitution with default assignment===
As an extension to default values, there's a syntax that not only supplies a default value but assigns it to the unset variable at the same time. It looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''default''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''default'' is the value used '''and assigned''' if ''varname'' is not defined}}

As usual, avoid spaces in between the braces. Here's an example that demonstrates how this syntax works:

{{code:Basic|Default value assignment
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo $NEWVAR

$ echo ${NEWVAR:=newval}
newval
$ echo $NEWVAR
newval&lt;/source&gt;}}

As with the default value syntax, the colon is optional.

===Substitution for actual value===
This substitution is sort of a quick test to see if a variable is defined (and that's usually what it's used for). It's sort of the reverse of the default value syntax and looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]+''substitute''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''substitute'' is the value used if ''varname'' is defined}}

This syntax returns the substitute value if the variable '''is''' defined. That sounds counterintuitive at first, especially if you ask what is returned if the variable is '''not''' defined &amp;mdash; and learn that the value is nothing. Here's an example:

{{code:Basic|Actual value substitution
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo ${NEWVAR:+newval}

$ NEWVAR=oldval
$ echo ${NEWVAR:+newval}
newval&lt;/source&gt;}}

So what could possibly be the use of this notation? Well, it's used often in scripts that have to check whether lots of variables are set or not. In this case the fact that a variable has a value means that a certain option has been activated, so you're interested in knowing that the variable ''has'' a value, not what that value is. It looks sort of like this (pseudocode, this won't actually work in the shell):

{{code:Basic|Default value assignment|if ${SPECIFIC_OPTION_VAR:+optionset} &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt; optionset then ...}}

Of course, in this notation the colon is optional as well.

===Substitution with value check===
This final syntax is sort of a debug check to check whether or not a variable is set. It looks like this:

{{bcode:Example
|'''${'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''varname''[:]?''message''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''}'''
|Where ''varname'' is the name of the variable&lt;br/&gt;
and ''message'' is the printed if ''varname'' is not defined}}

With this syntax, if the variable is defined everything is okay. Otherwise, the message is printed and the command or script exits with a non-zero exit status. Or, if there is no message, the text &quot;parameter null or not set&quot; is printed. As usual the colon is optional and you may not have a space between the colon and the variable name.

You can use this syntax to check that the mandatory variables for your scripts have been set and to print an error message if they are not.

{{code:Basic|Default value assignment
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ echo ${SOMEVAR:?has not been set}
-sh: SOMEVAR: has not been set
$ echo ${SOMEVAR:?}
-sh: SOMEVAR: parameter null or not set&lt;/source&gt;}}

*sample vocabulary list:
**おはようございます: good morning (formal)
**おはよう: good morning (informal)
**こんにちは: good day
**こんばんは: good evening

*sample activity:
**Practice greeting other students based on the current time of day. What would you say to someone if you ran into them six hours from now?
**What would you say if you were speaking to a social superior, such as your teacher? What would you say to a close acquaintance?
**If you are alone, practice thinking of people in your life and how you would great them differently. Say each greeting phrase out loud as you think of the person.

==Common Japanese Greetings (sample cultural note)==
Much like English, the Japanese use different greetings for different times of day. Also like English, the Japanese use a different, more formal set of greetings when dealing with people of differing social levels. Where in English you might say &quot;mornin'&quot; to your friends and &quot;good morning&quot; to your instructors, the Japanese instead choose between おはよう (for less-formal relationships) and おはようございます (for social superiors or more formalized relationships).

As in English, the greeting expressions have a direct relationship to the idea being expressed, but not necessarily the same thing that would be literally translated. As examples:

{| style=&quot;width: auto; border: 1px #333 solid; background-color: #f2f2f2; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| 今日は。
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid; width: 60%;&quot;| &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;今&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;こん&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rb&gt;日&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;にち&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; (today) は (topic marker)
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| Good day.
|- 
| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| 今晩は。|| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;| &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;今&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;こん&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rb&gt;晩&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;ばん&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt; (tonight) は (topic marker)|| style=&quot;border-bottom: 1px #aaaaaa solid;&quot;|Good night.
|-
| | おはようございます。|| お (honorific) &lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;早&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;rp&gt;(&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;はよ&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;)&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;う ([[Japanese:Grammar:Some Fancy Adjective Conjugation|some fancy conjugation]] of &quot;early&quot;) ございます (it is, very polite)|| Good morning.
|}

If walking up to someone and announcing that it is, in fact, early seems like an odd greeting, think about some of the many varied things that English speakers accept without a second thought: &quot;Top of the morning to you.&quot;; &quot;Howdy.&quot;; and &quot;G'mornin'.&quot; to name a few.

There are other subtle differences not clearly shown by the literal translations above. Where in English, you would wish someone in the late night hours (midnight until sunrise) &quot;good morning&quot;, the Japanese consider this time period an extension of the evening and therefore will greet each other with こんばんは.

[[Image:Pixareyes-iris blueeye.png|thumb|The final result, with a blue iris.]]
Note: This tutorial uses the same modelling and texturing technique described in the well-known MAX tutorial by Adam Baroody (http://www.3dluvr.com/rogueldr/tutorials/eye/eyes.html). The sole purpose of my tutorial is to make this technique more popular among the Blender users by explaining how to achieve the same result with Blender.

The goal of this tutorial is to make a Pixar-looking eye. One of the main reasons that Pixar's characters really convey life is in their eyes. They have depth, you can see how the eye not only shines but it &quot;collects&quot; light. You may think that you can't achieve this effect without raytracing but you're wrong. The secret of this depth is in the modelling of the eye. Let's see how it works!

==Parts of the Eye==
In this picture you can see the &quot;ingredients&quot; of the eye model. The blue mesh at the left is the cornea. Its shape allows for a small spot of specular light to appear on it even if the light is in a far side position. The mesh next to it is the iris. Now notice how it's a bit concave. That's the tricky part - the shape of the iris allows for a wide soft specular light to appear at the opposite side of the lamp direction. This fakes refracted light from the cornea and makes the illusion of &quot;collecting&quot; light and creates depth. The next mesh is the eye pupil - a simple circle.The pupil size is the same size as the iris hole. You can position it close to the inner side of the iris. And finally - the eyeball. It's a simple sphere with a hole in it.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: left; height: 20px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

I won't go deep into modelling of each element - it uses Blender's subdivision surfaces and it's quite simple as you can see.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Pixareyes-Eye_mesh.gif]]

==Materials==
Now let's look at the materials. 

===Sclera===

To make the eye white, press NUM3 to go into side view and add a UVsphere with 8 segments and 8 rings. To create the hole at the front of the eyeball, delete the 8 triangular faces that make up one end of the eyeball. Ctrl+Tab+3 to go into face select mode, B for border mode and select the middle 8 triangles as shown below, press Delete or the X button and LMB on Faces.

[[Image:Cornea-example.jpg]]

The resulting hole will be ringed by 8 vertices (which you could subsequently extrude and use to help you model the sections below - just a suggestion for those who feel capable)

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera eye white] has white color and high values for Spec and Hard (depends on the lighting), as well as a moderately high Ref value (0.700 - 0.800). Optionally you can use a reflection map to make it look more wet but I usually don't do this.

(Noob note: Using a Phong specular shader turned to work quite well.)

(User: Make sure shadow buttons are off or it will black out the iris. Spec and Hard are located in the Shaders tab.)

===Iris===

* Loop select the opening of the eye (ALT+RMB click edge of opening).

* Duplicate the loop (SHIFT+DKEY). Move the new loop away from the eye a bit perpendicular to the opening. 

* With the loop still selected, extrude (EKEY). Without moving the extrusion, press ENTER.

* Resize by half (SKEY then .KEY then NUM5 then ENTER).

* Move the inner loop back toward the eye a bit to form the concave shape.

* Create a [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material|new material]] and create a [[Blender 3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Quickie_Texture |new texture]] called iris. Then hit F6 or click the spotty square icon [[File:Blendertexture.png]] to open the texture panel, choose Image as the texture type and then press Load Image button and use the image below.&lt;br&gt;





 [[Image:Pixareyes-iriscoloredit.png|Setting the iris color.]]

Here is the eye texture taken from the picture above
[[Image:Iris.png|The iris]]

'''Alternatively''', you can create an image like this procedurally, using the technique described [https://vimeo.com/9295010 here].


All that is required now is a bit of tweaking of the texture size using the Xsize and Ysize values in the Map Input tab, and scaling the pupil hole size in Edit mode.  Also please remember to change in the map input settings from 'flat' to 'cube'.
You can tweak the RGB values and brightness/contrast of the image to achieve the appearance you want. Use a smaller value for Hard (about 50) otherwise you'll have a too shiny look instead of soft specular that fakes refracted light. The Spec value depends on the energy and distance of the light that illuminates it. Generally you'll need to take care that the refracted light on the iris should be no more than half as bright as the small specular spot on the cornea - otherwise you'll achieve the bad effect of two specular spots. Oh, another important thing - join the four meshes before tweaking the texture coordinates. Otherwise you'll have to do the job twice after you join them, because the texture space is changed. And activate shadeless button.

===Pupil===
The material for the pupil is a simple black color with the &quot;shadeless&quot; button on.

===Cornea===
The cornea uses a transparent material ('''alpha = 0.1''') with '''Spec = .6''', '''Hard = 255''' and '''SpecTra = 1'''. &quot;'''Ztransp'''&quot; should also be turned on (found under Links and Pipelines tab). The cornea is simply a piece that fits exactly in the middle of the hole in the eye white. Make sure that the 'Traceable' button, under Render Pipeline, in the Links and Pipelines tab, is switched off. Noob note: I found it helps to turn off Shadebuff since, as far as I know, you don't generally want the cornea to cast a shadow.


Noob question: I don't know where is the &quot;SpecTra&quot; Value. I'm working on 2.46. Thanks a lot.
You can find &quot;SpecTra&quot; under &quot;Mirror Transp&quot;

Noob Question: My cornea isn't transparent. I don't know where Traceable is since I'm using 2.6x

Noob answer:  This applies to 2.6.  Something that doesn't seem to be mentioned in this tutorial (sorry if it is and I missed it) is the cornea's shadow settings.  If it casts a shadow, it will block out everything inside the eye.  So under the the cornea's Material-&gt;Shadow settings uncheck the cast box.

Another option is to leave the cast box in your cornea on, and change to shadow setting in your iris.  Check the Receive Transparent, and that works just as well.

==Lighting==
The lighting is simple - move the eye to a new layer, create a new lamp and make the lamp affect only this layer. Position the lamp at a good angle so you have a small shiny spot of specular light on one side of the iris and a soft spot of &quot;refracted&quot; light on the other side. You can use a backlight to prevent the eyeball from being too dark at the non-illuminated part.

To move the newly created lamp to a new layer, press SHIFT+M and select the second blue button and press OK. P

Noob Question: Why do you need to create a new layer?

Noob Answer: It's just meant to prevent cluttering in your main workspace. It's completely optional.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: left; height: 20px;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

That's it! Now you're (almost) ready to start with character animation. You have a nice eye, now you only need a character for it!

==Changing the Eye Color==
You can change the color of the eye by either changing the cornea color, or by changing the iris color itself.  Changing the cornea color might be like putting on colored contacts.

===Changing the Cornea Color===
To change the cornea color, do the following:

#In the mesh which is used to create Cornea set the value of the alpha slider to 0.2 (or more if you desire)
#Change the color of the mesh to whatever color you like
#Turn off traceble &lt;br&gt; [[Image:settings1.jpg]]
#Render!
(and remember to smooth out everything by selecting the particular mesh going to edit buttons and clicking on set smooth)

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Changing the Iris Color===
To change the iris color you can either edit the iris image external from blender or you can modify the RGB values of the image when imported into Blender.

For rigging an eyeball, (making it stay in one place while turning to look at something) and other eyeball stuff, you can visit this site.  This tutorial assumes you already have the eyeball made above or one of your own.  [http://rjnlk94.googlepages.com/eyeballtutorial Click.] 5jun2009, the PDF shows no rigging, only creating an eyeball. (May 10th 2011, the site no longer exists.)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Genericdave. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Genericdave~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:13, 17 March 2015 (UTC)
&lt;!-- SUL finalisation notification --&gt;

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">The StrComp function and Option Compare Text do the same job.  As stated correctly they use a lexicographic comparison of text.  But there are two options for StrComp, these being:

0 = vbBinaryCompare - Perform a binary comparison 
1 = vbTextCompare - Perform a textual comparison 

The vbTextCompare and Option Compare Text options are indentical.  In English texts this comparison probably doesn't matter and indeed could be used for a case insensitive match.  But in other languages, say for example Norwegian it does matter and double characters such as 'ae' may be treated differently.

If in doubt, use the relational operators as these do a direct comparison.  Only use StrComp if you're interested in sorting in languages other than English. {{unsigned|62.49.20.95|15 October 2005‎}}

:Please include this in the page at the relevant place.  Also it would be helpful to everyone if you were to create an account and sign your contributions with four tilde characters like this &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Then each entry in the talk page gets the name (or pseudonym) and date and time.  Lastly, welcome to Visual Basic Classic.   --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:41, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Begins ''&quot;tada examples of Paleolithic (Old Stone Age)&quot;'' I assume that's meant to be ''&quot;Today examples...&quot;'' but I'm not confident enough to correct it. Anyone know? --[[User:Bodnotbod|Bodnotbod]] 11:38, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

Tada makes no sense. I changed the word back to &quot;famous&quot;. Also I recreated the subheadings under Paleolithic Art.

==Picture is huge ==
How did the picture get so big? I looked at it and it seems to have been done correctly.

For the love of god, fix it.

== Plagiarism ==

The following paragraphs were removed because they are claimed to be plagiarism. See [http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2005/10/can_we_write_gr.html] for the claim.

Paleolithic painters drew their images using chunks of red and yellow ocher. For painting, they ground these same ochers into powders they mixed with water before applying. Large flat stones served as palettes. The painters made brushes from reeds, bristles, or twigs, and may have used a blowpipe of reeds or hollow bones to spray pigments on out-of-reach surfaces. To illuminate their work, the painters used stone lamps filled with marrow or fat, perhaps with a wick of moss.

Perhaps the best-known Paleolithic cave is that at Lascaux, near Montignac, France. Many of the animals were created by outline alone, but others are represented using colored silhouettes. On the walls of the Lascaux cave one sees, side by side, the two basic approaches to drawing and painting found repreatedly in the history of art. Although most of the animals share a common ground line, some seem to float above the viewer's head. The painting has no setting, no background, no indication of place. The Paleolithic painter was concerned solely with representing the animals, not with locating them in a specific place.

Another feature of the Lascaux paintings deserves attention. The bulls there show a convention of representing horns that has been called twisted perspective, because the viewer sees the heads in profile but the horns from the front. Thus, the painter's approach is not strictly or consistently optical. Rather, the approach is descriptive of the fact that cattle have two horns. Two horns are part of the concept &quot;bull.&quot; In strict optical-perspective profile, only one horn would be visible, but to paint the animal in that way would, as it were, amount to an incomplete definition of it.

==Venus vs Woman==

Venus denotes the Roman goddess. This term makes the Woman figure that has appeared in so many other cultures appear roman centric. I recommend having it changed.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cibu. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cibu~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Look at a recently uploaded file - f.e. [[:Image:BasicFlowDiagram.png]], it's a good example. You can click ''edit'' and see how the licence tag is placed in image description. You just put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; as it is.

When it comes to listing of images - no, your images must be available to anyone, for any purpose, including commercial. Wikibooks is open content project - we cannoc accept any restrictions to our materials. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 00:07, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Henrik. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Henrik~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book deals with the subject of the law as it relates to the Internet in general and to various topics in particular.  Most of the material will be oriented toward United States law as that is where most of the legal issues become raised, but where material is from other countries it will be identified.

Note that the protections granted by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States are either unavailable or much weaker in other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Defamation''' is the making of a false statement about another which damages their reputation.  The rules that apply in general to written publications and letters people have written would apply to material published on the Internet.

Note: For the purposes of this article, &quot;John Johnson&quot; is a fictional person used for the example here, and does not refer to anyone with the same name.  (This is so that I don't get sued for libeling someone who just happens to have that name!)

Defamation can either be a statement which is spoken, in which case, it is ''slander''.  If the defamatory statement is in writing, it is ''libel''.  It has been held in one case that a spoken statement read from a writing also constituted libel.

Since almost all material on the Internet is written, most defamation claims regarding the Internet would constitute libel.  A sound recording such as material in a podcast would probably constitute slander.

In order for an allegedly defamatory statement to be actionable at law, certain conditions must apply.

* The statement must be untrue.  Under U.S. law, a truthful statement is an absolute defense to a charge of defamation.  In the U.K., it is possible for certain truthful statements to still constitute libel.
* The statement must not be privileged.  If one repeats material from a police report, a court proceeding, or other public document, the statement, even if untrue, is priveleged and is not actionable.  Also, repeating a statement made by the subject of the statement is also priveleged, e.g. if John says in a flippant comment that he is a child molester (&quot;I'm a child molester, yeah, right.&quot;), someone repeating that statement cannot be sued by John for saying it, since John himself is the source of the statement.  Also, certain laws specifically exclude liability for third-party comments posted on the Internet.
* The statement must be in the nature of a fact, and not an opinion.  If you say that someone is &quot;the worst writer in the world&quot; or is &quot;a worthless human being,&quot; these are subjective statements of opinion and are not actionable. Publically calling someone a child molester, a homosexual, a bastard, or any other statement which can be proven, ''if the statement is false'', is actionable as defamation.
* The statement must be ''published''.  This means that someone other than the subject has to see the statement (and other than by the subject showing it to others.)  If you send a private e-mail to someone saying that they have AIDS, that is not actionable because it was not published.  If you send the e-mail to a mailing list or post it to a USENET news group, it is actionable if it is false.
* The statement must in some way damage their reputation.  A statement about someone that would tend to make people not want to associate with them (&quot;Did you hear that John Johnson is a child molester&quot;) , accuses them of a crime (&quot;I heard that John Johnson robbed a bank and killed a cop.&quot;), or accuses them of having a &quot;loathsome disease&quot; (&quot;Did you know John Johnson has AIDS?&quot;) are examples of defamatory statements.  Calling someone a visitor from Mars or a space alien would not be defamatory since it does not in some way damage their reputation.
* The person must be a private individual, or if a &quot;public figure,&quot; the statement must either be made where the party who made it knew or should have known it was false (&quot;Reckless disregard for the truth&quot;), or was made with malice. Calling your next-door neighbor a crook is probably actionable; calling a politician who suddenly has a lot of money after being elected a crook is probably not.
* The statement must be capable of being believed. For example, there was a famous case in which a magazine ran a clearly indicated parody advertisement, that claimed a well-known minister had sex with his mother in an outhouse.  While the statement was false and would normally be defamatory, because it was admitted that no one could seriously believe the statement was true, it did not constitute libel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Trademark''' is a word, phrase, ''device'', color or sound that specifically identifies certain goods or services to the exclusion of all others of the same or similar goods or services identified by the trademark. The ''Trademark Act of 1946  (the “Lanham Act”) (15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1127)'' was enacted to ensure that consumers are able to rely on marks in exercising their preferences, by prohibiting competitors from using marks in a manner that confuses consumers about the source of a product or service. A trademark could be applied to 
*a brand of software used on or sold over the Internet, such as Apache for the web server or Linux for the operating system.
*a particular service available over the Internet, such as the Yahoo web portal, the eBay resale service, or the Amazon book store.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{BookbindingTOC}}

It's easy to repair paperback books using Japanese bookbinding techniques. Just punch four holes through the book near the spine and lash it together with needle and thread. You can make sketch books, scrapbooks or blank books this way, too. To make smaller books, fold several sheets of paper paper carefully into halves or quarters, clamp the stack together and punch and bind it.  Optionally, you can then slit the pages apart with a sharp knife afterwards, being careful not to cut the binding threads.

To rebind a paperback you will need:
# thin wire brads and a small hammer, or an [[Bookbinding/Awl|awl]] 
# heavy [[Bookbinding/Thread|thread]], six times as long as the book 's height
# needle
# pencil
# ruler

[[w:Binder clip|Binder clip]]s are useful, too. 

For a scrapbook or blank book, cut covers from card stock or a [[Bookbinding/Re-used materials|file folder]].

Here's what you do:

[[Image:Hole spacing for Japanese binding.PNG]] 1. Using a ruler, draw a line from top to bottom of the front cover, about 1/4&quot;from the spine. Make two marks on this line, one 1/4' down from the top of the book, the other 1/4&quot; up from the bottom. Now divide the distance between these marks into thirds and mark the two middle points.

2. Even up the pages and clamp the book together with binder clips, or weight down the front edge to keep the pages from moving. Protect your work surface with a piece of scrap wood or an old phone book as you punch a hole at each of the marked points using the awl or wire brads.

Making these holes should not damage the text in the book. Most paperback books have an inner margin of 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot;, leaving plenty of room for rebinding.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-Anchoring the thread.PNG]]
3. Thread the needle and tie the ends together with an overhand knot. Open the book a few pages and, next to the lower middle hole, push the needle through about twenty pages. Pull the thread through until the knot is snug against the pages. Go back out to the front cover by pushing the needle up through the awl hole. This step anchors the thread.

4. Now sew the rest of the book as shown in the accompanying illustrations. Pull the thread tight each time you go through a hole.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 1.PNG]]
Go around the back and back up through the starting hole, then down through the other middle hole. Pull the thread tight after going through each hole.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 2.PNG]]
Around the back again, then up through the top hole.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 3.PNG]]
Around the back, then...

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 4.PNG]]
...around the top of the spine and up through the top hole again. Keep going, down through one middle hole, back up through the next, and down through the bottom hole. Keep the thread tight.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 5.PNG]]
Around the back again and...

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 6.PNG]]
...around the bottom of the spine and back through the bottom hole. Go up through the starting hole again.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 7.PNG]]
To finish, tie off the thread so the binding won't come loose. Do this by slipping the needle under two of the top threads coming out of starting hole and back through the loop to form a tight knot.

[[Image:Sewing a Japanese book-figure 8.PNG]]
Run the needle back down through the starting hole and cut the leftover thread flush with the back of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Environment Variables===
Every program inherits &quot;environment variables&quot; from the program that started it. This means that each program has the same environment variables as the program that started it. The environment of a program can change, in which case other programs later started by that program also have a changed environment.

The environment variable called '''SHELL''' contains the name of the default shell. (You might be running some other shell, but the default shell is always in &quot;SHELL&quot;.) The &quot;SHELL&quot; environment variable is set during login and inherited by the shell. When we started the &quot;printenv&quot; program, it inherited the entire environment, including &quot;SHELL&quot;, and showed &quot;SHELL&quot; to us.

Using '''printenv''' with no arguments gives the entire environment:
 $ '''printenv'''
 ...
 SHELL=/bin/bash
 ...

See [[../../Environment Variables/]] to learn about specific variables.

=== Process limits ===

Each process has limits on the following.

Limits are inherited from the parent process. The normal way to set limits is to change the limits of some shell, and then start the program from that shell. Each shell provides a different way to set limits: Bourne shell uses the '''ulimit''' command while C shell uses '''limit'''.


The following is the list of available limits, given with their ''C shell name'' (&quot;Bourne shell option&quot;). We need the ''name'' (&quot;option&quot;) to show or change the limit in the ''C'' (&quot;Bourne&quot;) shell.

 * ''cputime'' (&quot;-t SECONDS&quot;)
 * ''filesize'' (&quot;-f BLOCKS&quot;)
 * ''datasize'' (&quot;-n KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''stacksize'' (&quot;-s KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''coredumpsize'' (&quot;-c BLOCKS&quot;) can also accept &quot;unlimited&quot; instead of BLOCKS
 * ''memoryuse'' (&quot;-m KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''memorylocked'' (&quot;-l KILOBYTES&quot;)
 * ''maxproc'' (&quot;-p COUNT&quot;)
 * ''openfiles'' (&quot;-n COUNT&quot;)

{{TODO|todonote=Explain how to use &quot;limit&quot; or &quot;ulimit -S&quot; to set limits. Explain the danger of reducing hard limits. Explain what these limits do or refer to another chapter of this book. For example, core dump size might be covered in a chapter on crashing. }}

''Scenario: A program crashes with a message about &quot;resource temporarily unavailable&quot; or &quot;too many open files&quot;.''


Raise the limits in the shell from which you start the program. For example, to allow 512 open files per process:

 ''Bourne shell''
 $ '''ulimit -Sn 512'''

 ''C shell''
 $ '''limit openfiles 512'''

=== Shell Parameters ===
The shell's  environment can be accessed through its parameters. There are three types of parameter:

* named parameters
* positional parameters
* special parameters

Named parameters are known as environment variables. Some of these variables are
initialised when the user logs in and which the shell uses to determines its
behavior. The shell also maintains certain variables throughout the login session,
some of which are defined by the shell and are given special meaning, while
others can be user defined.

Positional parameters enable reference to arguments supplied to shell scripts.
The shell communicates process information through special parameters. Special
parameters can be accessed by the user, but unlike named and positional parameters,
they can only be set by the shell itself.

Environment variables are named parameters. Variables are assigned using the
command line statement in the form ''name=value''. Variable names
are  alphanumeric strings, they can contain numeric characters or underscores but
must begin with an alphabetic character. Four examples are presented below:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ n=2 
$ n2=4
$ N=3
$ MYNAME=alan 
$ greeting=&quot;hello world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that Unix is case sensitive, so the variable &quot;name&quot; is not the same
as &quot;Name&quot;. A variable can be expanded (evaluated) by preceding the variable
name with a $, for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $greeting
hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

Variables can be concatenated:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ day=21 month=01 year=2006
$ echo $day$month$year
21012006
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, there can be problem with concatenating literals with variables, using
variables for the day and month but hard-coding the year gives
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $day$month2006
05
&lt;/pre&gt;
The problem is that the shell cannot distinguish between the variable name 
''month'' and the literal value 2006. It therefore tries to expand a variable 
with the variable name ''month2006'', which is not set. 
This can be rectified by surrounding the variables names with braces {}, 
for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${day}${month}2006
05112006
&lt;/pre&gt;

Although the braces are not always necessary it is good practice to use
them when evaluating variables.

=== Quoting ===
Consider the following example, where the variable expansion phrase is enclosed
in double quotes:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo &quot;echo $greeting&quot;, displays $greeting
echo hello world, displays hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

Variables enclosed in double quotes are still expanded by the shell. To prevent
expansion, variables should be enclosed in single quotes. To display the string
&quot;echo $greeting&quot; verbatim, use the statement:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ’echo $greeting’, displays $greeting
echo $greeting, displays hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== More Parameter Expansion ===

The shell supports quite sophisticated parameter expansion. The construct
&lt;tt&gt;NAME-literal&lt;/tt&gt; expands to the value of the parameter if it is set, otherwise
it expands to literal value. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${OPSYS-unix}    
unix
&lt;/pre&gt;

The variable ''OPSYS'' has not been assigned a value so the result of the command is to
echo the string &quot;unix&quot; to the screen. If the variable is assigned a value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ OPSYS=Linux
$ echo ${OPSYS-unix}
Linux
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the variable is set to NULL, a blank link is displayed rather than the literal value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ OPSYS=&quot;&quot;        
$ echo ${OPSYS-unix}  
(blank line)
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, if we use ''name:-literal'', the variable evaluates to the
literal rather than its NULL value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${OPSYS:-unix}
unix
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the construct ''name=literal'' the parameter is assigned the value of the
literal if it has not been set. Suppose that the variable DAY has not been
previously set:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $DAY
(blank line)
&lt;/pre&gt;

then the command line below will assign the string &quot;tuesday&quot; to the variable ''DAY'' 
and echo it to screen:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DAY=tuesday}
tuesday
&lt;/pre&gt;

The variable ''DAY'' has now been set, so if the command line is repeated 
with a different literal value its value remains unchanged

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DAY=wednesday}
tuesday
&lt;/pre&gt;

If ''DAY'' is assigned a NULL value, the following parameter expansion results
in a NULL value being returned:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ DAY=&quot;&quot;
$ echo ${DAY=tuesday}
(blank line)
&lt;/pre&gt;

An associated expansion construct is ''name-value'', which only returns the literal
if the parameter is unassigned, it returns the assigned value even if the value is
NULL.

Using the expansion construct ''name:=literal'' the parameter is assigned the value of
the literal if it has not been set. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $DISTRO               # DISTRO not assigned
echo ${DISTRO:=ubuntu}
ubuntu
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, the literal is assigned if the parameter is NULL, the expansion is therefore:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ DISTRO=&quot;&quot;
$ echo ${DISTO:=ubuntu}
ubuntu
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the parameter is set to a non-NULL value then the literal is not assigned:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DISTRO:=debian}
ubuntu
&lt;/pre&gt;

The expansion construct ''name=value'' is similar to ''name:=value'', 
however the literal is only assigned if the parameter was formerly 
unassigned. The literal is not assigned if the parameter value is NULL.
Using the ''name:?messagestring'' construct, an error message can be displayed if
parameter is unset or NULL:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DISTVER:?distribution version unknown}
-bash: DISTVER: distribution version unknown
$ DISTVER=&quot;&quot;
$ echo ${DISTVER:?distribution version unknown}
-bash: DISTVER: distribution version unknown
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ''error'' message is not displayed if the parameter is assigned a non-NULL
value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ DISTVER=&quot;hoary hedgehog&quot;
$ echo ${DISTVER:?distribution version not set}
hoary hedgehog
&lt;/pre&gt;

Likewise, there is an associated construct ''name?messagestring'' which 
returns the message string only if the parameter is unset.
Parameters can be expanded to substrings of their value. The expansion constructs
''name%pattern'' and ''name%%pattern'' expand to the largest and smallest substrings
to the left of the pattern respectively. For example, set the variable ''TIME'':

&lt;pre&gt;
$ TIME=10:29:39
&lt;/pre&gt;

The command line below displays only the hour value:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the hours is ${TIME%%:*}
the hours is 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

whereas the following the command line display the hours and minutes
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the hour and minutes are ${TIME%:*}
the hour and minutes are 10:29
&lt;/pre&gt;
The constructs ''name#pattern'' and ''name##pattern'' expand to the 
largest and smallest substring to the right of the pattern respectively. 
So the command line below expands to the seconds:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the seconds are ${TIME##*:}
the seconds are 39
&lt;/pre&gt;

The minutes and seconds can be extracted with:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo the minutes and seconds are ${TIME#*:}
the minutes and seconds are 29:39
&lt;/pre&gt;

The length of a string can be evaluated with the ''#name'' construct. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${#TIME}
8
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Arrays ===
Variables can be one-dimensional arrays and are referenced in the form name[index].
Arrays can be assigned using the ''name=(value1 value2 ... )'' construct, 
so for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
DATE=($(date))
&lt;/pre&gt;

''$(command)'' expands to the result of ''command'' on the command line.
So ''DATE'' is assigned output of the command '''date''', where each space separated
string is assigned to an element in the array. So if we only want the year, then we
expand the sixth element of the array:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${DATE[5]}
2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can change, say the time information with the assignment:
&lt;pre&gt;
DATE[3]=19:16:00
$ echo ${DATE[*]}
Wed May 17 19:16:00 NZST 2006
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we need to count the number or assigned array elements, then we use the 
expression:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${#DATE[*]}
6
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Positional Parameters ===
Positional parameters provide a means of accessing arguments to shell scripts.
They are referenced by the numbers 1,2,3,... etc., where the numbers reflect the
order in which the arguments appeared on the command line (from left to right).
They cannot be assigned in the same way as named parameters, that is you cannot
do this: ''1=hello''. Positional parameters are assigned when a shell script is 
invoked with command line arguments. They can, however, be assigned with the set
command:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ set $(uname -rmv)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This causes the space separated strings from the output of ''uname -rmv'' to be 
assigned to the positional parameters. The statement below shows the values of all
positional parameters that were assigned:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${*}
2.6.14.4 #1 SMP Thu Dec 22 01:04:35 NZDT 2005 x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;

And this statement gives the number of assigned positional parameters 
(equivalent to argc in C and C++):
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $#
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we specifically want the kernel version then we expand positional parameter 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $1
2.6.14.4
&lt;/pre&gt;
Double digit positional parameters need to be enclosed in braces. So 
if we want the architecture of the machine, we cannot do this:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $10
2.6.14.40
&lt;/pre&gt;
The expression above is expanded to positional parameter 1 followed by a literal 0.
The correct way is:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${10}
x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, positional parameter 0 is set to the name of the current process 
(equivalent to argv[0], which in this case should be the name of the shell 
command itself:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $0
-bash
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Special Parameters ===

Special parameters can be accessed by the user but can only be assigned (directly)
by the shell - typically in response to some event. We have already encountered the
parameters * and # which are set when a command is invoked with arguments (or
the set command is used).

The ? parameter expands to the return code of the process that last exited. If we
enclose a command line statement in brackets it is executed in a subshell. The
command line below forks a new shell and immediately issues exit. The argument
following exit is the value of the subshell’s return code (255 in this case):

&lt;pre&gt;
$ (exit 255)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The return code of the child process can be accessed by the parent by the expansion
of ?. If a process terminated normally then the return code is likely to be zero. If
however, the process terminated due to some error condition, it is useful if process
sets a non-zero return code so that the parent can determine the reason for the
termination:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $?
255
&lt;/pre&gt;

The process ID of the shell is stored in $. The ps command shows that the process
ID of my shell is 10005, which is what is given by the expansion of $:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ ps | grep bash
10005 pts/77            00:00:00 bash
$ echo $$
10005
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ! parameter evaluates to the process ID of the last background process. To
demonstrate, the statement below invokes the sleep command (which sleeps for 60
seconds) in the background:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ sleep 60 &amp;
[1] 24835
&lt;/pre&gt;

The process ID of the background process is displayed on the screen (in this case
24835). Expansion of the ! parameter confirms this:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo $!
24835
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Exporting Parameters ===
Processes do not inherit environment variables from their parent unless the 
variables are exported. The command line below displays the process ID of 
the current process followed by the value of greeting (which was assigned 
earlier):

&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo ${greeting?parameter not set}
hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we start a new shell and issue the command again we see that greeting is not set
in the child process:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ bash
$ echo ${greeting?parameter not set}
bash: greeting: parameter not set
&lt;/pre&gt;
Terminate the current shell process and return to the parent, then export greeting:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ exit
$ export greeting
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can confirm that a variable has the export attribute set by typing:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ export | grep greeting
declare -x greeting=&quot;hello world&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now start a new shell again and evaluate greeting:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ bash
$ echo ${greeting?parameter not set}
hello world
&lt;/pre&gt;
The new shell has inherited the variable greeting and can evaluate it. 
A variable retains its export attribute (until the shell is terminated) even 
if it is reassigned, but it can be removed using the typeset command:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ typeset +x greeting
$ export | grep greeting     # yields no result
&lt;/pre&gt;
In Bash (and Kornshell, but not Bourne shell), a variable can be assigned and 
exported in one command line statement:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ export greeting=&quot;hi there&quot;
$ export | grep greeting
declare -x greeting=&quot;hi there&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Read on to learn about simple CELX scripting...

If you have comments or questions, please put them on the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/Q&amp;A|Celx Questions and Answers]] page.

==Introduction==
This is a tutorial on simple CELX scripting. It is based on the philosophy that the best way to learn is by example, so there are lots of examples. Each example is usually a small step beyond the previous one, but understanding it may depend on ''any'' previous example, so make sure you understand each example completely before you go on to the next.

==Getting Started==
To get started, you should create a script file for testing purposes. You could call it &quot;test.celx&quot; or something similar. Be sure it has the &quot;.celx&quot; file type suffix so it will be recognized as a Celestia CELX script file. Then you should be able to just double-click on the file icon to cause Celestia to run the script. This is a lot faster than running the script from the Celestia menus. You can keep both Celestia and your text editor running; when you're ready to test your script just save your changes and double-click the file icon. The Celestia window should pop to the front and run your script. After you've observed the result you can return to the editor window to make further changes in the script. And don't overlook the fact that you can cut and paste code directly from the tutorial examples!

==Starting Simple==
Here's a simple CELX script:

&lt;code&gt;celestia:flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;/code&gt;

When you run this script, the message &quot;Hello, Universe!&quot; will briefly appear in the lower left corner of the Celestia window. The script instructions here are very simple. First, we asked the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot; to display the message  &quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;. Then we asked the script to wait for 2 seconds (so we'd have time to see the message).

The format of our request to the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot; is basic to Lua. First we wrote the name of the object, in this case, &quot;celestia&quot;. Then we wrote a colon (:) to indicate that we were requesting the object to perform a function. Then we wrote the name of the function we want the object to perform, in this case, &quot;flash&quot;. Finally, we wrote the parameters to the function, in this case the string &quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;, enclosed in parentheses. (Note that we didn't use quotes around the name of the object or the function, just the parameter.) Other requests to objects to perform a function have a similar format.

Here's another example:

&lt;code&gt;
celestia:flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;br&gt;
celestia:flash(&quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

In this example we've made two requests to the object named &quot;celestia&quot;. Both requests asked the object to perform the same function (the one named &quot;flash&quot;), but we specified different message strings as the parameter to the function in each, causing the object to evaluate the function differently in each case, displaying a different message.

==A Simple Function==
Now let's write our own function:
&lt;tt&gt;
 function flash(message)
    celestia:flash(message)
    wait(2.0)
 end
 
 flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)
 flash(&quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example we defined our own &quot;flash&quot; function, to include the 2 second wait. Then we asked  the script to perform our new function twice, using a different string each time.

Our new function is named &quot;flash&quot;, but it's different from the function of that name which belongs to the object named &quot;celestia&quot;. Instead, the new function belongs to our script. When we ask the script to perform our &quot;flash&quot; function, we don't need to write the name of an object or a colon (:). We just write the name of the function, followed by the parameter enclosed in parentheses.

But note that when we defined our new function, we ''did'' use the object name and colon, because there we ''do'' want to ask the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot;.

The format of a function definition is another Lua basic. First we write the keyword &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt;. Then we write the name of the function, in this case &quot;flash&quot;. Then we write the name of the parameter, enclosed in parentheses. In this case, the parameter is named &quot;message&quot;.  Then we write the sequence of instructions that the script will follow to perform the function. Finally, at the end of the function, we write the keyword &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt;. (Note that we didn't use quotes around the name of the function or its parameter. We only need quotes for literal strings, not for names.)

In this case, the instructions needed to perform our function are to ask the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;flash&quot; using our function's parameter named &quot;message&quot; as the parameter to the object's function. Then we asked the script to wait for 2 seconds.

Note that first we ''defined'' our function, then we ''called'' it (twice). (When we say &quot;called&quot;, we mean that we asked the script to perform the function.)  When we ''defined'' the function, we named its parameter &quot;message&quot;. And we referred to that name in the instructions we used to specify how the function will be performed. Then each time we ''called'' the function, we specified a particular string to be the &quot;message&quot; which the script used when performing  the function.

But you can also uses names rather  than actual strings in a function call, as in the following example
&lt;tt&gt;
 function flash(message)
    celestia:flash(message)
    wait(2.0)
 end
 
 flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)
 farewell = &quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;
 flash( farewell)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example, we first gave the name &quot;farewell&quot; to the string &quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;. Then we asked the script to perform our &quot;flash&quot; function using that name, rather than the string itself.
The syntax of the instruction by which we gave the name to the string is another Lua basic. It consists of the name, in this case &quot;farewell&quot;,  followed by an equals sign (=) to indicate that we're assigning the name to what follows, followed by the actual string. The association of a name with a value in this way is called a variable assignment. The reason it's called a variable is that we can later assign the same name to a different value if we choose to. We can also assign a different name to the value. In that case, the value has more than one name.
(The parameter name in our function definition is not a variable, strictly speaking, but works very much like one.)

By the way, there's another, slightly different format for function definitions, which we'll use in the next example:
&lt;tt&gt;
 flash =  function (message)
              celestia:flash(message)
              wait(2.0)
             end
 
 flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)
 farewell = &quot;Goodbye, Universe!&quot;
 flash( farewell)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In the format we've used in this example, the name of  the function doesn't come after the &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. Instead it comes first, followed by an equals sign (=). Next comes the &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, followed directly by parameter enclosed in parentheses. Then comes the sequence of instructions that define  the function, ending with the &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. The only difference from the way we defined  the function previously is the position of the function name, and the addition of the equals sign.

If this new format for a  function definition looks a lot like a variable assignment, it's no coincidence: that's exactly what it is. We're simply giving a name to a function, just the way we gave a name to a string in the previous example. We will return to the very important implications of this fact later on. Note that it doesn't matter which format you use. Their meaning is identical. 

From this point on, for the sake of brevity, our examples will assume that we've already defined our flash function as in one of the previous examples.

==More Examples==
Now let's try using another function provided by the object named &quot;celestia&quot;:
&lt;tt&gt;
 time = celestia:gettime()
 flash(time)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example, we asked the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;gettime&quot;, and we gave the name &quot;time&quot; to the result (a number) that the object returned to us. Then we asked script to perform our &quot;flash&quot; function, using the number named &quot;time&quot; as the &quot;message&quot; parameter.

No parameters were needed for the object named &quot;celestia&quot; to perform its function named &quot;gettime&quot;, so the parentheses following the function name are empty.

The syntax of the instruction by which we gave the name to the result of this function request is another Lua basic. It consists of the name, in this case &quot;time&quot;,  followed by an equals sign (=) to indicate that we're assigning the name to what follows, followed by the request to the object to perform the function (and return its result).

When you run this script, you'll see a large number briefly displayed. This number is the current time setting in Celestia, expressed as a Julian date. (it's the number of days since the beginning of the Julian epoch).

In the next example, we'll make this clear:
&lt;tt&gt;
 time = celestia:gettime()
 timeMessage = &quot;The current time is &quot; .. time .. &quot; (Julian date).&quot;
 flash(timeMessage)
&lt;/tt&gt;

==More To Come...==
'''WARNING''': Construction area ahead! Proceed at your own risk! 
----
In the next example, we'll convert this to a more recognizable form:

Fortunately, the &lt;tt&gt;celestia&lt;/tt&gt; object has a function to help us do that:
&lt;tt&gt;
 jdate = celestia:gettime()
 flash(jdate)
 date = celestia:fromjulianday(jdate)
 flash(date.year)
&lt;/tt&gt;

In this example, we asked the &lt;tt&gt;celestia&lt;/tt&gt; object to give us the time, then asked it to give us the result of converting that Julian date to a calendar date, and finally asked the script to use our &quot;flash function&quot; to display the part of the date that indicates the year.

To display the full date, we'll need to join the parts of the date for the year, month and day: 
&lt;tt&gt;
 jdate = celestia:gettime()
 flash(jdate)
 date = celestia:fromjulianday(jdate)
 dateString = date.year..&quot;/&quot;..date.month..&quot;/&quot;..date.day
 flash(dateString)
&lt;/tt&gt;
The following additional examples await explanation. In the meantime, you're  invited to see if you can figure them out on your own!
&lt;tt&gt;
  saturn = celestia:find(&quot;Saturn&quot;) -- finds object named Saturn
  radius = saturn:radius() -- gets radius of Saturn
  flash(&quot;The radius of Saturn is &quot;..radius..&quot; km.&quot;)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  flashRadius = function (bodyName)
                           body = celestia:find(bodyName) -- finds object 
                           radius = body:radius() -- gets radius
                           flash(&quot;The radius of &quot; .. body:name() .. &quot; is &quot; .. radius .. &quot; km.&quot;)
                        end
       
  flashRadius(&quot;Jupiter&quot;)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  jupiter = &quot;Jupiter&quot;
  flashRadius(jupiter)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  reallyBigPlanet = &quot;Jupiter&quot;
  flashRadius(reallyBigPlanet)
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  selectedPlanet = celestia:getselection() -- gets the planet currently selected by the user
  flashRadius(selectedPlanet:name())
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  flashRadius = function (body)
                          if type(body) == &quot;string&quot; then
                              body = celestia:find(body) -- finds object 
                          end
                          radius = body:radius() -- gets radius
                          flash(&quot;The radius of &quot; .. body:name() .. &quot; is &quot; .. radius .. &quot; km.&quot;)
                        end
  selectedPlanet = celestia:getselection()
  flashRadius(selectedPlanet)
&lt;/tt&gt;
In this example, we've defined a function to flash a message reporting the radius of a specified planet. Then we called the function twice, to display the radius of two different planets. This should all look familiar to you from previous examples. (In future examples, you should assume our flashRadius function is already defined.) In the next example, we'll do the same thing just a bit differently:
&lt;tt&gt;
  planetList = { &quot;Uranus&quot;, &quot;Neptune&quot; }
  flashRadius(planetList[1])
  flashRadius(planetList[2])
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  planetList = { &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot; }
  for index = 1,3 do
     flashRadius(planetList[index])
  end
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
  planetList = { &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;,  &quot;Venus&quot;,  &quot;Mercury&quot; }
  for index,name in ipairs(planetList) do
     flashRadius(name)
  end
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
 selectedObject = celestia:getselection()
 flashRadius(selectedObject:name())
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
 cassini = celestia:find(&quot;Cassini&quot;) -- finds object named Cassini
 saturn = celestia:find(&quot;Saturn&quot;) -- finds object named Saturn
 cassiniPosition = cassini:getposition() -- gets position of Cassini
 saturnPosition = saturn:getposition() -- gets position of Saturn
 distance = cassiniPosition:distanceto(saturnPosition) -- gets distance from  position of Cassini to that of Saturn
 distance = distance-saturn:radius() -- adjusts for distance to surface
 flash(&quot;Current distance from Cassini to Saturn's surface is &quot;..distance)
&lt;/tt&gt;
This one is a little more fun:
&lt;tt&gt;
 -- tour the moons of Saturn
  obs = celestia:getobserver()
  planet = celestia:find(&quot;Saturn&quot;)
  obs:goto(planet)
  wait(5)
  flash(&quot;Welcome to &quot;..planet:name())
  moons = planet:getchildren()
  for index,body in ipairs(moons) do
     if body:type() == &quot;moon&quot; then
         obs:follow(body)
         obs:goto(body)
         wait(5)
         flash(&quot;Welcome to &quot;..body:name())
         wait(1)
     end
   end 
&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
 -- tour the stars at random
 obs = celestia:getobserver() 
 stars = celestia:getstarcount() 
 for i = 1,stars do 
    j = math.random(stars) 
    obj = celestia:getstar(j) 
    obs:goto(obj,20) 
    while obs:travelling() do wait(0.5) end 
    celestia:flash(&quot;Welcome to &quot;..obj:name(),2) 
  end 
&lt;/tt&gt;

There are many factions within the world of open source, these include the Free Software and the Open Source pundits, the GPL and the BSD supporters, the libertarians and the communists.

These factions all have different reasons for the things they do and the things they don't; for some it is a matter of what is a right and what is practical, for others it is being altruistic to all people and for others it is getting the most out of a situation.

Briefly we shall sum up these groups:

The Free Software Foundation/GNU movement is a socio-political group for whom non-Free software is a social problem and Free Software is the solution.

The Open Source Inititive is a development methodology, to them non-Open Source software is a sub-par solution.

The BSDers (gotta get a better title than that) are a volunteer altruist group who give their work away for everyone.  So everyone can get better.  To them non-BSD code is irrelevant, it can be used and can be learnt from, but does not involved them.

The GPLers (still going to need another name) are volunteers who seek to recieve reimbursement for their contributions.  Getting back what others make of their work.  To them non-GPL code is code which will die, that without the GPL license to protect the code it will not be able to maintain its competitive edge against proprietary software.

Outside of these groups, most people view them singularly as either open source or free software, but within there is a fair bit of bitterness and conflict, because of the different reasons for their actions. They all hold different views on how things should be done. This creates an image of a discordant open source community, when, in fact, it is actually many smaller communities which have only loose ties to one another.

{{TODO|Make notes about how GPL supporters are not all supporters of the FSF.}}

The diferences and approachs between schemme lisp, common lisp and emacs lisp is interesting also. The most interesting is explain the lisp primitives with case of use in the real life. This would be a interesting approach about a book of lisp. 

We can drag and drop a lot of interesting text about introduction, history, etc. from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language.</text>

==Introduction==


{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;All great literature addresses directly or indirectly two questions: ''What kind of world is this?'' and ''How should we live in it?''&quot;|caption=--Christopher Clausen}}



Writing in the humanities includes posing questions dealing with human values.  The ultimate goal in writing in the humanities is to explain/share the human experience, to use writing as a tool to reflect upon life, and to tell how life should, or should not, be lived. &quot;Humanities&quot; as a discipline includes not only literature, but also philosophy, ethics,  performing arts, fine arts, history, aspects of anthropology and cultural studies, foreign languages, linguistics, jurisprudence, political science, and sociology. In a humanities class, you might be asked to attempt the analysis of a poem, a performance or a play, a painting, a film or even a musical performance.

There is often a difference in feel between writing in the Sciences and writing in the Humanities.  Writing in the Sciences is often convergent (meaning oriented toward finding or articulating a specific answer to a specific question).  Writing in the Humanities is often divergent (meaning oriented toward exploration of multiple answers to multiple questions).

== Categories of Humanities Writing ==
Writing in the Humanities falls into three categories: theoretical writing, creative writing, and interpretive and analytical writing.  Term papers and research papers are included in this discipline of writing when their topics pertain to the field of humanities.

=== Theoretical Writing ===
Theoretical writing involves writing on a topic from a theoretical perspective.  In physics, for example, there is a theory on how the galaxy operates called the &quot;string theory.&quot;  A physics paper centered around the string theory would be considered a theoretical paper.

=== Creative Writing ===
Creative writing attempts to achieve, or create, an affect in the minds of the readers.  The intended affect differs depending on the goals of the writer.  The intention may be to expound on the grieving process (catharsis), or to make a person laugh or cry.  The potential results are unlimited.  Creative writing can also be used as an outlet for people to get their thoughts and feelings out and onto paper.  Many people enjoy creative writing but prefer not to share it.  Creative writing can take place in a variety of forms.  Poems, short stories, novels, and even song lyrics are all examples of creative writing.  Viewpoints regarding what exactly is encompassed under the term ''creative writing'' differ.  To some, non-fiction can be considered creative writing because it is done from the author's point of view and may be written in an individual style that engages the reader. In fact, many universities offer courses in &quot;Creative non-fiction.&quot; Others like to separate non-fiction from creative writing because it deals with details that actually took place, even if viewed subjectively.  Regardless, the outlook of the writer is what matters, and whether something is considered creative writing or not is less important than producing a product that you can be proud of.

'''Narrator'''

A narrator is the voice or person who tells the story. One must never assume that a narrator of a story is related to the author in any way. Even if we, as an audience, are aware that the author of the story once had a similar experience to that of the narrator, we cannot make assumptions that there is any truth to the text. When writing or discussing criticism, the intent of the author is also off limits because regardless of the author intent, the value of a text is determined by reader response alone. An example of an author having a similar experience to the narrator of a story she'd written, is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story ''The Yellow Wallpaper.'' Because the author had released statements revealing that she'd had a smilar medical treatment in her life to the narrator of her story, we still cannot assume that the narrator and Gilman are one in the same person.

A '''First-Person''' narrator is when one person narrates the story. Thus, a reader will recognize a first-person narrator because the pro-nouns &quot;I&quot; and &quot;my&quot; will be used. Because the story is narrated by one person, we are limited to the thoughts and observations of that person. There are many reasons that an author may choose to use a first-person narrator, but the reason is mainly to demonstrate the changes within one particular character, and also to build suspense. For example, if an author were to suddenly swith a first-person myself novel to a third-person narrator, the &quot;who-done-it&quot; aspect of the story would be ruined because we would suddenly be able to dive into the minds of multiple characters.

There is also '''Third-person limited''' and '''Third-person omniscient.''' Third-person limited is when the narrator is limited to the thoughts of one particular character, but there is a little more freedom than with a first-person narrator because the narrator can more easily observe the behavior of others. Finally, a third-person omniscient narrator is when the lens of the storyteller is pulled back even further, but we are able to dive into the minds of any and all characters. Therefore, a third-person omniscient narrater is rather God-like in that it enables us to know absolutely anything and everything that is happening in the novel. This may sound like the most enjoyable way to compose, but as stated earlier, there are drawbacks to this kind of narrator in that it may be harder to create an element of surprise for the reader.

'''Literary Periods'''

''Deconstructionism'' is an approach to literature which suggests that literary works do not yield a single, fixed meaning because we can never say what we truly mean in language.

''Early Modern Era'' Period extending from about 1500 to 1800, marked by the advent of colonialism and capitalism.

''Modernism'' Writing and art roughly made in at the start of WWI (1914) through the end of WWII (1945).

''Postmodernism'' is a literary and artistic movement that flourished in the late twentieth century, partly in response to Modernism. A common theme in this kind of work is self-reflexiveness.

&lt;ref&gt;The Bedford Anthology of World Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpretive and Analytical Writing ===

==== Interpretive Writing ==== 

* An interpretation involves the discovery of meaning in a text (or film or painting, etc.) or the production of meaning in the process of reading a text.  Therefore, interpretive writing must address many questions.  It tries to assist the reader in understanding specific events (literary, cultural, or otherwise) rather than just engaging in summary.  For example, a student writing an interpretive paper about a specific book may try to explain the author's attitudes or views on a specific subject matter.  The writer of the paper then uses the evidence found in that book to back up his or her claims.   A poor example of interpretive writing is a book report.  A good example of interpretive writing is a scholarly article about another text.   

Writing might ask questions such as, &quot;Why did these events happen?&quot; or &quot;What was the significance of these events to the author or main character?&quot; as opposed to, &quot;What happened&quot; or &quot;How did these events come about?&quot;  The former questions encourage writers to explore their own thoughts or to delve into the mind of the writer of the text, or even attempt to put himself in the shoes of the protagonist.  The latter is less challenging, as the book or piece of literature will plainly lay this type of information out for the reader.

==== Analytical Writing ====

* Analytical writing examines the components of a text.  Writers of analytical essays or articles consider information, break it apart, and reconstruct it in order to describe the information so another reader can make sense of it.   Writers must make sense of a work before they can begin to describe its constituent parts.

* Analytical writing focuses on the words &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why.&quot; A writer often uses each of these two terms to give proof of their current analogies. By using these strong terms, a reader can feel that the writer is confident in their work and know &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; they should react.  

* Analytical writing happens in four steps.  The ''first'' step is to clearly identify the problem, the question, or the issue.  The ''second'' step is to define the issue.  The ''third'' step is the actual analysis of the topic.  Finally, the ''fourth'' step defines the relationship between the issue and the analysis of that issue.

==== Analyzing and Interpreting Literature ====

* There is a lot of overlap in the processes of analysis and interpretation, especially when writing about literature.  Writing about literature (poems, short stories, plays, etcs) often involves making an argument that can be backed up with specific examples from the text.  When interpreting a poem the writer should expect that they will have to include specific references to the lines, words, or phrases to which they are referring.  A writer analyzing the main character in ''The Great Gatsby'' should include specific references that explain why they have reached a particular conclusion.  

* An essay dealing with literature should not be a summary of the text.  It doesn't always hurt to give a few background examples, but the writer should focus on talking about the portions of the text that emphasize their points, not summarizing the entire piece for the reader.  If the reader isn't familiar with the primary text, they can go back and read it themselves.  The interpreter's job isn't to recap, but to make an argument, and hopefully provide some sort of illumination of the work.

* A piece of literature should always be referred to in the present tense.  

* Take a look at this sample essay on the play ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&lt;center&gt;'''Fairies, Duality, and Conflict'''&lt;/center&gt;

	It’s hard to read A Midsummer Night’s Dream without noticing at least some duality within the play.  While it’s relatively easy to spot in the “lamentable comedy” performed by the mechanicals, there are also more nuanced examples that are introduced in Act 2, Scene 1.  This scene reveals some of the play’s duality, specifically in regards to the fairies, as it continues to build on Act 1’s theme of conflict between lovers.


The start of this scene opens with Puck talking with another fairy.  This is the first appearance of any fairies and it adds a fantasy, or dream-like, element to the play.  The unnamed fairy announces that, “I serve the Fairy Queen, / To dew her orb upon the green” (2.1.8-9).  This fits the idea that many people have of fairies; they are pleasant folk associated with nature.  Nothing about this fairy is threatening or even mischievous.  This is directly at odds with the character of Puck.  Puck spends his time pretending to be footstools that women can sit on, “Then I slip from her bum, down topples she, / And ‘Tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough” (2.1.53-54).  He “frights the maidens of the villagery” (2.1.35) and does things like, “mislead might wanderers, laughing at their harm?”  (2.1.39).  While the unnamed fairy is out spreading dew upon blades of grass, Puck is out spreading mischief.  The unnamed fairy represents the good within fairy-kind, while Puck represents the potentially threatening.  An examination of Puck’s name adds to this.  According to the unnamed fairy, Puck is also known as Robin Goodfellow (2.1.34); but, he doesn’t go by that name, he goes by Puck.  If Puck were a more good-natured fairy, he might prefer to go by the name Robin Goodfellow.  However, his decision to play a darker role than the other fairies mirrors his decision to go by a less pleasant sounding moniker.  Puck is more of an imp than a fairy.  He has a trickster mentality that isn’t present in the other fairies. 


Puck and the unnamed fairy are representative of two larger factions, which are each headed by a more powerful fairy.  At the beginning of the scene the unnamed fairy says she serves the fairy queen, and Puck later reveals who he serves by saying, “I jest to Oberon and make him smile” (2.1.44).  Later in this scene Oberon will ask Puck to run an errand for him, and the sensitivity of the errand suggests that Oberon wouldn’t trust just anyone with it.  In addition to being Oberon’s jester, Puck is also his confidant.  


Oberon’s entrance into the scene matches the more threatening demeanor that Puck embodies.  Puck notes that, “Oberon is passing fell and wrath, / Because that she as her attendant hath / A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king” (2.1.20-22).  Oberon and all he represents is at odds with Titania and all that she represents.  Oberon and Titania’s conflict is in addition to the other conflicts in the play between couples:  Theseus and Hippolyta and the Lysander/Hermia/Demetrius/Helena quartet.  It’s also fitting that Oberon and Titania are arguing over a human boy.  The human world has created conflict in the fairy world, just as the fairy world will later on intensify the conflict of the human world of the four lovers.

 
Oberon and Titania are shown in this scene as having emotions like any ordinary human.  This reinforces the bond between the two worlds in the play; the world of fantasy and the more concrete world that the humans live in.  Oberon and Titania both have other lovers.  Titania notes that Oberon has been spending time with Phillida and Hippolyta (2.1.66-71), while Oberon counters that Hippolyta has been intimate with Theseus (2.1.76-80).  They argue over infidelity like any humans would in a similar relationship.  The fact that they both appear to have cheated on one another may not entirely add up since Titania appears to represent a kinder, gentler fairy demographic, as opposed to Oberon’s more threatening one.  But Titania says why she cheated.  She calls her infidelities, “the forgeries of jealousy” (2.1.81).  Titania is arguing that she only cheated because Oberon drove her to it.  Perhaps, she needed more attention than Oberon was willing to give.  Perhaps, she was trying to hurt Oberon like he had hurt her.  These are very human reactions and impulses.


Yet, these are not mere humans, but fairies:  not just fairies, but fairy royalty.  Because of this wrinkle, their actions, and their discord, has a marked effect on the world around them.  Once Oberon started cheating on Titania, 
          The winds, piping to us in vain,
          As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea
          Contagious fogs which, falling in the land,
          Hath every pelting river made so proud
          That they have overborne their continents.  (2.1.88-92)
In addition to the floods there are also droughts, famine and a host of other issues (2.1.93-114).  The relationship of these two is clearly the reason for the disturbance in nature.  This is shown when Titania says, “And this same progeny of evils comes / from our debate, from our dissension. / We are their parents and original” (2.1.115-117).  The trouble that has overtaken the natural world is at odds with the preparations concerning the festival that are taking place within Athens.  Much as the forest world is a different place than the stone walls of Athens.  Yet, despite their differences, nature and the 
civilized world will interact.  It’s impossible to keep them completely apart despite their separate natures.


It’s also worth noting how the relationship between Oberon and Titania was prior to their discord, 
          Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
          By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
          Or in the beached margent of the sea,
          To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind.  (2.1.83-86)
They were like two young lovers, who met everywhere and couldn’t get enough of each other before Oberon ruins things.  Titania says to him, “But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport” (2.1.87).  Certainly, many relationships encounter problems after an initial period of bliss; but, it should also be noted that abusive people often appear to be sweet and caring before their true colors show.  Oberon may just be that cruel.  He only wants the Indian boy because Titania has him; perhaps, specifically because Titania loves him.  After all, Oberon wants the boy to be a, “Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild” (2.1.25).  As the fairy king Oberon must have plenty of others whom he could get to fill that type of position.  Titania, on the other hand, genuinely cares for him.  We know this because she, “Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy” (2.1.27).  Oberon can’t quite comprehend why Titania shouldn’t do what he says and he says so, “Why should Titania cross her Oberon?”  (2.1.119).  Because Oberon can’t comprehend why Titania would cross him, he sends Puck to get him a juice that will allow him to force Titania into submission (2.1.169-174).  Oberon’s unwillingness to allow Titania’s free spirit to go unpunished is a perfect example of the cruel and threatening demeanor of his.  The element of fantasy that the fairies add can be dreamlike, but dreams can become nightmares, and Oberon is a darker personality to counter Titania’s light.


This scene also has Demetrius and Helena in it, and provides us great insight into their characters.  Demetrius is brushing off Helena and she says,
          I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
          The more you beat me I will fawn on you.
          Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
          Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
          Unworthy as I am, to follow you.  (2.1.203-207)
This works on a variety of levels.  For one, it brings into the play a darker, more masochistic, idea of love that is at odds with the pure notion of love that the audience may assume that Lysander and Hermia share.  It also reveals Helena as a woman who acts the opposite of Titania.  Titania handles her abusive relationship by seeking love in another’s arms, by spending time with the people who care for her, and by devoting her time to a boy.  She separates herself from her abuser, Oberon, rather than seeking his company.  Hermia seeks the abuse out.  She views any attention, no matter how negative, as positive simply because it’s some sort of attention.  If Demetrius gave her positive attention, perhaps she wouldn’t be happy for long.  Demetrius, on the other hand, tells Helena that looking at her makes him sick (2.1.213).  He talks to her as if he hates her, and it takes a hard-heart to look so cruelly on someone so pathetic.  Oberon happens to witness the exchange between these two and he sends Puck to put Demetrius under the same spell that he wants Titania put under (2.1.259-266).  It’s this part of the scene that sets into motion the rest of the play, as Titania is put under the spell’s effects, and Puck inadvertently finds Lysander instead of Demetrius.


In addition to setting the stage for the action that will come afterward, this scene reveals much about the characters within it.  It introduces the fairies and their duality, and it builds up a darker aspect of the play through the continuation of conflict that acts to counteract some of the lightheartedness of the play.

|caption=Sample Essay}}

Here the writer has chosen to focus on one specific scene in the play, and how it fits their argument about the duality and conflict present within the play.  Notice that throughout the entire essay there are numerous examples from within the text.  Had the author not included these, or had they just summarized everything briefly, the essay wouldn't be as strong as it currently is.  Here the reader can see exactly what lines make the writer think the way they do.  Also, notice that the paper isn't a summary of what happens in the scene.  When the writer gives details about what happens in the scene, it is because these details relate directly to the topic of their paper.

=== Research Papers and Term Papers ===

Term papers have a variety of elements that make them stand out from other papers.  They carry three distinct characteristics.  First, there is a large amount of research that goes into a term paper.  The research contains various findings such as: facts, statistics, interviews, quotes, etc. Researching and gathering data must include understanding that information once it is compiled.  The second characteristic is the amount of preparation it takes in gathering, compiling, analyzing, and sorting through everything in order to create a draft of your data.  Finally, the third characteristic involves knowing the rules that must be followed when writing a specific term paper in the humanities discipline.  These rules will generally be conveyed by your instructor.

Writing the research paper involves a bit of detective work.  While there is much reading to be done on the chosen topic, reading is not the only pathway to gain information.  As a writer in the humanities, you can also conduct interviews, surveys, polls, and observation clinics.  You should research and discover as much information as you can about the given topic so you can form a coherent and valid opinion.

== Elements of the Humanities Paper==

Many styles of documentation are used when writing the humanities paper.  Choosing the style depends on the subject being addressed in the paper and the style your instructor may prefer you use.

When it comes down to actually writing your paper, be sure to include the following elements:  an introduction, a thesis statement, the body of the paper (which should include quotations, and, of course, the citations), and the conclusion.  

=== Introduction ===
Like most papers and essays, an introduction is absolutely necessary when writing in the humanities.  There can be some confusion as to which should come first; the introduction or the thesis statement.  This decision could probably be clarified by asking your instructor.  Many writers include the thesis statement in their introduction.  Generally speaking, however, the introduction usually comes before the thesis statement.

The introduction should grab your reader and make them interested in continuing to read your paper.  Ask a question, say something powerful, or say something controversial.  Be specific, not vague.  Say something interesting, not mundane.  Relay something the reader may not know, not something that is public knowledge.  The idea is to get the reader's attention, and keep it.

A good intro may go something like this: 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Imagine yourself walking out of class feeling refreshed and relaxed because your day is almost done. You race down the stairs and out the doors just to take in the amazing scent of fresh outside air when suddenly you smell something completely wretched. You notice something that resembles a small grey cloud coming out of a fellow student's mouth. Then your throat begins to feel clogged and just when you can't take it any longer, your lungs give in and you feel as if you can no longer breathe. You think to yourself, 'What's happening to me? Am I dying?' No, not exactly. Your lungs and the rest of your body have just been affected by what is commonly known as passive smoking, which is becoming one of the leading causes of death in the United States.&quot;|caption=}}

After the introduction has been written, you can then go into your thesis statement.  Many people regard the thesis statement as a continuation of the introduction, only in the next paragraph.

=== Thesis Statement ===
The thesis statement should come at the beginning of the paper.  It will introduce the reader to the topic you intend to address, and gives them a hint of what to expect in the pages that follow.  Thesis statements should avoid words and phrases such as, &quot;In my opinion...&quot; or &quot;I think that...&quot;  Start your thesis by taking a stand immediately; be firm in your statement, but not pushy.  You'll either be given your topic for your paper or you will choose it yourself.  In either case, after the topic is chosen, write a thesis statement that clearly outlines the argument you intend to address in the paper.  The thesis statement will be the center of your paper.  It should address one main issue.  Throughout the paper, whatever you write will be focused on the thesis statement.  As your paper develops, you may find you will want to, or need to, revise your thesis statement to better outline your paper.  As your paper evolves, so does your thesis.  In other words, when writing your thesis statement, keep your paper in mind, and when writing your paper, keep your thesis statement in mind.  Your paper will defend your thesis, so write your paper accordingly.

For example, if the topic is &quot;Analyzing Mark Twain's 'Huckleberry Finn,'&quot; your thesis statement might address the social implications or meanings behind the characters chosen for the story.  Keeping the thesis statement in mind, you would then write your paper about the characters in the story.  Let's say you are writing a philosophy paper.  Your thesis statement might include two opposing arguments, with the hint that you intend to argue or prove one side of the argument.  Many thesis statements are written in such a way as to try to prove an argument or point of view, but challenge yourself; make your thesis statement a statement of how you plan to ''disprove'' an argument.  Maybe you want to attempt to show your readers why a specific point of view does ''not'' work.

Your thesis statement should address one main issue.  It takes a point of view or an argument, and the paper is the development of this argument.  If your thesis statement is too simple, obvious, or vague, then you need to work on it a little more.  You should try to write it in a way that will catch your reader's attention, making it interesting and thought-provoking.  It should be specific in nature, and address the theme of the entire paper.  The thesis statement may be written to try to convince the reader of a specific issue or point of view.  It may also address an issue to which there is no simple solution or easy answers;  remember, make it thought-provoking.  Many thesis statements ''invite'' the reader to disagree.

Don't be alarmed if you find yourself midway through your paper and wanting to change your thesis statement.  This will happen.  Sometimes a writer will start out thinking they know ''exactly'' the point they want to make in their paper, only to find halfway through that they've taken a slightly different direction.  Don't be afraid to modify your thesis statement.  But a word of caution; if you modify your thesis statement, be sure to double check your paper to ensure that it is supported by the thesis.  If you have changed your thesis statement, it would be wise, even advisable, to have a third party read your paper to be sure that the paper supports the thesis and the revised thesis describes the paper.

=== Body ===
The &quot;body&quot; of your paper contains the &lt;i&gt;evidence, analysis,&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; reasoning&lt;/i&gt; that support your thesis.  Often the topic of the paper is divided into subtopics.  Typically, each subtopic is discussed in a separate paragraph, but there is nothing wrong with continuing a subtopic throughout multiple paragraphs.  It is good practice to begin each paragraph with a &lt;i&gt;topic sentence&lt;/i&gt; that introduces the subject of the new paragraph and helps transition between paragraphs.  A topic sentence will help keep you focused while writing the paragraph, and it will keep your reader focused while reading it.

=== Conclusion ===
The purpose of a conclusion is to &quot;wrap up&quot; the discussion of your paper.  Especially if the paper is a long one, it is a good idea to &quot;re-cap&quot; the main ideas presented in your paper.  If your paper is argumentative, you'd likely want to re-enforce the standpoint introduced in your thesis statement; however, rather than repeating your thesis, offer closing statements that make use of all the information you've presented to support your thesis.  Try to &quot;echo&quot; your thesis so that your reader understands that you have fulfilled the &quot;promise&quot; a thesis statement implies, but give your reader a sense of &lt;i&gt;closure&lt;/i&gt; rather than simply restating everything you said above just ending it.

Here are some strategies for closing your discussion:

''After summing up your main points/thesis you might''
* Comment on the significance of the topic in general:  why should your reader care?
* Look to the future:  Is there more work to be done on the topic?  Are there predictions you can make about your topic?
* Ask something of your reader:  Is there something your reader can do?  Should do?

=== Argumentative Research Papers ===

One of the main things that differentiates a college level research paper from research papers below the college level is they almost always will be argumentative; that is, they will be taking a stance.  The research is then used to back up the argument of the writer, or to put their argument into context.  Students new to college will often attempt to simply provide information that makes the research paper becoming stale and unnecessary.  If all the paper is doing is repackaging old information, why not just go back to the original source?  Papers that just provide information risk unintentional plagiarism.  If none of the information provided contains your own insights, then failing to cite everything means that it is plagiarized.  Yet, most students would be reluctant to cite the entirety of their paper.

=== Plagiarism ===

Plagiarism results from including non-trivial information (ideas, facts, etc) from another source without acknowledging its source.  Plagiarism is one of the most serious offenses that can be committed in academia and it involves varying degrees.  Plagiarism at its most blatant includes  handing in an entire paper that is not one's own; it also includes failing to document one's sources.  When writing a research paper, avoid unintentional plagiarism. Because almost no knowledge other than eye-witness accounts is truly original, be sure to find sources for all non-trivial information. Plagiarism can be grounds for failing a paper or the course as a whole.

== Resources To Use ==

The humanities category offers many good sources from which to gather information.  The Internet is fast becoming an important source of information for humanities writing.  There are many history sites, journalism and news sites, sites focusing on the history of film, sites dedicated to womens' issues, and so on.  More traditional physical resources include dictionaries, encyclopedias, biographies, indexes, abstracts, and periodicals, and our old friend, the library.

As you can see, there are many resources from which to choose when writing your paper.  Start at the most basic level and progress from there.  For example, if you are writing about a specific work of a famous author, the obvious place to begin is with a careful reading of the work in question. Once you are done, try to articulate what you know to be true, what you think is ''probably'' true, and what is open to question: that is, what you might need to find out. It is helpful to actually go through the physical process of writing out two or three key questions that you would like to focus on.

At that point, you may want begin your further researches with a search through an encyclopedia, or do an online search for available resources, including interviews.  After you have found the information you need there, you might then search a through a card catalog in a library for specific books.  You may find that while searching for one specific book you will stumble upon many other useful books on the same subject.  You can then begin to look through book reviews for information on your subject.  Book reviews can be especially informative in that they will often will identify important themes, raise new questions, and broaden your sense of what is at stake in the text.  Next, you may want to try searching for articles in periodicals, and even abstracts of articles, which will provide a summary of the content of the potential article.

'''Waldorf Salad''', created by Oscar Tschirky in 1890 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, New York, in the United States of America.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 large Granny Smith apple
* 1 large Red Delicious apple
* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
* 1/3 cup (80g) of raisins
* 1/3 cup (80g) of chopped walnuts
* 1/3 cup (80g) of chopped celery
* 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Sugar | sugar]]
* 6 large leaves of lettuce
* 10 halved maraschino cherries

== Procedure ==

# Slice the apples into wedges, place in a bowl.
# Pour lemon juice on the apple wedges, and ensure a light coating to prevent browning.
# Plumpen the raisins by placing them in warm water for 5 minutes, drain well.
# Mix celery, raisins and walnuts into the bowl of apple wedges.
# Mix the mayonnaise and sugar together, then pour into the apple mixture, ensure a light coating on all items.
# Chill for at least 30 minutes
# Place three lettuce leaves on a large plate and three on another, place half of the mixture on each set of leaves, sprinkle 5 cherries on each salad.
# Serve

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Though the original salad only used apples, celery and mayonnaise; walnuts mixed in have become an integral part of the modern version of the salad and cherries are only used as a sweet addition to further the contrasts within the salad.

Instead of raisins, try using grapes to create the same sort of taste but more wholly and not as rich.

'''[[w:Conrail|Conrail]]''' (officially the '''Consolidated Rail Corporation''') was a major [[w:railroad|railroad]] in the [[w:Northeast U.S.|Northeast U.S.]] from 1976 to 1999. It was set up by the Federal Government to take over the bankrupt railroads in the Northeast, and eventually became profitable and was split between two competing systems ([[w:CSX Transportation|CSX Transportation]] and the [[w:Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern Railway]]).

==[[w:Regional Rail Reorganization Act|Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973==
Public Law 93-236 signed January 2, 1974
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
;(a)  Findings
The Congress finds and declares that—
#Essential rail service in the midwest and northeast region of the United States is provided by railroads which are today insolvent and attempting to undergo reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act.
#This essential rail service is threatened with cessation or significant curtailment because of the inability of the trustees of such railroads to formulate acceptable plans for reorganization. This rail service is operated over rail properties which were acquired for a public use, but which have been permitted to deteriorate and now require extensive rehabilitation and modernization.
#The public convenience and necessity require adequate and efficient rail service in this region and throughout the Nation to meet the needs of commerce, the national defense, the environment, and the service requirements of passengers, United States mail, shippers, States and their political subdivisions, and consumers.
#Continuation and improvement of essential rail service in this region is also necessary to preserve and maintain adequate national rail services and an efficient national rail transportation system.
#Rail service and rail transportation offer economic and environmental advantages with respect to land use, air pollution, noise levels, energy efficiency and conservation, resource allocation, safety, and cost per ton-mile of movement to such extent that the preservation and maintenance of adequate and efficient rail service is in the national interest.
#These needs cannot be met without substantial action by the Federal Government.
|The rail system in the Northeast was dying. All the major railroads in the region, most notably [[w:Penn Central Transportation|Penn Central Transportation]], had filed for bankruptcy, and it was likely that there would be no fix without the Federal Government playing a major role.
|-
|
;(b)  Purposes
It is therefore declared to be the purpose of Congress in this chapter to provide for—
#the identification of a rail service system in the midwest and northeast region which is adequate to meet the needs and service requirements of this region and of the national rail transportation system;
#the reorganization of railroads in this region into an economically viable system capable of providing adequate and efficient rail service to the region;
#the establishment of the United States Railway Association, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;
#the establishment of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;
#assistance to States and local and regional transportation authorities for continuation of local rail services threatened with cessation; and
#necessary Federal financial assistance at the lowest possible cost to the general tax­payer
|Thus the [[w:United States Railway Association|United States Railway Association]] and Conrail will be established.

Sec. 1101. Congressional findings and declarations

      The Congress finds and declares that - 
        (1) the processes set in motion by the Regional Rail
      Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have failed to
      create a self-sustaining railroad system in the Northeast region
      of the United States and have cost United States taxpayers many
      billions of dollars over original estimates;
        (2) current arrangements for the provision of rail freight and
      commuter service in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the
      United States are inadequate to meet the transportation needs of
      the public and the needs of national security;
        (3) although the Federal Government has provided billions of
      dollars in assistance for Conrail and its employees, the Federal
      interest in ensuring the flow of interstate commerce through rail
      service in the private sector has not been achieved, and the
      protection of interstate commerce requires Federal intervention
      to preserve essential rail service in the private sector;
        (4) the provisions for protection of employees of bankrupt
      railroads contained in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of
      1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have resulted in the payment of
      benefits far in excess of levels anticipated at the time of
      enactment, have imposed an excessive fiscal burden on the Federal
      taxpayer, and are now an obstacle to the establishment of
      improved rail service and continued rail employment in the
      Northeast region of the United States; and
        (5) since holding Conrail liable for employee protection
      payments would destroy its prospects of becoming a profitable
      carrier and further injure its employees, an alternative employee
      protection system must be developed and funded.

Sec. 1102. Statement of purpose

      It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in
    this subtitle to provide for - 
        (1) the removal by a date certain of the Federal Government's
      obligation to subsidize the freight operations of Conrail;
        (2) transfer of Conrail commuter service responsibilities to
      one or more entities whose principal purpose is the provision of
      commuter service; and
        (3) an orderly return of Conrail freight service to the private
      sector.

Sec. 1103. Goals and objectives

      It is the goal of this subtitle to provide Conrail the
    opportunity to become profitable through the achievement of the
    following objectives:
      (1) Nonagreement personnel
        (A) Employees who are not subject to collective bargaining
      agreements (hereafter in this section referred to as
      &quot;nonagreement personnel&quot;) should forego wage increases and
      benefits in an amount proportionately equivalent to the amount
      foregone by agreement employees pursuant to paragraph (4) of this
      section, adjusted annually to reflect inflation.
        (B) After May 1, 1981, the number of nonagreement personnel
      should be reduced proportionately to any reduction in agreement
      employees (excluding reductions pursuant to the termination
      program under section 797a of this title).
      (2) Suppliers
        To facilitate the orderly movement of goods in interstate
      commerce, materials and services should continue to be available
      to Conrail, under normal business practices, including the
      provision of credit and normal financing arrangements.
      (3) Shippers
        Conrail should utilize the revenue opportunities available to
      it under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and subtitle IV of title
      49.
      (4) Agreement employees
        (A) Conrail should enter into collective bargaining agreements
      with its employees which would reduce Conrail's costs in an
      amount equal to $200,000,000 a year, beginning April 1, 1981,
      adjusted annually to reflect inflation.
        (B) Agreements under this subparagraph may provide for
      reductions in wage increases and for changes in fringe benefits
      common to agreement employees, including vacations and holidays.
        (C) The cost reductions required under this subparagraph in the
      first year of the agreement may be deferred, but the aggregate
      cost reductions should be no less than an average of $200,000,000
      per year for each of the first three one-year periods beginning
      April 1, 1981.
        (D) The amount of cost reductions provided under this paragraph
      shall be calculated by subtracting the cost of an agreement
      entered into under this paragraph from (i) the cost that would
      otherwise result from the application of the national agreement
      reached by railroad industry and its employees, or (ii) until
      such national agreement is reached, the cost which the United
      States Railway Association estimates would result from the
      application of such a national agreement.

    Commission shall, with or without a hearing, issue a final decision
    within a period not to exceed 180 days after receipt of an

      Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle IV of title 49,
    in any proceeding before the Commission under section 11324 or
    11325 of title 49 involving a profitable railroad in the Region, as

    the issuance of the debt described in paragraph (1) may have such
    higher priority in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or
    abandonment of the assets of such a railroad than the debt
    described in such paragraph as the Secretary and the railroad may
    agree.
      (3) In carrying out the duties under this subsection, the
    Secretary may (A) enter into such agreements, (B) in accordance
    with any such agreements, cancel or cause to be cancelled or amend
    or cause to be amended any notes or securities currently held by
    agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, and (C) accept

      negotiations for employee transfers
      After January 1, 1983, Conrail shall be relieved of the

    shall commence negotiations not later than 120 days after August
    13, 1981, for the right of such employees to move from one service
    to the other once each six-month period. Such agreement shall
    ensure that Conrail, Amtrak, and Amtrak Commuter have the right to
    furlough one employee in the same class or craft for each employee
    who returns through the exercise of seniority rights. If agreement
    is not reached within 360 days, such matter shall be submitted to
    binding arbitration.

      Conrail employees who are deprived of employment by an assumption
    or discontinuance of intercity passenger service by Amtrak shall be

    Conrail employees deprived of employment or adversely affected by
    any such assumption or discontinuance.

      For the purpose of computing the amount for which certificates of
    value shall be redeemable under section 746 of this title, the
    series B preferred stock and the common stock conveyed to the
    Secretary under section 1107 (!1) of this title shall be deemed to
    be without fair market value unless in a proceeding brought under
    section 1105(a)(4) of this title the special court shall have
    determined that such securities had a value and shall have entered
    a judgment against the United States for that value. In such an
    event, the securities shall for purposes of section 746 of this
    title be deemed to have that value found by the special court.


Sec. 1116. Applicability of other laws

    interest of the United States in Conrail under the Conrail
    Privatization Act [45 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.].
      (b) The operation of trains by Conrail shall not be subject to
    the requirement of any State or local law which specifies the
    minimum number of crew members who must be employed in connection
    with the operation of such trains.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Constructing a Simple Derivation =

Our derivations consists two types of elements.

* ''Derived lines.''  A derived line has three parts:
:* ''Line number.''  This allows the line to be referred to later.
:* ''Formula.''  The purpose of a derivation is to derive formulae, and this is the formula that has been derived at this line.
:* ''Annotation.'' This specifies the justification for entering the formula into the derivation.
* ''Fencing.''  These include:
:* Vertical lines between the line number and the formula.  These are used to set off subderivations which we will get to in the next module.
:* Horizontal lines separating premises and temporary assumptions from other lines.  When we get to predicate logic, there are restrictions on using premises and temporary assumptions.  Setting them off in an easy-to-recognize fashion aids in adhering to the restrictions.

We sometimes are a bit sloppy and speak of the formula as if it were the entire line.  But the line also 
includes the formula's entourage, the line number and the annotation.

== Rules ==

=== Premises ===

The annotation for a premise is 'Premise'.  We will require that all premises to be used in the derivation 
be the first lines.  No non-premise line is allowed to appear before a premise.  In theory, an argument can 
have infinitely many premises.  However, derivations have only finitely many lines, so only finitely many 
premises can be used in the derivation.  We do not require that ''all'' premises appear before other 
lines.  This would be impossible for arguments with infinitely many premises.  But we do require that 
all premises to appear in the derivation appear before any other line.

The requirement that premises used in the derivation appear as its first lines is stricter than 
absolutely necessary.  However, certain restrictions that will be needed when we get to predicate 
logic make the requirement at least a useful convention.

=== Inference rules ===

We introduced all but two inference rules in the previous module, and will introduce the other 
two in the next module.

=== Axioms ===

This derivation system does not have any axioms.

== An example derivation ==

We will construct a derivation for the following argument:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q},\ \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{S},\ \mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


First, we enter the premises into the derivation:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 1.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 2.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|- 
| 3.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
|}
|}


Note the vertical line between the line numbers and the formulae.  That is part of the fencing that controls 
subderivations.  We will get to subderivations in the next module.  Until then, we simply put a single vertical line the length of the derivation.  Note also the horizontal line under the premises.  This is fencing that helps distinguish 
the premises from the other lines in the derivation.

Now we need to use the premises.  Applying KE to the first premise twice. we add the following lines:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 4.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-
| 5.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-
|}
|}


Now we need to use the second premise by applying CE.  Since CE has two antecedent lines, we first need to derive the other line that we will need.  We thus add these lines:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 6.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;5px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 4 DI
|-
| 7.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 2, 6 CE
|-
|}
|}


Now we will use the third premise by applying CE.  Again, we first need to derive the other line we will need.  The 
new lines are:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 8.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 5, 7 KI
|-
| 9.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 3, 8 CE
|-
|}
|}


Note line 9 is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the conclusion of our argument, so we are done.  The 
conclusion does not always fall into our lap so nicely, but here it did.  The complete derivation runs:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 1.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 2.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|- 
| 3.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{T}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 4.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-
| 5.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1 KE
|-

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Orage. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Orage~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm wondering if should make a separate section for the elements of a paper, maybe named, &quot;Elements of a Paper.&quot;

Right now I am editing &quot;Writing in the Humanities.&quot;  I am doing work on the Thesis Statement and Introduction.  But what I am finding is that the information on the Thesis Statement will apply to all papers written that require a thesis statement, not only to writing a paper in the humanities.

If we separate this out a little, it would give the student visiting this site the clearer picture of how to write a thesis statement, introduction, etc.

After doing some research, however, I may decide to keep it this way.  Writing a thesis statement for a paper in the humanities will differ a bit from writing a thesis statement for a paper in the sciences.


--[[User:tigerrat29|tigerrat29]] 11 October 2006 (UTC) There is a very solid foundation here.  I found at least one instance of &quot;sexist&quot; language, where all authors are referred to as &quot;he&quot;. We'll need to clean those out in order to be SCSU kosher.  Be looking for places to clean up phrasing, sometimes these authors use more words than necessary or unclear words.  The only other thing that I'd like to see happen on this page is some clarifying on the difference between &quot;interpretive&quot; and &quot;analytical&quot; writing.  Reading the entry here, I'm not sure there's a clear distinction.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Example: Configuring MS Visual C++ to use external libraries ===
The [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost library]] is used as example library.

{{NOTE|[http://www.boost.org/ Boost.org] has a install guide named Getting Started on Windows, that points to an automatic installed provided by [http://www.boostpro.com/products/free BoostPro Computing] (commonly supporting the previous and older  release versions), noting also that if used with the option “Source and Documentation” deselected (selected by default), it will not show the libs/ subdirectory. This will disable the user from rebuilding part of the libraries that aren't only header files. This makes installing it yourself as shown in this section the best option.|Panic2k4}} 

Considering you already have decompressed and have the binary part of the Boost library built. There the steps which have to be performed:

==== Include directory ====
Set up the ''include directory''. This is the directory that contains the header files (''.h/hpp''), which describes the library interface:

[[Image:Visual_studio_includedirectories.png|include directories]]

==== Library directory ====
Set up the ''library directory''. This is the directory that contains the pre-compiled library files (''.lib''):

[[Image:Visual_studio_librarydirectories.png|library directories]]

==== Library files ====
Enter library filenames in ''additional dependencies'' for the libraries to use:
[[Image:Visual_studio_additionaldependencies.png|library filenames (the Boost &quot;REGEXP&quot;-library in this example)]]&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Some libraries (such as e.g. Boost) use ''[[w:auto-linking|auto-linking]]'' to automate the process of selecting library files for linking, based on which header-files are included. Manual selection of library filenames are not required for such libraries if your compiler supports auto-linking.

==== Dynamic libraries ====
In case of dynamically loaded (''.dll'') libraries, one also has to place the DLL-files either in the same folder as the executable, or in the system [[w:Path (variable)|PATH]].

==== Run-time library ====
The libraries also have to be compiled with the same run-time library as the one used in your project. Many libraries therefore come in different editions, depending on whether they are compiled for ''single-'' or ''multi-threaded runtime'' and ''debug'' or ''release runtime'', as well as whether they contain ''debug symbols'' or not.

===Size Concerns===

First, reality is, the bigger your opponent relative to you, the harder it is to take him down. Period. However, using and avoiding certain positions and techniques can maximize the probability of success and minimize the probability of getting smashed, the latter of which is definitely a bad thing when you are much smaller than your opponent.

Second, the general rule with significantly larger opponents is that anything you do needs to keep the risk low of getting caught and squelched underneath your opponent at which point certain physics and mechanics will be working hard against you.

Third, I tend to avoid my final attack as being a traditional double, outside single, or inside single leg (except for a very low single leg sometimes) takedown as it gives too much of an opportunity for a much larger opponent to smash me down simply by virtue of the size and weight difference. Those shots tend to be feigns for other attacks.

Fourth, I tend to ultimately attack the head (i.e., the head and arm or front headlock) a lot with the idea that I would rather my smaller weight be on top of a larger weight than vice versa. This is frequently set up with leg attacks (and secured as my opponent pulls his leg back, lowers his hips, or sprawls to defend).

Fifth, with regard to throws for larger opponents, a fireman's carry (if down properly) or an arm throw (but to my knees as opposed to a backstep) seems to work for me as most larger opponents tend to try to push and over power you so those two throws allow me to get underneath them very deeply, like a fulcrum (i.e., my body remains upright, not bent over more vulnerable to getting squashed), and continue their motion to the ground although it is especially crucial with a larger opponent that you keep your grips and position tight. Any slack is likely doom. And it definitely sucks when somebody 50 to 100 pounds is sprawling on and squashing you. Been there, done that.

Sixth, not exactly a throw but I like an explosive inside trip if an opponent is not outrageously larger than me.

Sixth, with regard to other types of attacks, I will occasionally, but not particularly frequently, attack a very low single to the ankle. If I get in, I am usually in decent shape. If you fail on your entry, you get squashed (the obvious risk for this particular attack). I will try drags to get to and around my opponent's body frequently which tends to be my main strategy (i.e., get around behind). Again, pinging shots against a much larger opponent is not particularly wise.

Seventh, most much larger opponent's will tend to try to over power you so having good pummeling and tie ups are crucial. However, when going against a much larger opponent, you need to modify such by learning to keep a bit more space and changing position frequently so they can't simply get a good hold on you and overpower you. Traditional chest to chest pummeling or collar tie against a much larger and stronger opponent is risky. A two on one tie, for example, is less risky.

Eighth, my defense is good, and keeping with the notion that I would rather be above, than below, a much larger opponent, I sometimes will subtly get out of position to encourage my opponent to attack, preparing for such, and then keeping the back of his head at my lower abdomen, getting to head and arm position, etc. Then I spin behind or attack a choke (and then spin behind if defended well).

Ninth, if a much larger opponent does overpower you and you are losing it, accept the situation and immediately get your guard and deal with it from there. Bigger opponent's will take you down at least sometimes regardless of your skill, etc., simply based on the size difference. Therefore, getting to guard quickly and effective, and obviously having a game from there, is crucial as you will end up underneath some larger opponents.Then you might get pinned .

      <text xml:space="preserve">== LibrePOS Hardware Requirements ==
CPU: Pentium or Compatible
RAM: At least 64MB
== Known working hardware ==
The following hardware has been tested and found to work in LibrePOS. It is not a complete list, so if you don't find a hardware here it doesn't mean is isn't supported.
&lt;!-- you can add your hardware here --&gt;
===Printers===
*Citizen CBM1000 and Citizen Citizen CBM1000-II
*Epson TM-T88II and Epson TM-T88III
*Epson TM-T88IV Serial under Ubuntu Linux and Windows XP
*Epson TM-U220
*Epson TM-U230 Serial
*Epson TM-T881V Parallel
*Ithaca iTherm 280
*Ithaca 500 Ink Jet Parallel
*Star TSP100 USB on Windows XP
*Star TSP600
*Posligne  TRP 100 serial kubuntu
*Posligne  TRP 100 USB/XP

===Barcode Scanners===
*Any keyboard wedge scanner

===Touchscreen ===
*Epson SR-610
*Epson DM-LS121T
Touchscreens work like a mouse, so if the operating system supports it, it will be supported by LibrePOS

== Receipt Printers ==
==== USB ====
If you want to use a network printer or a usb printer (in windows), use the net use command, eg:
(from the command prompt) 

net use lpt1 \\computerName\printerName /persistent:yes

(You can find out what your printerName is by going to windows explorer and typing in 
\\computerName
The printer will (hopefully) come up in the list of network-available items.

Then in LibrePOS configuration, choose file and type in lpt1.

from: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q314499
and
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1357172&amp;forum_id=434921

==== Parallel ====
To test if your printer is well connected, issue the following commands. Change lpt1 or lp0 to whichever port you are using

'''Under Windows:'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; LPT1&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Under Linux'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; /dev/lp0&lt;/pre&gt;

Try configuring the printer as &quot;file&quot; and type in lpt1 (or /dev/lp0 for linux).

==== Serial ====
Check your cable. Some serial printers require a null modem cable, a standard serial cable+null modem adapter or even some other configuration in order to work, please check your manual or contact the manufacturer. Bytes2000 has confirmed in the forums that a Standard DB9 Null modem adapter from Radio Shack that implements the &quot;Loop back handshaking&quot; pin configuration

To test if your printer is well connected, issue the following commands. Change com1 or ttyS0 to whichever port you are using

'''Under Windows:'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; com1&lt;/pre&gt;
'''Under Linux'''
&lt;pre&gt;echo &quot;test&quot; &gt; /dev/ttyS0&lt;/pre&gt;

If the printer prints the word &quot;test&quot; then you are ready to go. On LibrePOS the easiest way to use the printer is with RXTX as it is bundled with LibrePOS.

Non Epson printers may have problems with the image command as the ESC/POS standard varies a bit from different manufacturers. In particular, some CBM printers can't handle the image command. If this happens, try [[../Administrator Guide#Editing_the_image|removing the image from the ticket]].

== Cash drawer ==
Ensure your printer can control your cash drawer. The drawer is controlled by the printer.

== Barcode scanner ==
&lt;!--By Randall Perry--&gt;

Bar code scanners come in many flavors from wands to handhelds to flat beds.  Scanners also have a variety of ways to attach to your PC terminal: USB, Serial, PS/2, BUS, Bluetooth.

The easiest to get working are the PS/2 model handhelds. They require NO software or configuration (typically).  They plug into a keyboard port and 'key in' the UPC barcode (and usually a carraige return).  The PS/2 barcode scanners work EXCELLENT with LibrePOS in the stores I have setup.
This is NOT just for adding inventory, but works to key in orders...Just like any other store does.

You can pickup used barcode scanners for $5 to $50.   These are adequate for reading UPC barcodes.  While laser scanners support data matrix, 2D, PDF417 and other formats...why spend the money for this? If you are only working retail, you will typically be using just plain vanilla UPC barcodes.  Save your money for a decent receipt printer.

The CueCat USB Port scanner works with zero configuration on Linux Fedora Core 6. The usbhid driver auto-detects and magically converts the data to numbers. Simply click in the barcode field in LibrePOS and run the scanner over a barcode. The cord is a good 6 feet long too. And, of course, the price is right when buying used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 23:29, 5 December 2007 (UTC) I rewrote a lot of this section. I hope I didn't step on your toes, Mark. But, then again, it is a Wiki; so, what's here today may be gone tomorrow anyway.

I redid the header, but I'm not attached to it, so changes or suggestions to make it more effective would be appreciated.  Also, I keep referring to the process as &quot;revising&quot; because of the chapter title, but really I feel like it sounds off when I don't refer to it in most places as &quot;revision.&quot;  The reason I don't is because I want to stay more inline with how the chapter refers to it so I don't make it confusing for people who might not be as advanced as some of us are.  Is this an issue?  --[[User:Hema|Hema]] 16:48, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

I agree that the professional editor section is problematic.  It also seems to completely ignore the idea that most, if not all, the people using this textbook probably are not using a professional editor anyways.  I'm striking it.  Someone can bring it back if they feel it's an error to get rid of it. --[[User:Hema|Hema]] 16:32, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

== Back to the Drawing Board == I think the Rhet and Comp book would be much better if we clarified our definition/description of revising and editing. I suggest we do the following: 
- Place Revision above Editing on the table of contents page
- Divide Revision into (a) Global Revision (i.e. overall organization/structure, cogency, purpose, supporting information, audience, etc) and (b) Sentence Level Revision (i.e. active verbs, parallelism, modification issues, concision, accuracy in word choice, etc.)
- Refuse to discuss any of the issues above in the section on editing (other than to say, &quot;If you have questions about word choice or usage, refer to the chapter on Revision). 
- Define editing as proofreading for grammatical errors (i.e. usage, pronoun-antecedent agreement, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, spelling, verb tense, adjective and adverb usage, capitalization, etc.)
- Clearly convey that editing is the last step before a paper is turned in

I also think the distinctions between editing and revising only become more muddled when one discusses the tasks of professional editors. Professional editors do not just edit as I have defined it above. They are very much involved in revision as well. It's actually unfortunate we don't call them professional revisers. I think all the discussion about professional editors is superfluous and misleading. I'd really like to see these two chapters revised!--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 21:51, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps this page is more on track than I thought. It includes a section showing the distinctions between revising and editing and proofreading, which I like. Can we take the editing chapter and include it in this chapter. The chapter could be renamed--Revising, Editing, Proofreading. I think separate chapters include too much overlap of material. For example, the editing chapter includes a section on micro vs. macro editing. Macro editing, however, is basically the same thing as revision. So much for being concise. To me it makes much more sense to lump all of this information into one chapter.--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 22:42, 29 November 2007 (UTC)  


--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 23:07, 16 October 2005 (UTC) I'm a bit concerned here that we're not sure what &quot;revising&quot; is and how it differs from editing, reviewing, and proofreading. I'd suggest you re-read the chapter about the writing process and make we're making a clear distinction here for the reader.

''Remember E.B. White's mantra: &quot;Omit needless words. Omit needless words. Omit needless words.&quot;''  - This is great.

Would it be beneficial to include the difference between revising, editing, and proofreading in ALL of these sections?
--[[User:Emily.isackson|Emily.isackson]] ([[User talk:Emily.isackson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Emily.isackson|contribs]]) 21:04, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

Point of confusion: I'm not sure how the version that I'm looking at today has been changed since Matt Barton's October 16, 2005 comment about the need to make clearer distinctions for the reader. As is, I understood the explanations of the differences between revising, editing, and proofreading.

Why use an asterisk in &quot;sh*t&quot;? 

&quot;Read and re-read your paper. In the first read-through consider overall purpose of the paper and whether it is expressed clearly.&quot; -- seems to be missing &quot;the&quot; before &quot;overall purpose&quot;

I really like this kind of commentary:

''But wait--don't you need to inflate your text so you can meet the minimum word count? Wouldn't it be better to use &quot;due to the fact that&quot; for &quot;because&quot; and &quot;in addition to&quot; for &quot;and,&quot; since these phrases use far more words? Answer: NO. Any experienced reader will instantly see through such a pitiful scheme and will likely become irritated by the resulting &quot;flabby&quot; prose.''

... because it hits the wordiness nail on the head, and it's also opinionated and funny.

&quot;you probably havea a problem with organization and transitions.&quot; -- should be &quot;you probably have a a problem with organization and transitions.&quot;

The &quot;conclusions&quot; section could probably be fleshed out. --[[User:Matt.helm|Matt.helm]] ([[User talk:Matt.helm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Matt.helm|contribs]]) 21:23, 27 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Electrical Engineering ==
I've created a category for electrical engineering books. use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:Electrical Engineering]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to add this book to that category, if desired. If this book doesnt start to progress eventually (and i know writing a book takes time) I will probably start a motion to merge this book with a more general book on &quot;Electromechanical Devices&quot; that i am planning to start writing in the weeks ahead. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 23:12, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

== Stub==

This book is a stub. It hasnt been edited since June for any reason other then to add proposed sections to the current &quot;table of contents&quot; and a spam revert. The two pages that this book does have are short, and uninformative. I will probably put this book up for deletion soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
:Since this is up for deletion I have taken it upon myself to begin editing this book and replace some of the original content which was very unstructured and not very informative. I have also added a section in which some info on vector algebra could be placed, I propose something which covers the following:  a reasonable discussion of scalar fields, vector fields, vector algebra and vector calculus covering the following concepts
:*Scalar fields versus vector fields, how vectors have both magnitude and direction
:*Product of a scalar and a vector
:*Magnitudes and unit vectors
:*Vector addition and subtractionee a 
:*The scalar (dot) product of vectors
:*The vector (cross) product of vectors
:*Vector integration including line and surface integration
:The cross-product is particularly crucial as it greatly aids in determining the direction of the forces on a moving charge in a magnetic field.--[[User:crobar|crobar]]

::Great! For what it is worth, it isn't up for deletion and if you disagree with merging this page somewhere else you can take down the merge sign (at both pages if applicable).  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:32, 15 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the study of engineering signals and systems, from a discipline-neutral approach. It is a fundamental starting point in the field of engineering, and serves as the basic material that other advanced books in the engineering subject area are based. This book looks at the concepts of systems, serving as an introduction to systems theory. Also, this book examines signals, and the way that signals interact with physical systems. 

While this book strives to be discipline-neutral, it currently is focused strongly on electrical engineering concepts. It is hoped that this book will be expanded to include information from other disciplines as well.

== What this book is not ==

Like with the other EE books, i am going to list here what i think the scope of this book ''should be'', although this is certainly not set in stone.

#This is not a math book. We are not here to teach math, that is the job of the Math bookshelf. We cannot, however limit this book to the tools that are provided in math books because most math books do not give any coverage (at least no adequate coverage) to the Fourier, Laplace, or Z Transforms. We can introduce what we need here, but there is no sense rewriting what other people have already written.
#This book has a clear focus. The [[Circuit Theory]] and the [[Circuit Theory 2]] wikibook cover basic hardware topics, and in a sense this book will cover the &quot;software&quot;. This book will examine signals, and will demonstrate techniques for analyzing signals. Also, this book will consider hardware topics, but we are past the stage where we need to be diagramming the locations of individual circuit components. 
#This book has a clear scope. Like any wikibook, it is counter-productive to include more information in this book then logically belongs here. By making the EE bookshelf highly modular, we allow for people who are taking divergent learning paths (Electrical Engineers versus Computer Engineers, Electromechanical Engineers, Automotive Engineers, or Biomedical Engineers) To read on the topics that interest them, without loading the reader down with excess baggage. This book should be limited to studies of signals, Fourier analysis, Z-transform analysis, and an introduction to basic filters. More advanced topics can be saved for another wikibook.
#This book should have lots of pictures. A study of electric signals is best facilitated by having lots and lots of pictures. In a sense, this is the trade-off: less math, and more graphs.

I've outlined on [[User:Whiteknight|my user page]] a basic EE &quot;curriculum&quot; that i think forms a very natural progression of EE-based learning, while at the same time allowing people to diverge into different &quot;specialties&quot; as their interest dictates. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 22:15, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

== need some diagrams ==

I feel like i've written up skeletons of all the pages that i can without supporting images. The remainder of the chapters in this book will be heavily graphical, by necessity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)



== Stability, transient performance ==

Since this book is also about Systems, shouldn't it have some sections about system stability and transient response? And perhaps things like negative feedback, root locus diagrams, and other useful things (I'm currently taking a class in Control Systems so I'm no expert on the subject, just trying to give some suggestions - what I've mentioned is all we've learned so far) --[[User:Gautamraj|Gautamraj]] Sun Nov  6 08:35:01 UTC 2005

:I would like to write a book about all those subjects, because i also have taken a number of control classes (classical controls, modern controls, digital controls). However, i feel like the addition of all those subjects into this book would cause this book to grow far too large, and lose way too much focus. Instead, i am preparing an outline of a future book that will encompass many different types of electrical control systems. you can find the outline for this book at [[Control Systems]]. Let me know if you have any suggestions about that book, but i probably won't put it into active duty for a long while now (until i can better expand it). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:19, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

== Electrical Engineering, Basic signals ==

That book was merged into Signals and Systems at 19:25, 9 December 2005 (UTC). The primary contributer was [[User:WarrenWilkinson]]. Here is the contents of the talk page to that book:

----
To others who would wish to help author this wikibook, I recommend we keep detailed deriviations and proofs and advanged applications of things like the Forier Transforms, forier series, Laplace transforms and convolution in seperate eBooks and link to them in the prerequisites. That way this very advanced information can be centralized for all wikibooks to link too. In this book we should cover the application and usuage of these things, and link to more advanced texts that prove these theroums.

[[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 01:14, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== title of book ===

maybe this should just be called introduction to signal processing? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:38, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I think that's a bit narrow. This book already has a section on filters (which are systems), and I would like to cover more systems eventually here as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

=== Spelling and zeroes ===

Good work to the person who started compiling this book. I however, recommend that someone needs to go through and check the spelling properly. I am just about to go through and fix some of the spelling mistakes I've seen, and take out some of the rubbish that people have edited in: Example, string of zeros. &lt;br&gt;
I'm considering seriously contributing to this book, and I'll try to stick to the recommended guideline of linking detailed proofs.&lt;br&gt;
Although, if the text does become more comprensive at some stage, adding them might be cool, as long as they are clearly seperate from the more concise statements and applications.

== New Sections ==

I would like to start adding new sections to this book, because it is currently very small and could handle new information. I would like to include more information about the frequency-domain, and I would like to add a section on digital domain (z-transform introduction, digital filters by poles and zeros, etc). If anybody else can think of other subjects that would go well in this book, write about them here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:52, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Do Commas Do? ==

As you can see in the list below, commas serve several different purposes. For now, don’t worry about any unfamiliar terms; simply observe the main actions commas do: ''join, emphasize, contain'', and ''separate''.

# They work with a coordinating conjunction to '''join two independent clauses''' within a sentence. 
# They '''emphasize introductory elements''' at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
# They '''set off cumulative elements''' at the end of a sentence or clause.
# They '''separate a dependent clause at the beginning of a sentence''' from the independent clause following it.
# They work in pairs to '''contain restrictive modifiers''' within a sentence.
# They work in pairs to '''contain parenthetical expressions''' within a sentence.
# They '''separate two or more adjectives''' that independently describe the same noun.
# They '''separate quotations''' from their attributions. 
# They '''separate items in a list.'''
# They '''separate elements in dates, numbers, personal titles, and addresses.'''

While there are many different ways to use commas in writing, most comma usages fall into three situations. If you know the basic rule for these three cases, you should be set for comma usage. 

# Put a comma before a coordinating conjunction '''(for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)''' that separates two independent clauses. ''Example: I wanted to drive to the mall''', but''' my car wouldn't start.'' 
# Put a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. ''Example: '''Although''' it was a good offer''',''' I felt that I needed to explore other options.'' 
# Use commas to set off elements that interrupt or add information in a sentence. ''Example: Tommy''', my older brother,''' loved to punch me for telling his secrets.''

== Commas with two independent clauses ==

Used with coordinating conjunctions, commas allow writers to let readers know how their complete thoughts (as expressed in independent clauses) relate to one another. After all, our thoughts build on each other and interact with each other. Unless we’re merely listing things or free-associating, our thoughts rarely develop in separate “boxes,” but rather tend more to develop in relationship with one another. 

When it’s time to put those thoughts into written text, commas used with coordinating conjunctions help us indicate the relationships among our thoughts. They help us avoid the choppy, flat style that comes from every thought becoming a separate separate sentence, walled off from other sentences with the finality of a period:

'''Example of periodic text:''' ''Building consensus ends with synthesis. It begins with analysis. Of course, the ultimate goal is finding commonality. The final product is a single course of action. However, a consensus derives validity only from agreement among the many. The first step in reaching consensus is to survey the different viewpoints involved.''

If we add commas with coordinating conjunctions to this group of sentences, our reader will be able to see more clearly the relationships that exist among the complete thoughts:

'''The same text with commas and coordinating conjunctions:''' ''Building consensus ends with synthesis, '''but''' it begins with analysis. Of course, the ultimate goal is finding commonality&lt;b&gt;, and &lt;/b&gt; the final product is a single course of action. However, a consensus derives validity only from agreement among the many&lt;b&gt;, so &lt;/b&gt; the first step in reaching consensus is to survey the different viewpoints involved.''

=== The formula ===

Use a comma to join two independent clauses (IC) with a coordinating conjunction (CC). Place the comma before the coordinating conjunction.

'''IC, CC IC.'''

Coordinating Conjunctions--For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet and So--are often referred to by the mnemonic device used to memorize them: FANBOYS

=== Errors ===

A comma and a coordinating conjunction must appear together in order to have enough “strength” to join two independent clauses. These errors happen when one or the other is missing:

Two independent clauses joined by just a coordinating conjunction (no comma) or joined by nothing at all -- they just collide --  is called a '''run-on sentence''' or sometimes a '''fused sentence'''.

'''Examples of run-on or fused sentences:'''
* ''Several environmental organizations recognized the treaty but few endorsed it.''
* ''Internet communities redefine the notion of space they take the concept beyond physical dimensions.''

Two independent clauses joined by just a comma (no coordinating conjunction) is called a '''comma splice'''.

'''Example of a comma splice:''' ''Economists predicted lower personal debt loads resulting from tax cuts, this did not happen.''

== Commas with introductory words and phrases ==

Another relationship between thoughts we signal to our readers is that of '''introduction'''. We often want to give our readers some background before laying out our main thought, or we want to give some information first that limits or otherwise modifies the information in our main thought. Introductory elements can be one word or several so long as they do not contain a finite verb. An introductory element that includes a finite verb is likely to be a clause instead. Common ones are '''transition words''' and '''statements about time, place, manner, or condition'''.

Using a comma after an introductory element requires your reader to pause, and so should only be done with good reason. 

===Introductory Words ===

Introductory words are set off with a comma when the introductory word is a participle, modifies the entire clause following it, or when not including it might lead to misreading.

'''Examples of sentences with introductory words:'''
* ''Humiliated, she fled from the diner.'' (participle)
* ''Moreover, several groups actively opposed the treaty.'' (modifies entire clause)
* ''Inside, traders shouted orders out.'' (''Inside Traders'' would be ambiguous)
* ''Quickly tie your shoe'' (''Quickly'' is a simple adverb, it only modifies ''tie.'')

===Introductory Phrases ===

Introductory phrases are not set off with a comma without good reason. Phrases that contain verbals, absolute phrases, long prepositional phrases, or compound prepositional phrase are set off. Short prepositional phrases are only set off for purposes of emphasis. Phrases that show inversion in sentence structure can also be followed by a comma.

'''Examples of sentences with introductory phrases:'''
* ''Calling in sick for work, Beth hoped her boss would not suspect anything.'' (Phrase contains a verbal)
* ''The stock market falling in Tokyo, Alex called his stock broker.'' (Absolute phrase)
* ''Beneath the antique wooden fishing boat, barnacles had grown for years.'' (Long introductory phrase, but even here the comma is optional.)
* ''Underneath the noses of her parents, Ruth had hoarded three kilograms of cocaine.'' (Compound prepositional phrase)
* ''In a cold sweat, Henry read the letter addressed to his wife.'' (emphasis)
* ''Drunk and angry, Joel burst into the room.'' (inverted structure)
* ''After school I went to my uncle's house.'' (short prepositional phrase)
* ''Before the parade I want to eat pizza.'' (short prepositional phrase)
* ''By the earthen hearth my mother read to me from the book of Acts.'' (short prepositional phrase)

== Commas with cumulative clauses ==

Another type of relationship between ideas that we signal to readers with a comma is that of '''accumulation'''. Occurring at the end of a sentence, '''cumulative clauses''' hook up to a main clause and add further information. Using cumulative clauses is a good way to avoid having to use two sentences when one will do.

'''Examples of sentences with cumulative clauses:'''
* ''Nine senators changed their vote, passing the bill into law.''
* ''Three years of above-average rainfall raised the water table, turning formerly usable fields into wetlands.''
* ''Peers frequently reinforce the behavior, leading it to become an ingrained habit.''

== Commas and dependent clauses ==
Remember, when you read a '''dependent clause''' aloud, you or your listener has the feeling of “Well...? What’s next? Finish it up!” A dependent clause is a group of words that can’t stand on its own as a sentence because it does not express a complete thought. It leaves the listener (and reader) hanging.

'''Examples of dependent clauses:'''
* ''although psychology and applied psychology are separate disciplines''
* ''when sanctions proved too difficult to enforce''
* ''because it was undated''

Dependent clauses, as their name implies, &quot;depend&quot; on another clause to form a complete sentence. Dependent clauses must be paired with independent clauses. 

=== The formula ===

When the dependent clause comes before the independent clause, use a comma after the dependent clause.
: '''DC, IC.'''

When the dependent clause comes after the independent clause, just run right through without a comma.
: '''IC DC.'''

'''Examples:'''
* ''Although psychology and applied psychology are separate disciplines, they both are relatively recent additions to the university.''
* ''The U.N. approved military action when sanctions proved too difficult to enforce.''
* ''Archaeologists used contextual clues to date the manuscript because it was undated.''

=== Errors ===

A '''disruptive comma''' is one used before a dependent clause that comes after the independent clause. Writers often make this mistake when the dependent clause begins with because.

'''Examples of disruptive commas:'''
* ''The future of print newspapers appears uncertain, due to rising production costs and the increasing popularity of online news sources.''
* ''Some argue that print newspapers will never disappear, because of their many readers.''

== Commas and restrictive modifiers ==

You know what it's like to talk to someone and add explanations as you go, even right in the middle of your thoughts, to make sure your listener knows exactly which things you are talking about? When those explanantions show up in a written sentence, they are called '''modifiers'''. Modifiers can be '''nonrestrictive''' -- meaning that you can drop them out of a sentence and you won't change the meaning. '''Restrictive''' modifiers are ones whose meaning is essential to the overall meaning of the sentence; if you dropped a restrictive modifier, the meaning of the sentence would change.

'''Use a pair of commas to set off a nonrestrictive clause. Don't use commas around restrictive clauses.'''

'''Examples:'''
* ''The committee, headed by Dr. Suarez, met weekly to develop a budget.''
*: In this sentence, the phrase &quot;headed by Dr. Suarez&quot; is nonessential to the meaning of the main clause, which is that the committee met weekly. Presumably only one committee has been under discussion in previous sentences. However, if the discussion is of several committees, and the writer wants to point out that it was that one specific committee headed by Dr. Suarez that met weekly, the commas would be removed:
* ''The committee headed by Dr. Suarez met weekly to develop a budget.''
* ''Employees who participate in the company's fitness classes pay a lower health insurance premium.''
*: Here, no commas are used, since it is not just any and all employees who pay a lower health premium, but only those who participate in the company's fitness program. Notice the difference in the next sentence, in which the nonrestrictive modifier adds information but wouldn't change the meaning if it was taken out:
* ''Employees, who have access to the company's gym and fitness classes, are encouraged to practice preventive healthcare. ''

== Commas and parenthetical elements ==

Much like a nonrestrictive modifier, a parenthetical expression provides extra information or commentary in the middle of a sentence. A parenthetical element, however, often sounds more obviously &quot;speech-like&quot; and interjectory. Use a pair of commas to set off a parenthetical element.

'''Examples:'''
* ''The candidate, much to the committee's surprise, voluntarily revealed her positions on several key controversies.''
* ''The question has, incidentally, since become moot.''

== Commas with multiple adjectives ==

When you use more than one descriptive word (adjective) to describe something (a noun), ask yourself whether the adjectives work independently to describe the noun, or if they build on each other and work together to describe the noun. 

One way to tell is to reverse the order of the adjectives. If you can reverse the order and the meaning stays the same, the adjectives are working independently and should be separated by a comma. If you reverse the order and it doesn't make sense, the adjectives are working together and should not be separated by a comma. 

Another test is to put &quot;and&quot; between the adjectives. If you can do that and retain the meaning, the adjectives are working independently and need a comma between them. If inserting &quot;and&quot; between the adjectives changes the meaning, the adjectives are working together and shouldn't be separated from each other by a comma. 

'''If multiple adjectives before a noun work independently, use a comma between them. If they work together, don't.'''
   
'''Examples of adjectives working independently:'''
* ''An open, exploratory, and inclusive spirit marked the meeting.''
*: '''Test:''' ''An open '''and''' exploratory '''and''' inclusive spirit marked the meeting.''
* ''A direct, conversational tone made the instructions easy to understand.''
*: '''Test:''' ''A conversational, direct tone made the instructions easy to understand.''

'''Examples of adjectives working together:'''
* ''Local health officials recently released guidelines for dealing with avian flu outbreaks.''
*: '''Test:''' ''Health local officials recently released guidelines for dealing with flu avian outbreaks.'' '''Do not use commas.'''
* ''An extruded plastic stem keeps the component stable.''
*: '''Test:''' ''An extruded '''and''' plastic stem keeps the component stable.'' '''Do not use a comma.'''

== Commas with quotations ==

Use a comma to set off the '''attribution''' -- the phrase that says who said or wrote a quotation -- from the quotation itself. Notice that the comma goes inside the quotation marks, even if the quotation is a complete sentence and would, if appearing on its own, take a period at the end.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''&quot;The ballot is stronger than the bullet,&quot; writes Abraham Lincoln.''
:* ''&quot;Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies,&quot; said Groucho Marx.''

Use a pair of commas to set off the attribution when it appears in the middle of the quotation.
: '''Example:''' ''&quot;In a time of universal deceit,&quot; writes George Orwell, &quot;telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.&quot;''

Do not replace a question mark or exclamation point in a quotation with a comma.
: '''Example:''' ''&quot;When will our consciences grow so tender that we will act to prevent human misery rather than avenge it?&quot; writes Eleanor Roosevelt.''

Do not use a comma to set off quotations that occupy a subordinate position in a sentence, often signaled by the words '''that''', '''which''', or '''because'''.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''Emphasizing the importance of staying in touch with the populace, James Madison wrote that &quot;a popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or both.&quot;''
:* ''Participating in a democracy takes a strong stomach because &quot;it requires a certain relish for confusion,&quot; writes Molly Ivins.''

== Commas in a list ==

Use commas between items in a list when there are three or more. 

The final comma, the one before &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot;, is known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma or serial comma. The Oxford comma should always be used where it is needed to avoid confusion (for example where one or more items in the list already include the word &quot;and&quot;). Otherwise it is optional. The Oxford comma is relatively uncommon in British English, except where used to avoid confusion. Not using the Oxford comma is relatively uncommon in American English, except in newspapers and magazines.

'''Examples:'''
* ''Additional supplies required are a burner, beaker(,) and safety goggles.''
* ''The position requires expertise in building consensus, formulating policy(,) and developing long-range goals.''
* ''The English-speaking countries include Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.''

== Commas in dates, numbers, personal titles, and addresses ==

Use commas to separate the day of the week from the month and to set off a year from the rest of the sentence.
: '''Examples:'''
:* &quot;On Friday, February 13, 2015, we will be having our annual Valentine's Day dance.
:* ''On December 12, 1890, orders for the arrest of Sitting Bull were sent.''
:* ''Graduation is set for May 20, 2006.''

You do not need to use a comma when giving only the month and the year.
: '''Example:''' ''The next presidential election will take place in November 2008.''

Use commas to separate number into groups of three when they are more than four digits long. The comma is optional when the number is four digits long.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''2,400 (or 2400)''
:* ''50,000''
:* ''340,000''

Do not use a comma in street addresses or page numbers.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''The table appears on page 1397.''
:* ''The fire occurred at 5509 Avenida Valencia.''

When following a name with a title, use a comma (if the title is at the end of the sentence) or two (if the title is in the middle of the sentence) to separate the title from the rest of the sentence.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''Paul Hjort, D.C., practices chiropractic medicine in central Minnesota.''
:* ''Earnings far exceeded projections last quarter, according to Hitomi Masamura, Vice President for Operations.''

Separate each element of an address is with commas. However, do not use a comma before a ZIP or other postal code.
: '''Examples:'''
:* ''Bob Dole grew up in Hope, Kansas.''
:* ''Write to the program advisor at 645 5th Street, Minerton, Indiana 55555.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">People have been around for a long time.  More than four thousand years ago, they were building pyramids in Egypt.  Three thousand years ago, the Zhou dynasty ruled in China, King David sat on the throne in Israel, and the Greeks were fighting a war against Troy. Two thousand years ago, Jesus Christ and Augustus Caesar were alive.  A thousand years ago, William the Conqueror invaded England.  And just a few dozen years ago, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. 
The fascinating thing about history that by re-telling the past, it teaches us about the present and in doing so, it lays the foundation for our future. Think about that! Everything you see around you every day, every item you use and every word you say has is own unique history. So, on the one hand, history is a linear sequence of events while on the other it is the story that explains why things are they way they are. 

People learn history for many reasons.  You may want to understand how things happen, and why.  You may be interested in the great art or the great scientific discoveries of the past.  You may want to learn the truth behind stories you have heard about Helen of Troy or Romeo and Juliet.  Or you may just want to hear entertaining stories that are true.

How to begin?  One way is to begin at the beginning, with the history of people who lived near river banks, such as the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, the Huanghe Valley and the Nile Valley civilisations.  The trouble with that is that you may grow up and grow old before you ever get to the history that your parents and grandparents lived through.  Some people begin by learning the history of their own land, and leave for later the history of other lands and other peoples.  Some people are only interested in things that are happening now, or in their lifetimes, or in their parents or grandparents lifetimes.  

It seems to me that the best way to learn history is to make several quick passes through history -- like the one you read in the first paragraph of this Wikibook. If you want to know more, you can branch off to study any of the many topics that are lightly covered here.

==Things that are the same; things that are different==

All human beings, in all places and at all times, are born, grow up, and die, we laugh and cry, we sing and dance, we trade, we raise families, we eat and drink, we sleep.  These are things that we have in common with the people of the past.  

But people live in many different ways.  There are times when many people grow old, and other times when most people die young.  There are times when people live in peace, and other times when they are caught up in wars.  Some people hunt, some farm, some work in factories.  Art, music, religion, family life, customs and laws all differ widely from place to place and time to time.  Each culture has its unique forms of expression: the dances of the Bantu peoples, the music of the Beatles. 

==Big changes==

There have been people on earth for more than a million years if, by a person, you mean someone who walks on their hind legs and can make a spear.  The first million years of human existence is sometimes called the stone age.  People spread out over the earth, from the steaming jungles to the frigid north.  A few tens of thousands of years ago, something wonderful happened.  All over the world people began to develop new tools, new forms of art, musical instruments, and began to bury their dead.  Before that time, primitive tools from widely separated places look very much alike.  After that time, human artifacts take on an almost infinite variety of distinctive forms.  This is the age of the cave paintings, of the European drawings of buffalo and the African drawings of antelope.  These works of art differ not only in subject but in style.  This age is called the Neolithic age (or new stone age).  In 2005, scientists isolated two genes that they think may be the cause of this wonderful change, but the discovery is too new for anybody to say for sure.  

Stone age peoples were hunter/gatherers.  They ate animals and what roots and berries they could find growing wild.  There was never enough food, and so people organized into tribes and constantly fought with other tribes.  Many of the bones dug up from this period show signs of wounds from spears or clubs.  Life was, as a writer named Hobbes put it, &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;

==Banding Together== 

The next big change came about ten thousand years ago, when some people learned to farm.  You need a lot of water to farm, and the first farms were along the banks of rivers.  Farmers also tamed animals, and used them for milk and food, and their skins for shelter and clothing.  The start of farming is called the agricultural revolution.

These farmers were the first people to invent writing; the earliest writing comes down to us from this period.  It is mostly very practical writing -- lists of trade goods, tax records, and laws.  There are also religious books, and stories.  One of the earliest stories is the story of Gilgamesh.

These farmers were surrounded by people who still lived as hunter/gatherers, and there was constant warfare between the two groups.  Farmers organized into city states, and then into empires.  They called the hunter/gatherers &quot;barbarians&quot;.  When the city states and empires were not fighting off invasions by barbarians, city would fight city, empire would fight empire.  There was seldom enough food to go around, a problem made worse by war, disease, insects, and drought.  Still, farming could support many more people than hunting, and the number of people grew rapidly all over the earth, until it soon reached the limit that farming could support.  Many of these farming people, of all races and in all lands, captured slaves in battle and forced them to work the land.  Life was hard.  The men must plow and sow and reap.  A woman's life was even harder, spinning, weaving, sewing, preparing the food, and looking after the children.  There was a saying, &quot;A man must work from sun to sun, but a woman's work is never done.&quot;  The children had to work, too, and many children died young.  A woman would often have a dozen children, and many women died giving birth.

For a few people, life was not so hard.  People who were stronger, or were natural leaders, or were smarter, or maybe just lucky, set themselves up as kings, and took for themselves and their families the lion's share of everything.  Sometimes, the kings enjoyed art, music, and philosophy, and would provide for people who could write or draw or sing or make interesting conversation.  Most kings were interested in hunting and fighting.  And most people were farmers.  They were born, and worked all their lives, and died within a few miles of the place they were born.  They knew nothing about the wider world.  Still, they sang and danced at harvest time, prayed to their gods for rain, held festivals and fairs at which traders could offer their wares.  Traders were a special class; they were almost the only people who traveled and who knew something of the wider world.

This is how people lived for thousands of years.  The history of these times is almost exclusively a history of kings and the wars they fought.  A few great works of art were created that have survived: The Iliad and The Odyssey, the Analects of Confucius, the Tao Te Ching, religious books such as The Bible and the Koran, the plays of the ancient Greeks, the laws and letters of the ancient Romans, the mathematics of Euclid, Archimedes, and Brahamagupta, the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, the history of Heroditous and Thucidides.  And there are the great works of stone and marble: the pyramids, the sphinx, the Parthenon, the Colosseum, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, the Alhambra. 

But most of the famous names of history are famous kings and warriors: Ashurbanipal, Nebuchadnezzar, Agamemnon, David, Alexander, Caesar, Chandragupta ... the list is endless. 

In various places and at various times, science made a fitful beginning in advancing our understanding of nature.  The Greek scientist Eratosthenes discovered the size of the earth.  A Chinese scientist whose name has not come down to us invented gunpowder.  In India, a mathematician invented a marvelous new number system, called the Base Ten numbers, which spread across the entire world.  But these scientists lived and died and the people returned to superstition and forgot what had been learned.  

==The Beginnings of the Modern Age==
That changed about five hundred years ago, in Europe, in a period called the Renaissance.  Human life began to change, and change dramatically.  Beginning with a Polish scientist, Nicholas Copernicus, in 1543, modern science grew to a point where it was self sustaining.  No nation without science could successfully compete with a nation that knew science, and mankind entered the scientific age.  This change is called the industrial revolution.  The majority of people were still, as always, ignorant and superstitious, but governments were usually careful to nurture scientists, because of the wonderful inventions they could make.

People flocked to cities to work in factories.  While in earlier ages most people lived in the country, working on farms, today most people live in cities.  At first, industrial cities were crowded, dirty, and disease ridden.  In London, the skies were black with soot, and after working for twelve hours in a factory, the people would crowded into bars, called gin mills, to spend their hard earned coins and drink themselves into a stupor -- it was the only way they could sleep amid the stench and the crowds.  Children had to work, too, and the gin mills had steps that small children could climb to exchange their hard earned coins for a shot of gin.  If the cities were such horrible places, why did people flock to them in such numbers?  Because it beat farming.

Then several things began to happen.  The number of people that modern farms could feed was  much greater than the number that the old style of farming could provide for.  Also, as the science of medicine began to cure diseases, people began to live longer, and fewer babies died.  The population began to explode.

==How Things are Today==
Today, the people of the world are divided into two groups, the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;.  The rich nations use new inventions to produce great wealth, and the people who live in these countries have decided to have fewer children, so there is more to go around.  The poor nations have less technology, people have many children, and there is never enough to go around.  

Very gradually, things are getting better.  For the first time since the age of science began, the rate of population growth is beginning to slow, and each year there are fewer starving people in the world.

Not everyone likes all of these new things, however.  Many people yearn for the days when each generation lived in the same way that their ancestors did.

Notice how change is getting quicker and quicker.  The stone age lasted more than a million years.  The Neolithic age lasted tens of thousands of years, the agricultural age lasted thousands of years.  The industrial age has, so far, only lasted hundreds of years.  

Some people believe we are on the brink of a new age, the information age, which may change our lives as much as the change from life on a farm to life in a modern city.  Nobody knows what the future holds.

==Religious leaders, philosophers, and scientists==

A wise king can make a difference in the lives of his subjects, and a cruel or stupid king can cause a great deal of suffering, but few kings have any lasting effect on their society.  So much of written history is about kings because kings are powerful enough to make sure their names get written down a lot.

The people who really make a lasting difference are religious leaders, philosophers, and scientists.

Between the building of the pyramids more than four thousand years ago and the Greek attack on Troy about three thousand years ago, one of the world's leading religions began in India.  The Hindu religion has more than 800,000,000 followers, about 90% of them on the Indian subcontinent.  If you want to learn about Hinduism, a good place to start is by reading the Bhagavad Gita, which is a conversation between a man, Prince Arjuna, and his charioteer Lord Krishna, who just before an epic battle reveals himself as, Vishnu, God Incarnate.  

A few hundred years after the Greeks invaded Troy, the Greek poet, Homer, wrote down the story of the Trojan War in two epic poems, The Iliad and The Odyssey.  Greek writers and thinkers treated these two books in much the same way that Christian writers and thinkers draw on the Bible, as a source inspiration.

Midway between the Trojan war and the days of the Caesars, about 400 B.C., several great philosophers and religious leaders lived.  

In China, Kung Fu Tze (sometimes called Confucius) wrote The Analects, one of the most influential books in history.  Confucius taught that respect for order, for family, for authority, and for ancestors was the cornerstone of all right action.  In India, Guatama Buddha taught that the cause of all suffering is desire.  In Greece, the philosopher Plato wrote a number of dialogs which still make delightful reading today, and the philosopher Aristotle became the first person to write down the rules of logical thinking.  Greek speaking people, especially Euclid, in Egypt, and Archimedes, in Sicily, wrote down the foundations of modern science and mathematics, but the people of Europe turned away from science and mathematics and toward religion and superstition.  After age of the Greeks there were no new scientific or mathematical discoveries in Europe for more than a thousand years.

While Augustus Caesar was ruling the Roman Empire, Jesus Christ was born.  We date our calendar from the approximate year of his birth.  Jesus Christ was a Jew, and the Christian religion was based on the Hebrew religion.  The Christian holy book, the Bible, includes two parts.  The Old Testament describes how God created the world, and includes Jewish law, history, philosophy, and song.  The New Testament describes the life of Jesus Christ and his followers.  Jesus summed up his message in these words, in Matthew 22: 37-39, &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot;

Between the days of the Caesars, and the conquest of England by William the Conqueror, Muhammad founded the religion of Islam.  A follower of Islam is called a Muslim.  The teachings of Muhammad are given in the Koran.  The Five Pillars of Islam are profession of faith, ritual prayer five times each day, fasting during Ramadan, charity given to the needy, and pilgrimage to Mecca.

In the year 1543 of the Common Era, in Poland, Nicholas Copernicus published a book demonstrating that the Earth circles the sun.  This was the beginning of the Age of Science.  Galileo used the telescope to examine the planets of the solar system; Isaac Newton invented the mathematics called calculus, and was the father of modern physics; Charles Darwin spent many years traveling around the world, observing nature, and discovered evolution; Albert Einstein defined relativity and discovered the photoelectric effect.

Science, democracy, and capitalism remade the world into a place far richer that it had ever been before, richer in material goods, in knowledge, in health, in art, and in ideas.

==When your grandparents were young==

The best way to learn history is to talk to people who are older than you. Many people love to talk about when they were young. When you read about the past in a history book, it can be hard to remember that real people lived through all of those famous events. By talking to someone about their life you can hear what happened in history first hand!

== Introduction ==
It is now time to build on everything that has been established so far.  While it is unlikely that you are going to be using MS-DOS for a major application, it is a good operating system to demonstrate a number of ideas related to software access of the 8250 UART and driver development. Compared to modern operating systems like Linux, OS-X, or Windows, MS-DOS can hardly be called an operating system at all.  All it really offers is basic access to the hard drive and a few minor utilities.  That really doesn't matter so much for what we are dealing with here, and it is a good chance to see how we can directly manipulate the UART to get the full functionality of all aspects of the computer.  The tools I'm using are all available for free (as in beer) and can be used in emulator software (like VMware or Bochs) to try these ideas out as well.  Emulation of serial devices is generally a weak point for these programs, so it may work easier if you work from a floppy boot of DOS, or on an older computer that is otherwise destined for the trash can because it is obsolete.

For Pascal, you can look here:

*Turbo Pascal [http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,20803,00.html] version 5.5 - This is the software I'm actually using for these examples, and the compiler that most older documentation on the web will also support (generally).

*Free Pascal [http://www.freepascal.org/] - *note* this is a 32-bit version, although there is a port for DOS development.  Unlike Turbo Pascal, it also has ongoing development and is more valuable for serious projects running in DOS.

For MS-DOS substitution (if you don't happen to have MS-DOS 6.22 somewhere):

*FreeDOS [http://www.freedos.org/] Project - Now that Microsoft has abandoned development of DOS, this is pretty much the only OS left that is pure command line driven and following the DOS architecture.

== '''Hello World''', Serial Data Version ==

In the [[Programming:Serial Data Communications#Intended Audience|introduction]], I mentioned that it was very difficult to write computer software that implements RS-232 serial communications.  A very short program shows that at least a basic program really isn't that hard at all.  In fact, just three more lines than a typical &quot;Hello World&quot; program.

 program HelloSerial;
 var
   DataFile: Text;
 begin
   Assign(DataFile,'COM1');
   Rewrite(DataFile);
   Writeln(DataFile,'Hello World');
   Close(DataFile);
 end.

All of this works because in DOS (and all version of Windows as well... on this particular point) has a &quot;reserved&quot; file name called COM1 that is the operating system hooks into the serial communications ports.  While this seems simple, it is deceptively simple.  You still don't have access to being able to control the baud rate or any of the other settings for the modem.  That is a fairly simple thing to add, however, using the knowledge of the UART discussed in the previous chapter [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming|Programming the 8250 UART]].

To try something even easier, you don't even need a compiler at all.  This takes advantage of the reserved &quot;device names&quot; in DOS and can be done from the command prompt.

 C:\&gt;COPY CON COM1

What you are doing here is taking input from ''CON'' (the console or the standard keyboard you use on your computer) and it &quot;copies&quot; the data to ''COM1''.  You can also use variations of this to do some interesting file transfers, but it has some important limitations.  Most importantly, you don't have access to the UART settings, and this simply uses whatever the default settings of the UART might be, or what you used last time you changed the settings to become with a serial terminal program.

== Finding the Port I/O Address for the UART ==

The next big task that we have to work with is trying to find the base &quot;address&quot; of the Port I/O so that we can communicate with the UART chip directly (see the part about interface logic in the [[Serial_Programming:Typical_RS232-Hardware_Configuration|Typical RS232-Hardware Configuration]] module for information what this is about).  For a &quot;typical&quot; PC system, the following are usually the addresses that you need to work with:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Serial Port Name !! Base I/O Port Address !! IRQ (interrupt) Number
|-
| COM1 || 3F8 || 4
|-
| COM2 || 2F8 || 3
|-
| COM3 || 3E8 || 4
|-
| COM4 || 2E8 || 3
|}

=== Looking up UART Base Address in RAM ===

We will get back to the issue of the IRQ Number in a little bit, but for now we need to know where to start accessing information about each UART.  As demonstrated previously, DOS also keeps track of where the UART IO ports are located at for its own purpose, so you can try to &quot;look up&quot; within the memory tables that DOS uses to try and find the correct address as well.  This doesn't always work, because we are going outside of the normal DOS API structure.  Alternative operating systems ( FreeDOS works fine here ) that are otherwise compatible with MS-DOS may not work in this manner, so take note that this may simply give you a wrong result altogether.

The addresses for the serial I/O Ports can be found at the following locations in RAM:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Port !! Segment !! Offset
|-
| COM1 || $0040 || $0000
|-
| COM2 || $0040 || $0002
|-
| COM3 || $0040 || $0004
|-
| COM4 || $0040 || $0006
|}


Those addresses are written to memory by the BIOS when it boots. If one of the ports doesn't exist, the BIOS writes zero to the respective address. Note that the addresses are given in segment:offset format and that you have to multiply the address of the segment with 16 and add the offset to get to the physical address in memory.  This is where DOS &quot;finds&quot; the port addresses so you can run the first sample program in this chapter.

In assembler you can get the addresses like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
; Data Segment
.data
Port  dw 0
...

; Code Segment
.code
mov ax,40h
mov es,ax
mov si,0
mov bx,Port ; 0 - COM1 , 1 - COM2 ...
shl bx,1
mov Port, es:[si+bx]
&lt;/pre&gt;

In Turbo Pascal, you can get at these addresses almost the same way and in some ways even easier because it is a &quot;high level language&quot;.  All you have to do is add the following line to access the COM Port location as a simple array:

 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;

The reserved, non standard, word '''absolute''' is a flag to the compiler that instead of &quot;allocating&quot; memory, that you already have a place in mind to have the computer look instead.  This is something that should seldom be done by a programmer unless you are accessing things like these I/O port addresses that are always stored in this memory location.

For a complete program that simply prints out a table of the I/O port addresses for all four standard COM ports, you can use this simple program:

 program UARTLook;
 const
   HexDigits: array [$0..$F] of Char = '0123456789ABCDEF';
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   Index: Integer;
 function HexWord(Number:Word):String;
 begin
   HexWord := '$' + HexDigits[Hi(Number) shr 4] +
                    HexDigits[Hi(Number) and $F] +
                    HexDigits[Lo(Number) shr 4] +
                    HexDigits[Lo(Number) and $F];
 end;
 begin
   writeln('Serial COMport I/O Port addresses:');
   for Index := 1 to 4 do begin
     writeln('COM',Index,' is located at ',HexWord(ComPort[Index]));
   end;
 end.

=== Searching BIOS Setup ===

Assuming that the standard I/O addresses don't seem to be working for your computer and you haven't been able to find the correct I/O Port offset addresses through searching RAM either, all hope is still not lost.  Assuming that you have not accidentally changed these settings earlier, you can also try to look up these numbers in the BIOS setup page for your computer.  It may take some pushing around to find this information, but if you have a conventional serial data port on your computer, it will be there.

If you are using a serial data port that is connected via USB (common on more recent computers), you are simply not going to be (easily) able to do direct serial data communications in DOS.  Instead, you need to use more advanced operating systems like Windows or Linux that is beyond the scope of this chapter.  We will cover how to access the serial communications routines in those operating systems in subsequent chapters.  The basic principles we are discussing here would still be useful to review because it goes into the basic UART structure.

While it may be useful to try and make IRQs selectable and not presume that the information listed above is correct in all situations, it is important to note that most PC-compatible computer equipment usually has these IRQs and I/O port addresses used in this way because of legacy support.  And surprisingly as computers get more sophisticated with even more advanced equipment like USB devices, these legacy connections still work for most equipment.

== Making modifications to UART Registers ==

Now that we know where to look in memory to modify the UART registers, let's put that knowledge to work.  We are also now going to do some practical application of the tables listed earlier in the chapter [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming|8250 UART Programming]].

To start with, let's redo the previous &quot;Hello World&quot; application, but this time we are going to set the RS-232 transmission parameters to 1200 baud, 7 databits, even parity, and 2 stop bits.  I'm choosing this setting parameter because it is not standard for most modem applications, as a demonstration.  If you can change these settings, then other transmission settings are going to be trivial.

First, we need to set up some software constants to keep track of locations in memory.  This is mainly to keep things clear to somebody trying to make changes to our software in the future, not because the compiler needs it.

 const
   LCR = 3;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;

Next, we need to set the DLAB to a logical &quot;1&quot; so we can set the baud rate:

 Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;

In this case, we are ignoring the rest of the settings for the Line Control Register (LCR) because we will be setting them up in a little bit.  Remember this is just a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; way to get this done for now.  A more &quot;formal&quot; way to set up things like baud rate will be demonstrated later on with this module.

Following this, we need to put in the baud rate for the modem.  Looking up 1200 baud on the [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming#Divisor Latch Bytes|Divisor Latch Bytes table]] gives us the following values:

 Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
 Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $60;

Now we need to set the values for the LCR based on our desired setting of 7-2-E for the communication settings.  We also need to &quot;clear&quot; the DLAB which we can also do at the same time.
 
 Clearing DLAB = 0 * 128
 Clearing &quot;Set Break&quot; flag = 0 * 64
 Even Parity = 2 * 8
 Two Stop bits = 1 * 4
 7 Data bits = 2 * 1

 Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $16  {8*2 + 4 + 2 = 22 or $16 in hex}

Are things clear so far?  What we have just done is some bit-wise arithmetic, and I'm trying to keep things very simple here and to try and explain each step in detail.  Let's just put the whole thing together as the quick and dirty &quot;Hello World&quot;, but with adjustment of the transmission settings as well:

 program HelloSerial;
 const
   LCR = 3;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   DataFile: Text;
 begin
   Assign(DataFile,'COM1');
   Rewrite(DataFile);
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $60;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $16
   Writeln(DataFile,'Hello World');
   Close(DataFile);
 end.

This is getting a little more complicated, but not too much.  Still, all we have done so far is just write data out to the serial port.  Reading data from the serial data port is going to be a little bit trickier.

== Basic Serial Input ==

In theory, you could use a standard I/O library and simply read data from the COM port like you would be reading from a file on your hard drive.  Something like this:

 Readln(DataFile,SomeSerialData);

There are some problems with doing that with most software, however.  One thing to keep in mind is that using a standard input routine will stop your software until the input is finished ending with a &quot;Enter&quot; character (ASCII code 13 or in hex $0D).  

Usually what you want to do with a program that receives serial data is to allow the user to do other things while the software is waiting for the data input.  In a multitasking operating system, this would simply be put on another &quot;thread&quot;, but with this being DOS, we don't (usually) have threading capabilities, nor is it necessary.  There are some other alternatives that we do in order to get the serial data brought into your software.

=== Polling the UART ===

Perhaps the easiest to go, besides simply letting the standard I/O routines grab the input) is to do software polling of the UART.  One of the reasons why this works is because serial communications is generally so slow compared to the CPU speed that you can perform many tasks in between each character being transmitted to your computer.  Also, we are trying to do practical applications using the UART chip, so this is a good way to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the chip beyond simple output of data.

==== Serial Echo Program ====

Looking at the Line Status Register (LSR), there is a bit called '''Data Ready''' that indicates there is some data available to your software in the UART.  We are going to take advantage of that bit, and start to do data access directly from the UART instead of relying on the standard I/O library.  This program we are going to demonstrate here is going to be called ''Echo'' because all it does is take whatever data is sent to the computer through the serial data port and display it on your screen.  We are also going to be configuring the RS-232 settings to a more normal 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity.  To quit the program, all you have to do is press any key on your keyboard.

 program SerialEcho;
 uses
   Crt;
 const
   RBR = 0;
   LCR = 3;
   LSR = 5;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   InputLetter: Char;
 begin
   Writeln('Serial Data Terminal Character Echo Program.  Press any key on the keyboard to quit.');
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $0C;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $03;
   {Scan for serial data}
   while not KeyPressed do begin
     if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
       InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
       Write(InputLetter);
     end; {if}
   end; {while}
 end.

==== Simple Terminal ====

This program really isn't that complicated.  In fact, a very simple &quot;terminal&quot; program can be adapted from this to allow both sending and receiving characters.  In this case, the ''Escape'' key will be used to quit the program, which will in fact be where most of the changes to the program will happen.  We are also introducing for the first time direct output into the UART instead of going through the standard I/O libraries with this line:

 Port[ComPort[1] + THR] := Ord(OutputLetter); 

The Transmit Holding Register (THR) is how data you want to transmit gets into the UART in the first place.  DOS just took care of the details earlier, so now we don't need to open a &quot;file&quot; in order to send data.  We are going to assume, to keep things very simple, that you can't type at 9600 baud, or roughly 11,000 words per minute.  Only if you are dealing with very slow baud rates like 110 baud is that going to be an issue anyway (still at over 130 words per minute of typing... a very fast typist indeed).

 program SimpleTerminal;
 uses
   Crt;
 const
   THR = 0;
   RBR = 0;
   LCR = 3;
   LSR = 5;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
   {Character Constants}
   NullLetter = #0;
   EscapeKey = #27;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   InputLetter: Char;
   OutputLetter: Char;
 begin
   Writeln('Simple Serial Data Terminal Program.  Press &quot;Esc&quot; to quit.');
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $0C;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $03;
   {Scan for serial data}
   OutputLetter := NullLetter;
   repeat
     if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
       InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
       Write(InputLetter);
     end; {if}
     if KeyPressed then begin
       OutputLetter := ReadKey;
       Port[ComPort[1] + THR] := Ord(OutputLetter); 
     end; {if}
   until OutputLetter = EscapeKey;
 end.

== Interrupt Drivers in DOS ==

The software polling method may be adequate for most simple tasks, and if you want to test some serial data concepts without writing a lot of software, it may be sufficient.  Quite a bit can be done with just that method of data input.

When you are writing a more complete piece of software, however, it becomes important to worry about the efficiency of your software.  While the computer is &quot;polling&quot; the UART to see if a character has been sent through the serial communications port, it spends quite a few CPU cycles doing absolutely nothing at all.  It also get very difficult to expand a program like the one demonstrated above to become a small section of a very large program.  If you want to get that last little bit of CPU performance out of your software, we need to turn to interrupt drivers and how you can write them.

I'll openly admit that this is a tough leap in complexity from a simple polling application listed above, but it is an important programming topic in general.  We are also going to expose a little bit about the low-level behavior of the 8086 chip family, which is knowledge you can use in newer operating systems as well, at least for background information.

Going back to earlier discussions about the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) chip, external devices like the UART can &quot;signal&quot; the 8086 that an important task needs to occur that '''interrupts''' the flow of the software currently running on the computer.  Not all computers do this, however, and sometimes the software polling of devices is the only way to get data input from other devices.  The real advantage of interrupt events is that you can process data acquisition from devices like the UART very quickly, and CPU time spent trying to test if there is data available can instead be used for other tasks.  It is also useful when designing operating systems that are ''event driven''.

Interrupt Requests (IRQs) are labeled with the names IRQ0 to IRQ15.  UART chips typically use either IRQ 3 or IRQ 4.  When the PIC signals to the CPU that an interrupt has occurred, the CPU automatically start to run a very small subroutine that has been previously setup in the '''Interrupt Table''' in RAM.  The exact routine that is started depends on which IRQ has been triggered.  What we are going to demonstrate here is the ability to write our own software that &quot;takes over&quot; from the operating system what should occur when the interrupt occurs.  In effect, writing our own &quot;operating system&quot; instead, at least for those parts we are rewriting.

Indeed, this is exactly what operating system authors do when they try to make a new OS... deal with the interrupts and write the subroutines necessary to control the devices connected to the computer.

The following is a very simple program that captures the keyboard interrupt and produces a &quot;clicking&quot; sound in the speaker as you type each key.  One interesting thing about this whole section, while it is moving slightly off topic, this is communicating with a serial device.  The keyboard on a typical PC transmits the information about each key that you press through a RS-232 serial protocol that operates usually between 300 and 1200 baud and has its own custom UART chip.  Normally this isn't something you are going to address, and seldom are you going to have another kind of device connected to the keyboard port, but it is interesting that you can &quot;hack&quot; into the functions of your keyboard by understanding serial data programming.

 program KeyboardDemo;
 uses
   Dos, Crt;
 const
   EscapeKey = #27;
 var
   OldKeybrdVector: Procedure;
 {$F+}
 procedure Keyclick; interrupt;
 begin
   if Port[$60] &lt; $80 then begin
     Sound(5000);
     Delay(1);
     Nosound;
   end;
   inline($9C) { PUSHF - Push the flags onto the stack }
   OldKeybrdVector;
 end;
 {$F-}
 begin
   GetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);
   SetIntVec($9,Addr(Keyclick));
   repeat
    if KeyPressed then begin
      OutputLetter := ReadKey;
      Write(OutputLetter);
    end; {if}
   until OutputLetter = EscapeKey;
   SetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);
 end.

There are a number of things that this program does, and we need to explore the realm of 16-bit DOS software as well.  The 8086 chip designers had to make quite a few compromises in order to work with the computer technology that was available at the time it was designed.  Computer memory was quite expensive compared to the overall cost of the computer.  Most of the early microcomputers that the IBM-PC was competing against only had 64K or 128K of main CPU RAM anyway, so huge programs were not considered important.  In fact, the original IBM-PC was designed to operate on only 128K of RAM although it did become standard with generally up to 640K of main RAM, especially by the time the IBM PC-XT was released and the market for PC &quot;clones&quot; turned out what is generally considered the &quot;standard PC&quot; computer today.

The design came up with what is called '''segmented memory''', where the CPU address is made up of a memory &quot;segment&quot; pointer and a 64K block of memory.  That is why some early software on these computers could only run in 64K of memory, and created nightmares for compiler authors on the 8086.  Pentium computers don't generally have this issue, as the memory model in &quot;protected mode&quot; doesn't use this segmented design methodology.

=== Far Procedure Calls ===
 
 {$F+}
 {$F-}

This program has two &quot;compiler switches&quot; that inform the compiler of the need to use what are called far procedure calls.  Normally for small programs and simple subroutines, you are able to use what is called relative indexing with the software so the CPU &quot;jumps&quot; to the portion of RAM with the procedure by doing a bit of simple math and &quot;adding&quot; a number to the current CPU address in order to find the correct instructions.  This is done especially because it uses quite a bit less memory to store all of these instructions.

Sometimes, however, a procedure must be accessed from somewhere in RAM that is quite different from the current CPU memory address &quot;instruction pointer&quot;.  Interrupt procedures are one of these, because it doesn't even have to be the same program that is stored in the interrupt vector table.  That brings up the next part to discuss:

=== Interrupt Procedures ===

 procedure Keyclick; interrupt;

The word &quot;interrupt&quot; after this procedure name is a key item here.  This tells the compiler that it must do something a little bit different when organizing this function than how a normal function call behaves.  Typically for most software on the computer, you have a bunch of simple instructions that are then followed by (in assembler) an instruction called:

 RET

This is the mnemonic assembly instruction for return from procedure call.  Interrupts are handled a little bit differently and should normally end with a different CPU instruction that in assembly is called:

 IRET

or Interrupt return for short.  One of the things that should also happen with any interrupt service routine is to &quot;preserve&quot; the CPU information before doing anything else.  Each &quot;command&quot; that you write in your software will modify the internal registers of the CPU.  Keep in mind that an interrupt can occur right in the middle of doing some calculations for another program, like rendering a graphic image or making payroll calculations.  We need to hand onto that information and &quot;restore&quot; those values on all of the CPU registers at the end of our subroutine.  This is usually done by &quot;pushing&quot; all of the register values onto the CPU stack, performing the ISR, and then restoring the CPU registers afterward.

In this case, Turbo Pascal (and other well-written compilers having a compiler flag like this) takes care of these low-level details for you with this simple flag.  If the compiler you are using doesn't have this feature, you will have to add these features &quot;by hand&quot; and explicitly put them into your software.  That doesn't mean the compiler will do everything for you to make an interrupt procedure.  There are more steps to getting this to work still.

=== Procedure Variables ===

 var
   OldKeybrdVector: Procedure;

These instructions are using what is called a procedure variable.  Keep in mind that all software is located in the same memory as variables and other information your software is using.  Essentially, a variable procedure where you don't need to worry about what it does until the software is running, and you can change this variable while your program is running.  This is a powerful concept that is not often used, but it can be used for a number of different things.  In this case we are keeping track of the previous interrupt service routine and &quot;chaining&quot; these routines together.

There are programs called Terminate and Stay Resident (TSRs) that are loaded into your computer.  Some of these are called drivers, and the operating system itself also puts in subroutines to do basic functions.  If you want to &quot;play nice&quot; with all of this other software, the established protocol for making sure everybody gets a chance to review the data in an interrupt is to link each new interrupt subroutine to the previously stored interrupt vector.  When we are done with whatever we want to do with the interrupt, we then let all of the other programs get a chance to used the interrupt as well.  It is also possible that the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) that we just wrote is not the first one in the chain, but instead one that is being called by another ISR.

=== Getting/Setting Interrupt Vectors ===

  GetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);
  SetIntVec($9,Addr(Keyclick));
  SetIntVec($9,@OldKeybrdVector);

Again, this is Turbo Pascal &quot;hiding&quot; the details in a convenient way.  There is a &quot;vector table&quot; that you can directly access, but this vector table is not always in the same location in RAM.  If instead you go through the BIOS with a software interrupt, you are &quot;guaranteed&quot; that the interrupt vector will be correctly replaced.

=== Hardware Interrupt Table ===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

|}

This table gives you a quick glance at some of the things that interrupts are used for, and the interrupt numbers associated with them.  Keep in mind that the IRQ numbers are mainly reference numbers, and that the CPU uses a different set of numbers.  The keyboard IRQ, for example, is IRQ1, but it is numbered as interrupt $09 inside the CPU.

There are also several interrupts that are &quot;generated&quot; by the CPU itself.  While technically hardware interrupts, these are generated by conditions ''within'' the CPU, sometimes based on conditions setup by your software or the operating system.  When we start writing the interrupt service routine for the serial communication ports, we will be using interrupts 11 and 12 ($0B and $0C in hex).  As can be seen, most interrupts are assigned for specific tasks.  I've omitted the software interrupts mainly to keep this on topic regarding serial programming and hardware interrupts.

=== Other features ===

There are several other parts to this program that don't need too much more explanation.  Remember, we are talking about serial programming, not interrupt drivers.  I/O Port $60 is interesting as this is the Receiver Buffer (RBR) for the keyboard UART.  This returns the keyboard &quot;scan code&quot;, not the actual character pressed.  In fact, when you use a keyboard on a PC, the keyboard actually transmits two characters for each key that you use.  One character is transmitted when you press the key down, and another character when the key is &quot;released&quot; to go back up.  In this case, the interrupt service routine in DOS normally converts the scan codes into ASCII codes that your software can use.  In fact, simple keys like the shift key are treated as just another scan code.

The sound routines access the internal PC speaker, not something on a sound card.  About the only thing that uses this speaker any more is the BIOS &quot;beep codes&quot; that you hear only when there is a hardware failure to your computer, or the quick &quot;beep&quot; when you start or reboot the computer.  It was never designed for doing things like speech synthesis or music playback, and driver attempts to use it for those purposes sound awful.  Still, it is something neat to experiment with and a legacy computer part that is surprisingly still used on many current computers..

== Terminal Program Revisited ==

I'm going to go back to the serial terminal program for a bit and this time redo the application by using an interrupt service routine.  There are a few other concepts I'd like to introduce as well so I'll try to put them in with this example program.  From the user perspective, I would like to add the ability to change the terminal characteristics from the command line and allow an &quot;end-user&quot; the ability to change things like the baud rate, stop bits, and parity checking, and allow these to be variables instead of hard-coded constants.  I'll explain each section and then put it all together when we are through.

=== Serial ISR ===

This is an example of a serial ISR we can use:

 {$F+}
 procedure SerialDataIn; interrupt;
 var
  InputLetter: Char;
 begin     
   if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
     InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
  end; {if}
 end;
 {$F-}

This isn't that much different from the polling method that we used earlier, but keep in mind that by placing the checking inside an ISR that the CPU is only doing the check when there is a piece of data available.  Why even check the LSR to see if there is a data byte available?  Reading data sent to the UART is not the only reason why the UART will invoke an interrupt.  We will go over that in detail in a later section, but for now this is good programming practice as well, to confirm that the data is in there.

By moving this checking to the ISR, more CPU time is available for performing other tasks.  We could even put the keyboard polling into an ISR as well, but we are going to keep things very simple for now.

=== FIFO disabling ===

There is one minor problem with the way we have written this ISR.  We are assuming that there is no FIFO in the UART.  The &quot;bug&quot; that could happen with this ISR as it is currently written is that multiple characters can be in the FIFO buffer.  Normally when this happens, the UART only sends a single interrupt, and it is up to the ISR to &quot;empty&quot; the FIFO buffer completely.

Instead, all we are going to do is simply disable the FIFO completely.  This can be done using the FCR (FIFO Control Register) and explicitly disabling the FIFO.  As an added precaution, we are also going to &quot;clear&quot; the FIFO buffers in the UART as a part of the initialization portion of the program.  Clearing the FIFOs look like this:

  Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $07; {clearing the FIFOs}

Disabling the FIFOs look like this:

  Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $00; {disabling FIFOs}

We will be using the FIFOs in the next section, so this is more a brief introduction to this register so far.

=== Working with the PIC ===

Up until this point, we didn't have to worry about working with the Programmable Interrupt Controller (the PIC).  Now we need to.  There isn't the need to do all of the potential instructions for the PIC, but we do need to enable and disable the interrupts that are used by the UART.  There are two PICs typically on each PC, but due to the typical UART IRQ vector, we really only have to deal with the master PIC.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Pic Function !! I/O Port Address
|-
| PIC Commands || 0x20
|-
| Interrupt Flags || 0x21
|}

This adds the following two constants into the software:

 {PIC Constants}
 MasterPIC = $20;
 MasterOCW1 = $21;

After consulting the [[Serial Programming:8250 UART Programming#PIC Device Masking|PIC IRQ table]] we need to add the following line to the software in order to enable IRQ4 (used for COM1 typically):

 Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] and $EF;

When we do the &quot;cleanup&quot; when the program finishes, we also need to disable this IRQ as well with this line of software:

 Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] or $10;

Remember that COM2 is on another IRQ vector, so you will have to use different constants for that IRQ.  That will be demonstrated a little bit later.  We are using a logical and/or with the existing value in this PIC register because we don't want to change the values for the other interrupt vectors that other software and drivers may be using on your PC.

We also need to modify the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) a little bit to work with the PIC.  There is a command you can send to the PIC that is simply called End of Interrupt (EOI).  This signals to the PIC that it can clear this interrupt signal and process lower-priority interrupts.  If you fail to clear the PIC, the interrupt signal will remain and none of the other interrupts that are &quot;lower priority&quot; can be processed by the CPU.  This is how the CPU communicates back to the PIC to end the interrupt cycle.

The following line is added to the ISR to make this happen:

 Port[MasterPIC] := EOI;

=== Modem Control Register ===

This is perhaps the most non-obvious little mistake you can make when trying to get the UART interrupt.  The Modem Control register is really the way for the UART to communicate to the rest of the PC.  Because of the way the circuitry on the motherboards of most computers is designed, you usually have to turn on the Auxiliary Output 2 signal in order for interrupts to &quot;connect&quot; to the CPU.  In addition, here we are going to turn on the RTS and DTS signals on the [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Connections|serial data cable]] to make sure the equipment is going to transmit.  We will cover software and hardware flow control in a later section.

To turn on these values in the MCR, we need to add the following line in the software:

 Port[ComPort[1] + MCR] := $0B;

=== Interrupt Enable Register ===

We are still not home free yet.  We still need to enable interrupts on the UART itself.  This is very simple, and for now all we want to trigger an interrupt from the UART is just when data is received by the UART.  This is a very simple line to add here:

 Port[ComPort[1] + IER] := $01;

=== Putting this together so far ===

Here is the complete program using ISR input:

&lt;pre&gt;
 program ISRTerminal;
 uses
   Crt, Dos;
 const
   {UART Constants}
   THR = 0;
   RBR = 0;
   IER = 1;
   FCR = 2;
   LCR = 3;
   MCR = 4;
   LSR = 5;
   Latch_Low = $00;
   Latch_High = $01;
   {PIC Constants}
   MasterPIC = $20;
   MasterOCW1 = $21;
   {Character Constants}
   NullLetter = #0;
   EscapeKey = #27;
 var
   ComPort: array [1..4] of Word absolute $0040:$0000;
   OldSerialVector: procedure;
   OutputLetter: Char;
 {$F+}
 procedure SerialDataIn; interrupt;
 var
   InputLetter: Char;
 begin     
   if (Port[ComPort[1] + LSR] and $01) &gt; 0 then begin
     InputLetter := Chr(Port[ComPort[1] + RBR]);
     Write(InputLetter);
   end; {if}
   Port[MasterPIC] := EOI;
 end;
 {$F-}
 begin
   Writeln('Simple Serial ISR Data Terminal Program.  Press &quot;Esc&quot; to quit.');
   {Change UART Settings}
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $80;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_High] := $00;
   Port[ComPort[1] + Latch_Low] := $0C;
   Port[ComPort[1] + LCR] := $03;
   Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $07; {clearing the FIFOs}
   Port[ComPort[1] + FCR] := $00; {disabling FIFOs}
   Port[ComPort[1] + MCR] := $0B;
   {Setup ISR vectors}
   GetIntVec($0C,@OldSerialVector);
   SetIntVec($0C,Addr(SerialDataIn));
   Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] and $EF;
   Port[ComPort[1] + IER] := $01;
   {Scan for keyboard data}
   OutputLetter := NullLetter;
   repeat
     if KeyPressed then begin
       OutputLetter := ReadKey;
       Port[ComPort[1] + THR] := Ord(OutputLetter); 
     end; {if}
   until OutputLetter = EscapeKey;
   {Put the old ISR vector back in}
   SetIntVec($0C,@OldSerialVector);
   Port[MasterOCW1] := Port[MasterOCW1] or $10;
 end.
&lt;/pre&gt;

At this point you start to grasp how complex serial data programming can get.  We are not finished yet, but if you have made it this far you hopefully understand each part of the program listed above.  We are going to try and stay with this one step at a time, but at this point you should be able to write some simple custom software that uses serial I/O.

=== Command Line Input ===

There are a number of different ways that you can &quot;scan&quot; the parameters that start the program.  For example, if you start a simple terminal program in DOS, you can use this command to begin:

 C:&gt; terminal COM1 9600 8 1 None

or perhaps

 C:&gt; terminal COM4 1200 7 2 Even

Obviously there should not be a need to have the end-user recompile the software if they want to change something simple like the baud rate.  What we are trying to accomplish here is to grab those other items that were used to start the program.  In Turbo Pascal, there is function that returns a string

 ParamStr(index)

which contains each item of the command line.  These are passed to the program through strings.  A quick sample program on how to extract these parameters can be found here:

 program ParamTst;
 var
   Index: Integer;
 begin
   writeln('Parameter Test -- displays all command line parameters of this program');
   writeln('Parameter Count = ',ParamCount);
   for Index := 0 to ParamCount do begin
     writeln('Param # ',Index,' - ',ParamStr(Index));
   end;
 end.

One interesting &quot;parameter&quot; is parameter number 0, which is the name of the program that is processing the commands.  We will not be using this parameter, but it is something useful in many other programming situations.

=== Grabbing Terminal Parameters ===

For the sake of simplicity, we are going to require that either all of the parameters are going to be in that format of baud rate, bit size, stop bits, parity; or there will be no parameters at all.  This example is going to be mainly to demonstrate how to use variables to change the settings of the UART by the software user rather than the programmer.  Since the added sections are self-explanatory, I'm just going to give you the complete program.  There will be some string manipulation going on here that is beyond the scope of this book, but that is going to be used only for parsing the commands.  To keep the user interface simple, we are using the command line arguments alone for changing the UART parameters.  We could build a fancy interface to allow these settings to be changed while the program is running, but that is an exercise that is left to the reader.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Family Sponsorship program is designed to allow Canadians to bring members of their family or significant others into the Country. The focus on this application is to prove that the relationship is of an acceptable type and is genuine. 

==Sponsorship Types==
There are several types Family sponsorships. A person may sponsor any of the following people:
* spouse&lt;ref&gt;any marriage recognized by Canadian law&lt;/ref&gt;, common-law partner&lt;ref&gt;must be cohabitating in a conjugal relationship for at least one year&lt;/ref&gt; or conjugal partner&lt;ref&gt;conjugal relationship for over one year with a foriegn national outside of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;.
* parents or grandparents
* dependent children including adopted
* other children who are under the sponsor's guardianship
* orphaned brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, or grandchildren &lt;ref&gt;must be under 18 and not married or in a conjugal relationship&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependent Children===
Dependent chilren means any child who is either:
* under 22 years, unmarried on the date the application is submitted and is unmarried on date the child lands in Canada; 
* financially dependent on parents due to enrollment and attendance in a full-time educational institution since the age of 22 or since the date of marriage, if married under 22; or
* dependant due to mental or physical disability.

Any interruption in full-time studies for under a year in total will not affect dependant status.

==Eligibility==
Requirements for sponsor:
* over 18 years old
* Permanent Resident or Canadian Citizen
* live in Canada
* income above &quot;Low Income Cut-off&quot; level.&lt;ref&gt;does not apply for sponsoring spouse&lt;/ref&gt;
* not on social assistance except for disability
* not in default on a previous sponsorship
* no in prison 
* not an undischarged bankrupt
* not under a deportation order

The application for this visa is made to a visa office outside of Canada. The applicant for a Parents and Grandparents Super Visa must meet certain criteria.

Firstly, the applicant must me eligible for a regular visitor visa. This means that besides being in good health and having a valid travel document, the applicant must satisfy a Canadian immigration official that they will willingly leave the country at the end of their authorized stay, that they have sufficient ties to their home country such as a job, family or property, and that they have sufficient funds available to support themselves for the length of their stay.[http://www.immigration.ca/en/parent-grandparent-super-visa.html Parent and Grandparents Super Visa ]

==Sponsor's Responsibilities==
Sponsoring is a major committment. For a period of 3 to 10 years, the sponsor is required to, among other things:
* provide the Applicant with basic living requirements and ''essential needs'' where the applicant cannot do so for his or herself.&lt;ref&gt;this includes health, eye care, dental, food, clothing shelter&lt;/ref&gt;
* ensure that Applicant does not have to apply for social assistance

Once the sponsorship has begun it '''cannot be cancelled''' in cases of divorce, separation, or relathionship breakdown. 

===Minimum Threshold income===
The Sponsor must have a minimum income, known as the &quot;Low Income Cut-Off&quot; ''except'' where it is a spousal sponsorship. 

* [http://www.canadavisa.com/documents/cutoff.htm Cut-Off amounts]

===Co-signer===
A co-signer may be used when sponsoring a non-spouse in order to reach the Minimum Income requirement. The co-signer ''must'' be a spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner.

==Process==

=== Forms ===
Two sets of forms are needed, those relating to the sponsorship and the standard Permanent Residency forms.

===Documents===
The Sponsor must provide several documents. 

1)  A photocopy of ''one'' of the following:
* Record of Landing 
* Permanent Resident Card (both sides)
* Canadian Citizenship Card (both sides)
* Canadian Birth certificate
* Canadian passport

2) ''One'' of the following:
* An '''Option-C''' tax print out. One can be obtained from a local Revenue Canada Office.
* proof of income.

3) ''original'' '''letter of employment'''.

'''if there is a co-signer'''
* photocopy of '''marriage certificate'''

'''if divorced'''
* photocopy of '''divorce certificate''' 

'''if Applicant is a parent'''
* photocopy of '''birth certificate'''

'''if Sponsoring an adopted child'''
* photocopy of '''adoption order'''

===Inside/Outside Canada===
There are two modes of applying under the family class. A Applicant can be sponsored from inside Canada or from outside Canada. There are separate application Guides for each steam. The big difference between the two is that applications ''inside Canada'' '''cannot be appealed''' if refused. Also, the location and speed at which the application is processed is different, and the method of payment is different. Applications inside Canada can be paid online or with a CIC bank reciept. Applications outside of Canada can be paid online or with an international money order.

===Mailing===
The completed applications of the Sponsor and Applicant the documents, and the payment reciept should be sent to the processing center.&lt;ref&gt; Inside Canada: Vegreville&lt;Br&gt;outside Canada: Missisauga &lt;/ref&gt;

If family status changes, such as marriage, divorce, birth, death, contact address or number, either the sponsor or applicant must call the processing center to inform them of the changes.

==Processing Times==
* [http://www.canadavisa.com/family-class-immigration-processing-times.htm processing times]

==Fees==
There are two types of fees, the Processing Fee and Permanent Residence Fee. Only the Processing Fee needs to be paid immediately, however, both fees may be paid at once.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=825
|- bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;

|-
|$475 &lt;br&gt;or $75 (if under 22 yrs)

|Accompanying family members
|-
|
|bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;| '''Permanent Resident Fees''' (paid upon acceptance)
|-

|}

So, for example. a sponsorship of a spouse over 22 years will be $550 for processing and $490 for the PR fees for a total of $1040.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nahuatl (pronounced in two syllables, NA-watl ['na.watɬ]) is a term applied to some members of the Aztecan or Nahuan sub-branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. The languages called &quot;Nahuatl&quot; are all Native American languages indigenous to central Mexico.

An example of a largely semasiological text, that holds meaning and can be read, but which does not represent [[phoneme]]s of the actual spoken language.]]

Often the term &quot;Nahuatl&quot; is used specifically with reference to the language called Classical Nahuatl, which was the language of the Aztec Empire and therefore used as a lingua franca in much of Mesoamerica during the 7th century AD through the late 16th century, at which time its prominence and influence was interrupted by the Spanish conquest of the New World. Though it should be pointed out that Nahuatl influence increased slightly for some time before decreasing. The Spaniards used Nahuatl to strengthen their influence over the conquesy territories and to spread Christianity; it was even used in places it had not previously been spoken. This was also done (though maybe not exactly the same way) for the Quechua in South America. It was when the colonies started to gain independence that the Spanish-speaking leaders (mainly &quot;criollos&quot;) made Spanish the predominant language.

The term &quot;Nahuatl&quot; also serves to identify a number of modern Nahuatl dialects (linguistic variants, some of them mutually unintelligible) that are still spoken by at least 1.5 million people in what is now Mexico. All of these dialects show influence from the Spanish language to various degrees, some of them much more than others. No modern dialects are identical with Classical Nahuatl, but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to Classical Nahuatl than peripheral ones.

Nahuatl is still the most widely spoken group of Native American languages in Mexico

Nahuatl (nāhuatl/nawatlahtolli)

Nahuatl is an Uto-Aztecan language spoken by about 1.5 million people in Mexico. The majority of speakers live in central Mexico, particularly in Puebla, Veracruz, Hildago, San Luis Potosi, Guerrero, Mexico (state), El Distrito Federal, Tlaxcala, Morelos and Oaxaca, and also in El Salvador. There are smaller numbers of Nahuatl speakers throughout the rest of Mexico, and in parts of the USA.

There are numerous dialects of Nahuatl, some of which are mutually unintelligible. Most Nahuatl speakers also speak Spanish, with the exception of some of most elderly.

Classical Nahuatl was the language of the Aztec empire and was used as a lingua franca in much of Mesoamerica from the 7th century AD until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The modern dialects of Nahuatl spoken in the Valley of Mexico are closest to Classical Nahuatl.

Nahuatl was originally written with a pictographic script which was not a full writing system but instead served as a mnemonic to remind readers of texts they had learnt orally. The script appeared in inscriptions carved in stone and in picture books, many of which the Spanish destroyed.

The Spanish introduced the Latin alphabet to write Nahuatl, and a large amount of prose and poetry was subsequently written. Every since there has been considerable debate about how to spell Nahuatl.

In mathematics, a rational number is a real number that can be written as the ratio of two integers, i.e., it is of the form 
:''a''/''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' is not zero. An '''irrational number''' is a number that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers, i.e., it is not of the form 
:''a''/''b'' . 


== History of the theory of irrational numbers ==

The discovery of irrational numbers is usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum, who produced a proof of the irrationality of the &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction (proof below). However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but his beliefs would not accept the existence of irrational numbers and so he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning.
As you see, mathematics might be dangerous.

== Irrationality of the square root of 2 ==

In this section we attempt to explain why &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.  Irrational is a fancy word for a number that cannot be written as a fraction where the top and bottom of the fraction are whole numbers.  At one point in time it was once believed that every number could be written as a fraction.  

Before we start the proof we first should recall a few familiar facts.  First, is that when we write fractions we can always ''reduce'' them so they have no common factors.
Just to remind ourselves how this goes, let's think about the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{15}{21}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since 3 divides into 15 evenly, and 3 divides into 21 evenly, then we can make this fraction have a smaller numerator and denominator.  In this example see this by the following calculation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{15}{21}=\frac{3\cdot 5}{3\cdot 7}=\frac{3}{3}\cdot\frac{5}{7}=1\cdot \frac{5}{7}=\frac{5}{7}&lt;/math&gt;.

The exact same calculation will let us get rid of any number that divides both the numerator and denominator.  Imagine we have a fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; and there is a number ''r'' so that ''r'' divides evenly into ''p'', and ''r'' divides evenly into ''q''.  We can then write &lt;math&gt;p=r\cdot a&lt;/math&gt; (just like we wrote &lt;math&gt;15=3\cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;).  We can also write &lt;math&gt;q=r\cdot b&lt;/math&gt;. Then the calculation looks like:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}=\frac{r\cdot a}{r\cdot b}=\frac{r}{r}\cdot\frac{a}{b}=1\cdot \frac{a}{b}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;.
So whenever we have a fraction where the numerator and denominator are numbers we don't know yet (so we need to use letters like ''p'' and ''q''), we can assume we have already gotten rid of all the numbers that divide both ''p'' and ''q''.

The other thing that we need to remember is our facts about even and odd numbers.  First every even number is really 2 times some smaller number.  This is easy to see if you list out the even numbers:
:{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 |-
 | even number
 | 2 
 | 4 
 | 6 
 | 8 
 | 10
 | 12
 | 14
 | 16
 | 18
 | 20 
 | …
 |-
 | the same even number &lt;br&gt;as 2&amp;middot;&quot;something&quot;
 | 2&amp;middot;1 
 | 2&amp;middot;2
 | 2&amp;middot;3
 | 2&amp;middot;4
 | 2&amp;middot;5
 | 2&amp;middot;6
 | 2&amp;middot;7 
 | 2&amp;middot;8 
 | 2&amp;middot;9
 | 2&amp;middot;10
 | …
|}

Finally we need to remember that the product of two even numbers is again and even number, and the product of two odd numbers is again an odd number.  In fact this is just the familiar rules:
*&quot;even times even is even&quot;
*&quot;odd times odd is odd&quot;
*&quot;even times odd is even&quot;


Now we can start thinking about the proof. The proof is a &quot;proof by contradiction&quot;.  For us this means we will start by assuming &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a fraction.  We will try to investigate and see what this means for the fraction, being careful that every step follows from the last step by something we know to be true.  At the last step we will contradict ourselves.  This will mean that we had to make a mistake somewhere.  Since we were careful about all of the steps, the only possible place for a mistake will be that we assumed &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a fraction.

# Assume that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a fraction. This means &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;. We will assume that this fraction is reduced, so no number could divide both ''a'' and ''b''.  Specifically 2 cannot divide both ''a'' and ''b''.  
# We now square both sides of your equation, that is we write &lt;math&gt;2=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
# By multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that &lt;math&gt;a^2=2\cdot b^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
# Therefore &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; is even, because it is equal to &lt;math&gt;2\cdot b^2&lt;/math&gt; which is even.
# If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; were odd, then &lt;math&gt;a^2=a\cdot a&lt;/math&gt; would be odd, because &quot;an odd times an odd is odd&quot;.  So, it follows that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; must be even.
# Because &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is even, and every even number is 2 times something, we can write &lt;math&gt;a = 2\cdot k&lt;/math&gt;, for some whole number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
# If we substitute &lt;math&gt;2\cdot k&lt;/math&gt; in for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the equation in line 3, we get &lt;math&gt;(2\cdot k)^2 = 2\cdot b^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Now &lt;math&gt;(2\cdot k)^2=(2\cdot k)\cdot(2\cdot k)=4\cdot k^2&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;4\cdot k^2=2\cdot b^2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Because &lt;math&gt;2\cdot k^2&lt;/math&gt; is even then &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; is also even.  Just like we saw with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in line 5, this means that ''b'' is even.
# In line 5 we saw that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; was even and so 2 divides &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  In line 8 we saw that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; was even, so 2 divides &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  But in line 1 we said that 2 cannot divide both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  This is a contradiction.

Since we have found a contradiction, the assumption in line 1 must be false.  That is, it must be false that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are whole numbers.  So we cannot write &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; has a fraction.  The fancy way of saying this is to say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) sets out the provisions for access, use, disclosure, interception and privacy protections of electronic communications. The law was enacted in 1986 and covers various forms of wire and electronic communications.  The [[../SCA| Stored Communications Act]] is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and is discussed separately.  

Two federal statutes govern real-time electronic surveillance in federal criminal investigations. The first and most important is the wiretap statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522, first passed as Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (and generally known as &quot;Title III&quot;). The second statute is the Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices chapter of Title 18 (&quot;the Pen/Trap statute&quot;), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127, which governs pen registers and trap and trace devices.

Title III and the Pen/Trap statute coexist because they regulate access to different types of information. Title III permits the government to obtain the contents of wire and electronic communications in transmission. In contrast, the Pen/Trap statute concerns the real-time collection of addressing and other non-content information relating to those communications. See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(h)(i) (stating that it is not a violation of Title III to use a pen register or trap and trace device); United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC, 227 F.3d 450, 454 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Brown v. Waddell, 50 F.3d 285, 289-94 (4th Cir. 1995) (distinguishing pen registers from Title III intercept devices).

#To perform the work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works;
#To display the copyrighted work publicly, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and
#In the case of sound recordings, to perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.

In addition, certain authors of works of visual art have the rights of attribution and integrity as described in section 106A of the 1976 Copyright Act.

==WHO CAN CLAIM COPYRIGHT==

Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created in fixed form. The copyright in the work of authorship immediately becomes the property of the author who created the work. Only the author or those deriving their rights through the author can rightfully claim copyright.

In the case of works made for hire, the employer and not the employee is considered to be the author.

==WHAT WORKS ARE PROTECTED?==

Copyright protects &quot;original works of authorship&quot; that are fixed in a tangible form of expression. The fixation need not be directly perceptible so long as it may be communicated with the aid of a machine or device. Copyrightable works include the following categories:

#literary works;
#musical works, including any accompanying words
#dramatic works, including any accompanying music
#pantomimes and choreographic works
#pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works
#motion pictures and other audiovisual works
#sound recordings
#architectural works

These categories should be viewed broadly. For example, computer programs and most &quot;compilations&quot; may be registered as &quot;literary works&quot;; maps and architectural plans may be registered as &quot;pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.&quot;

==WHAT IS NOT PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT?==

Several categories of material are generally not eligible for federal copyright protection. These include among others:

Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded)

Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents

Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a description, explanation, or illustration

Works consisting entirely of information that is common property and containing no original authorship (for example: standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, signed into law on October 28, 1998, amended the copyright law to provide limitations for service provider liability relating to material online. New subsection 512(c) of the copyright law provides limitations on service provider liability with respect to information residing, at direction of a user, on a system or network that the service provider controls or operates, if the service provider has designated an agent for notification of claimed infringement by providing contact information to the Copyright Office and through the service provider’s publicly accessible website. 

For purposes of section 512(c), a &quot;service provider&quot; is defined as a provider of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefor, including an entity offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)is the most complete attempt so far to bring standardization to the law of computer information transactions.  In July, 1999, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws “NCCUSL”, after 10 years of work, approved the UCITA provisions and recommended that UCITA be enacted in all 50 states.  


In the past, the American Law Institute “ALI” had worked with NCCUSL to study and draft new uniform state laws, however in the case of UCITA, ALI pulled out of the project because of concerns about the proposed act’s scope and its overall coherence and clarity as well as its treatment of customer rights.  In fact ALI members had called for “fundamental revisions” to the proposed Act.


Prior to UCITA, and in states where it or other laws have not been adopted, the Uniform Commercial Code &quot;UCC&quot;, still governs software sales.  The UCC was developed in the 1940s and 1950s to standardize laws for the sale of goods across the U.S.


States must vote whether or not to adopt UCITA without change, with change or not at all.  Two states have adopted UCITA with some modifications; the first was Maryland in 2000 and the second, Virginia in 2001.  In subsequent years, not one other state has adopted UCITA. In fact four states have passed anti-UCITA laws (Iowa, North Carolina, West Virginia and Vermont).  Massachusetts may be the next to pass what has come to be known as “bomb-shelter” legislation, preventing vendors from applying UCITA laws within the state.


UCITA is a proposed uniform law that would create new rules for software licensing, online access and other transactions in computer information. UCITA was originally a joint project of the American Law Institute (ALI) and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Both organizations have withdrawn support.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Luminosity is a measure of energy flux. This is the rate of flow of energy per unit area per unit time from the surface of the body. Luminosity depends both on the temperature of the body and the size of the body. We assume that a body like the Sun emits radiation effectively as a black body. This means it can be modelled using Stefan-Boltzmann's Law.

''L &amp;prop; R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which gives us ''L'' = 4&amp;pi;''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;sigma;T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Where ''T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 5777 K and Stefan-Boltzmann constant: σ = 5.670400 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W·m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;
What is the Solar luminosity at the surface of the Sun?

Radius of Sun: ''R&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 6.96 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;br&gt;

''L'' = 4 &amp;times; &amp;pi; &amp;times; (6.96 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 5.670400 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W·m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times; (5777 K)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.85 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Secondary liability can consist of contributory or vicarious liability. 

'''Contributory Infringement'''  - a person with knowledge of the infringing activity induces causes or materially contributes to the conduct of another to infringe.  

'''Vicarious Liability''' - a person or entity has the right and ability to control the activities of the person directly infringing and receives financial benefit from those activities – even if the entity or person is unaware of the activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Operators==
[[w:Programming languages|Programming languages]] have a set of operators that perform arithmetical operations, and others such as Boolean operations on truth values, and string operators manipulating [[w:literal string|strings of text]]. Computers are mathematical devices, but [[w:compiler|compiler]]s and [[w:interpreter|interpreter]]s require a full syntactic theory of all operations in order to parse formulae involving any combinations correctly. In particular they depend on [[w:operator precedence|operator precedence]] rules, on [[w:order of operations|order of operations]], that are tacitly assumed in mathematical writing.

Conventionally, the computing usage of '''''operator''''' also goes beyond the [[w:operator|mathematical usage]] (for functions). In [[w:Visual_basic_.net|Visual Basic.NET]], &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;New&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;AddressOf&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;CType&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/font&gt; are operators. You can also define your own uses for operators. When an operator is alphanumeric rather than a punctuation character, it is sometimes called a ''named operator''.

So operators are special symbols that are used to represent for example simple computations like addition and multiplication. Most of the operators in VB.NET do exactly what you would expect them to do, because they are common mathematical symbols. For example, the operator for adding two integers is +.

== Basic Functions ==

Often times, complex signals can be simplified as linear combinations of certain basic functions (a key concept in Fourier analysis).  These basic functions, which are useful to the field of engineering, receive little or no coverage in traditional mathematics classes. These functions will be described here, and studied more in the following chapters.

== Unit Step Function ==

The unit step function and the impulse function are considered to be fundamental functions in engineering, and it is strongly recommended that the reader becomes very familiar with both of these functions.

[[image:Unit Step function u(t) - SST - 08DEC05.png|frame|Unit Step Function]][[Image:Unit_Step_function_u%28t-to%29_-_SST_-_08DEC05.png|frame|Shifted Unit Step function]]
The unit step function, also known as the [[w:Heaviside step function|Heaviside function]], is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \left\{ 
               \begin{matrix} 
                 0, &amp; \mbox{if }t &lt; 0 
               \\ 
                 1, &amp; \mbox{if }t &gt; 0
               \\
                 \frac{1}{2}, &amp; \mbox{if }t = 0
               \end{matrix}
             \right.
&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, u(0) is given other values, usually either 0 or 1.  For many applications, it is irrelevant what the value at zero is.
u(0) is generally written as undefined.

=== Derivative ===
The unit step function is level in all places except for a discontinuity at t = 0. For this reason, the derivative of the unit step function is 0 at all points t, except where t = 0. Where t = 0, the derivative of the unit step function is infinite.

The derivative of a unit step function is called an '''impulse function'''. The impulse function will be described in more detail next.

=== Integral ===
The integral of a unit step function is computed as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^t u(s)ds = 

\left\{ 
    \begin{matrix}  0, &amp; \mbox{if }t &lt; 0   \\ 
                   \int_0^t ds = t, &amp; \mbox{if }t \ge 0 
    \end{matrix}
\right\} = tu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the integral of a unit step is a &quot;ramp&quot; function. This function is 0 for all values that are less than zero, and becomes a straight line at zero with a slope of +1.

=== Time Inversion ===

if we want to reverse the unit step function, we can flip it around the y axis as such: u(-t). With a little bit of manipulation, we can come to an important result:

:&lt;math&gt;u(-t) = 1 - u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Other Properties ===

Here we will list some other properties of the unit step function: 

*&lt;math&gt;u(\infty) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;u(-\infty) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;u(t) + u(-t) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

These are all important results, and the reader should be familiar with them.

== Impulse Function ==


An impulse function is a special function that is often used by engineers to model certain events. An impulse function is not realizable, in that by definition the output of an impulse function is infinity at certain values. An impulse function is also known as a &quot;delta function&quot;, although there are different types of delta functions that each have slightly different properties.  Specifically, this ''unit-impulse function'' is known as the Dirac delta function.  The term &quot;Impulse Function&quot; is unambiguous, because there is only one definition of the term &quot;Impulse&quot;.

Let's start by drawing out a rectangle function, D(t), as such:
[[Image:Dirac Delta.svg|right|300px]]
We can define this rectangle in terms of the unit step function:

:&lt;math&gt;D(t) = \frac{1}{A}[u(t + A/2) - u(t - A/2)]&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we want to analyze this rectangle, as A becomes infinitesimally small. We can define this new function, the '''delta function''', in terms of this rectangle:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = \lim_{A \to 0}\frac{1}{A}[u(t + A/2) - u(t - A/2)]&lt;/math&gt;

We can similarly define the delta function piecewise, as such:

#&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = 0\mbox{ for } t \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) &gt; 0\mbox{ for } t = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t) dt = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Although, this definition is less rigorous than the previous definition.

=== Integration ===

From its definition it follows that the integral of the impulse function is just the step function:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \delta(t)dt = u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, defining the derivative of the unit step function as the impulse function is justified.

=== Shifting Property ===

Furthermore, for an integrable function ''f'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t - A) f(t)dt = f(A)&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the '''shifting property''' (also known as the '''sifting property''' or the '''sampling property''') of the delta function; it effectively samples the value of the function ''f'', at location ''A''.  

The delta function has many uses in engineering, and one of the most important uses is to sample a continuous function into discrete values.

Using this property, we can extract a single value from a continuous function by multiplying with an impulse, and then integrating.

=== Types of Delta ===

There are a number of different functions that are all called &quot;delta functions&quot;. These functions generally all look like an impulse, but there are some differences. Generally, this book uses the term &quot;delta function&quot; to refer to the '''Dirac Delta Function'''.

*[[w:Dirac delta function]] 
*[[w:Kronecker delta]]

== Sinc Function ==

There is a particular form that appears so frequently in communications engineering, that we give it its own name. This function is called the &quot;Sinc function&quot; and is discussed below:

The Sinc function is defined in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \mbox{ if } x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
and 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The value of sinc(x) is defined as 1 at x = 0, since  

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 0}\operatorname{sinc}(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This fact can be proven by noting that for x near 0,

:&lt;math&gt;1 &gt; \frac{\sin{(x)}}{x} &gt; \cos{(x)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then, since cos(0) = 1, we can apply the [[Calculus/Limits/An_Introduction_to_Limits#The_Squeeze_Theorem|''Squeeze Theorem'']] to show that the sinc function approaches one as x goes to zero. Thus, defining sinc(0) to be 1 makes the sinc function continuous.

Also, the Sinc function approaches zero as x goes towards infinity, with the envelope of sinc(x) tapering off as 1/x.

== '''Rect Function''' ==

The Rect Function is a function which produces a rectangular-shaped pulse with a width of 1 centered at t = 0. The Rect function pulse also has a height of 1.
The Sinc function and the rectangular function form a Fourier transform pair.

A Rect function can be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rect}\left(\frac{t-X}{Y} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the pulse is centered at X and has width Y. We can define the impulse function above in terms of the rectangle function by centering the pulse at zero (X = 0), setting it's height to 1/A and setting the pulse width to A, which approaches zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) = \lim_{A \to 0} \frac{1}{A}\operatorname{rect}\left(\frac{t-0}{A}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can also construct a Rect function out of a pair of unit step functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rect}\left(\frac{t-X}{Y} \right) = u(t - X + Y/2) - u(t - X - Y/2)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, both unit step functions are set a distance of Y/2 away from the center point of (t - X).

== Square Wave ==

A square wave is a series of rectangular pulses. Here are some examples of square waves:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
|[[Image:Square Wave T.svg|center|300px]]
|[[Image:Square Wave 2T.svg|center|300px]]
|-
|colspan=2|These two square waves have the same amplitude, but the second has a lower frequency. We can see that the period of the second is approximately twice as large as the first, and therefore that the frequency of the second is about half the frequency of the first.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Square Wave T.svg|center|300px]]
|[[Image:Square Wave Offset.svg|center|300px]]
|-
|colspan=2|These two square waves have the same frequency and the same peak-to-peak amplitude, but the second wave has no DC offset. Notice how the second wave is centered on the ''x'' axis, while the first wave is completely above the ''x'' axis.
|}

==Video Tutorial==
A video tutorial has been created for this chapter in Blender 2.48a.

It is compressed and packaged in the Theora (.ogg) video format and requires a player that is able to decode this codec in order to play it, such as the [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC] player which is available as a free download for Windows, Mac, and most Linux distributions. Firefox 3.5 is also able to stream Theora video.

For best results, it is recommended that you save this file to your computer for viewing, rather than streaming it inside a web browser, since it is 1020 x 746 pixels.

[[File:Blender3D Die Another Way.ogv|765px]]

==Introduction==
In the following tutorial you will be creating a die. You will use:
*polygon mesh
*face loop cutting
*subdivision surfaces
*subdivision creases
*bevel
*set smooth
*multiple materials
*extrusion
*merge vertices
*remove doubles
*constraints

There are two methods to create the circles for the die: subdivide first, or manual sizing. In either case, start with the default Cube.

==Subdivide First==
The die needs to have a 3x3 matrix for the coloured dots (pips).  A quick way to do this is to simply ''Subdivide'' the cube twice before doing anything else.  The disadvantage may be that the spaces for the pips may not be exactly the size that you want.  If not, see the next section: Manual Sizing of Pips.

== Manual Sizing of Pips ==
=== Step 1 ===
Hit tab to go into edit-mode and select all faces to prevent bevel
messing up normals. Hit '''WKEY''' ''&amp;rarr; Bevel'', ''Recursion &amp;rarr; 1'' (you'll see why
later) then choose bevel size (hit spacebar for manual input). Bevel of 0.150 is ok. &lt;br&gt;
Note: If you have chosen to subdivide the die twice, jump to Section &quot;Creating Pips&quot; and put bevel of 0.17 in order to have pip's edges length 0.34

[[Image:DieAnotherWay2.png]]

=== Step 2 ===
In editmode, go to the Editing tab ('''F9''') and look at the '''&lt;u&gt;Mesh Tools 1&lt;/u&gt;''' panel (''Mesh Tools More'' in some versions). Turn on Edge Length and note the length of one of the sides of the
square faces. This should be 1.7 if the
above settings were used.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Button &quot;Edge Length&quot; may be outside the screen so you may need to close another set of buttons before you can get to it.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Or, you can use MMB to scroll over to see the Mesh Tools 1 panel (in later versions: Mesh Tools More) with &quot;Edge Length&quot; button on it.&lt;br&gt;
Or, you can zoom in and out in the menu window with CTRL and NUM+ or NUM-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Or, you can press HOME when button window is focused to see all buttons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay3b.png]]

=== Step 3 ===
A typical die has a grid of 9 possible positions for the pips and
the gap between the pips is the pip radius (or half the diameter). So, there are
conveniently 10 units on each edge of the square faces, where the gaps
use 4 of the units and the 3 pips use two each. This means the gaps are of
size 1.7/10 = 0.17 and the pips (1.7x2)/10 = 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:9 posiciones.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:muescas y espacios.jpg|341px]]

=== Step 4 ===
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway3-00.png|right|190px]]

Now it's time to subdivide the surfaces of the die according to the mathematics above. We'll do that using &quot;edge loops&quot; - additional edges you can add to existing objects.

*Select axis aligned view: '''NUM1'''
*Enter loop cut mode: '''CTRL+RKEY''' (OR '''KKEY→1KEY''' OR '''KKEY'''→''Loop Cut'' OR '''CTRL+EKEY'''→''Loopcut'' OR '''CTRL+EKEY'''→'''NUM5''')
*Select loops' placement: move the mouse around until you see a purple line going the right direction.
&lt;!--*Assure: axis aligned view '''NUM1''' AND orthographic view '''NUM5''' AND selection not limited to visible (can't find hotkey for this)--&gt;
*Enter the number of loops: '''9KEY''' (OR '''NUM9''' OR '''SCROLL''' up 9 times OR '''NUM+''' 8 times)
*Add the loop: '''LMB''' (OR '''ENTER''' etc.) on one of the big faces
&lt;small&gt;''Noob: What's &quot;the right direction?&quot; What should this thing look like after applying the loop/cut?  HELP!''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;''Another Noob: It sounds like you have version 2.44 or later. You should do the tuturial &quot;Die Easy&quot;(seriously, it is).''&lt;/small&gt;

Now we just have to get rid of the 2nd, 5th and 8th loops to make the undivided spaces for the marks.

*Select edge select or vertex select: '''CTRL+TAB→NUM2''' (OR '''CTRL+TAB'''→''Edges'' OR '''CTRL+TAB→NUM1''' etc.)
&lt;!--*Select edge on a loop to remove: '''RMB''' --&gt;
*Deselect all edges with AKEY
*Choose a loop to remove (using the BKEY to enter box selection mode and drawing a box around the one you want; this will get the whole loop, all the way around the cube).&lt;small&gt;Spoiler: you can also use Alt-RMB on an edge to select a loop (or select the edge and click ''Select --&gt; Edge loop'').&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''Noob: It seems that I could not remove multi loops at the same time, since the error message kept bumping out.''
Another Noob: That happened to me when I tried to remove them all at once, but it worked fine when I removed one at a time.&lt;/small&gt;
*Remove loop: '''XKEY→7''' (OR '''XKEY'''→''Edge Loop'')
Change views with NUM3 and NUM7 and repeat steps as necessary. When you're done, your die should look like the one pictured to the right.

== Creating Pips ==
The die needs the pips added.  Everyone knows how the pips on a die look, right?
=== Extrude and Merge ===
(Note: This is Step 10)  
Select one of the faces where a pip would go and extrude the face by hitting '''EKEY''' and then '''ESC'''. Do not click after hitting '''EKEY'''.  This actually replaces the first face with another one even though it looks like nothing has happened.  Merge the second face by using '''ALT + MKEY''' to merge the 4 corners into the centre.  It will tell you ''Removed 3 vertices''.  &lt;font style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;[User Note: To clarify, pressing ESC when extruding does in fact extrude the face as per usual, but by a distance of zero.  This creates four new, infinitely narrow faces around the original square face. These four faces then get 'dragged' into the middle when the four vertices of the original square are merged into one.  Test this by extruding by say, 0.01 (instead of pressing ESC), and you'll see the result is almost the same.][User Note: on my computer hitting ESC after the EKEY seemed to cancel the extrude and to get the correct result I had to hit the &quot;ENTER&quot; key after the EKEY]&lt;/font&gt;  You should get the following:

[[Image:DieAnotherWay10a.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Do this for the configuration of the dots on that side. So for
example, 5 would look like this:

[[Image:DieAnotherWay10b.png|200px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Notes : &lt;br&gt;
* You could create this pip spot on all 9 spots and copy this side of the die to the other six.  The amount of time spent doing all of that may be just as long as doing each side individually. You would need to delete the other 5 faces, copy the dented face 5 times, place each face precisely by rotating and moving, and remove doubles.
* (User comment) I accidentally selected some pip faces from the opposite side of the die (the side behind the side I was looking at).  To prevent this, I selected ''Limit selection to visible'' (''Occlude background geometry'' in 2.47) [[Image:BlenderCommonLSTV-on.png]]: which should be the second button from the right in the header of the  ''3D View''.
* '''Noob, 19th Oct 2008:''' You can save time by selecting all the 'pip faces' and extruding them simultaneously, '''ESC'''-ing immediately after you do so, like above. You'll still need to merge the four corners of each extrusion one-by-one, though, or you'll get some odd results.
* '''Noob, 28th Dec 2008:''' You can save more time be extruding all faces simultaneously, as above, and then selecting &quot;Collapse&quot; rather than &quot;At Center&quot; while merging.
* '''Noob, 02/02/09:''' I tried with the &quot;Collapse&quot; trick as well but all I got were just black squares.
* '''Noob, 19/02/09:''' I got the black squares as well, but it is just a display problem. Press ''Tab'' twice (going to ''Object mode'' and back to ''Edit mode'') and they are gone.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Create Pips ===
(Note: This is Step 11)  Select one of the edges of the pips to check the size is 0.34.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Remember the pip radius was 0.17. We need to use this value to lower
the centre point of the pips. Select all the 5 centre points at
once to save time and move them inwards by 0.17. The side I put the 5
pips on here was the top so I move the vertices inwards by pressing '''GKEY''', '''ZKEY''', -0.17 and hitting '''ENTER'''. I then get this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay11b.png]]

(user comment) According to step 4 we are still in front-view ('''NUM1'''), but then the '''ZKEY''' modification gives undesirable result, changing view to top ('''NUM7''') does the trick! This applies to blender version 2.44.
* (response) Actually, at the end of step 4 it states to change to side and top view ('''NUM3''' and '''NUM7''') as necessary, so really there is no official view the tutorial left the user in.  Also, in this step, the writer mentions they put 5 pips on the top.
* (user comment) using '''YKEY''' instead of '''ZKEY''' is also fine.
* (user comment) Depending on which axis it's supposed to be moved, use the '''ZKEY''','''XKEY''' and '''YKEY''' after the '''GKEY''' accordingly.
* (user comment) Pressing '''ZKEY''' twice should move them along the normal, which should work no matter which faces are selected.
* (user comment) I noticed a shortcut: When you extrude, extrude by -0.17 and then do the Merge -&gt; Collapse. Then the point is already inside.
* (user comment) I just noticed something different. If you extrude and collapse, after applying the subsurf, you got sharp edges of the pips than the pips I got in this tutorial way.
* (user comment) In blender 2.49a there is an issue where when &quot;Occlude background geometry&quot; is on, sometimes you'll click a vertex and have a far away vertex clicked instead. Rotating the camera usually helps, and if you find your vertex isn't selected, but you know you clicked, clicking again will deselect whatever vertex you selected. Also a big issue with the extrusion - as with escape, right clicking to exit extrusion also creates an &quot;unseen extrusion&quot; .  The &quot;unseen extrusion&quot; can be noticed - there's black dots in the middle of your square edges. This is caused by the 0-width faces being selectable (and therefore having a dot in the middle). I had to completely do-over my model because Remove Doubles _did not_ remove the extra vertices. This became noticeable when I would extrude and it would only extrude vertices.
* (user comment): Don't collapse the vertices! In that case, the pits will be rendered badly. Collapsing removes four vertices, merging at the center removes three vertices --&gt; so there is a difference!
* (user comment): You can just have the pivot be Individual Centers and scale to zero, then you can remove doubles and it works out fine. That's the fastest way I can think of doing this.

=== Smooth Out ===
'''TAB''' out of Edit Mode. If you haven't done this already, hit Set Smooth in the Editing panel and turn on subdivision surfaces&lt;br&gt;
It should look something like this:


In present versions, you just need to use &quot;Add Modifier&quot; on the Modifiers tab (in Edit-mode), to add a SubSurf modifier. (Or press '''SHIFT+OKEY''')&lt;br&gt;
In the image below Levels is set to 3.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay12c.png]]

=== Make Sharp Edges ===
On a die, the edges of the pips are usually sharp so we'll use
subsurface creasing to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go back into editmode and with the edge select mode on, select all the
perimeters of the pips like so (it may help to turn off subsurf for
the moment):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay13.png|200px]]&lt;br&gt;
Press '''SHIFT+EKEY''' to enable creasing and move the mouse until the display
says crease is at 1. (to see the effect, you must have the subsurf modifier
turned ON).&amp;nbsp; After pressing '''SHIFT+EKEY''', you can then set
crease values in the information box that you get by pressing '''NKEY''' when
objects are selected. This can be useful to check if all the edges have
the right crease because it gives you the average crease value and if
it is less than 1, there is an edge wrong.&lt;br&gt;
'''Newbie Note:''' Trying to crease all 6 sides of the die at once using 
'''SHIFT+EKEY''' and moving the mouse doesn't crease all sides of the die. 
Better to use '''NKEY''', or do one side at a time.

=== Repeat ===
Repeat steps 10, 11 and 13 (that is [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Die_Another_Way#Extrude_and_Merge|Extrude and Merge]], [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Die_Another_Way#Create_Pips|Create Pips]] and [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Die_Another_Way#Make_Sharp_Edges|Make Sharp Edges]]) for all the sides of the die. REMEMBER, a die is
numbered so that opposite sides add up to 7. In my example, that means
I put 2 on the bottom etc. Once you finish, if you turn on subdiv level 2,
you will get something like this:&lt;br&gt; &lt;font style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;[User Note: Do you mean subsurf instead of subdiv?]&lt;/font&gt; 
* Noob note: On the side with 6 pips, I had a hard time getting the creases to work.  It turned out to be because I selected in vertex mode when I selected the edges for creasing, and I tried to crease all 6 pips at once.  This put crease values on the short vertical edges between the pips, which messed things up.
[[Image:DieAnotherWay14.png|200px]]

* User Shortcut: To do them all at once with no repeating. However, order of operation has to change to make it work:
** In Face Select mode, select all pip faces on all sides.
** '''SHIFT+EKEY''' to crease the edges. (needs to be done before extruding, since extruding changed the selection)
** '''EKEY -&gt; Individual Faces''' then type -0.17 to extrude all faces inward.
** '''ALT+MKEY -&gt; Collapse''' will merge all the extrusions to their respective centers.
(noobie) Some of my pips are square and I tried everything. What should I do?
(noob reply) Maybe you had the vertex at the center of pips selected while creasing.

=== Camera Setup ===
You can make a test render now to see that the pips are the right
size and that the bevel is right. So, turn the subsurf level for the
rendering up to 3. To help position the camera so that you centre the
die, you can make the camera look at the die by adding a track-to
constraint to it. I prefer to track an empty though, because it is more
flexible.

&lt;br&gt;
Make an empty by going into top down view ('''NUM7''') and hitting
'''SPACE''' ''&amp;rarr; Add &amp;rarr; Empty''.
('''Noob note:''' If you can't find &quot;empty&quot; in the list, make sure you are in Object mode.) It's always best to go into one of the set
orthographic views so as to align new objects to the axes. If you add
something misaligned, just go to the object menu then clear/apply &amp;gt; clear
rotation (or '''ALT+RKEY'''). Because the empty was created at the origin, you
might not be able to see it as it is inside the die. Hit '''ZKEY''' to enable
wireframe mode and select the empty. Just move it outside the cube
until we get the constraint set up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To add a track-to constraint, select the camera first then '''SHIFT+RMB'''
the empty and press '''CTRL+TKEY''' and choose &quot;TrackTo Constraint&quot; from the list. Move the
empty back inside the die. You can edit constraints in the object tab ('''F7''').
Add a couple of lamps (both intensity 1) to get the scene like this or feel free to experiment with a more advanced lighting setup:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Another way to position the camera is by selecting it and then looking
through it as you move it. Look through the camera by pressing
'''NUM0'''. Use the '''GKEY''' to pan across and rotate around the local axes
of the camera by pressing say '''RKEY''','''XKEY''','''XKEY''' to rotate in X-axis. To zoom in and out
press '''GKEY''', '''ZKEY''', '''ZKEY''' and then move your mouse forwards or backwards. Another useful keystroke (for pre-2.43 especially) to know is that when you are in camera view, pressing '''Gkey''' and then '''MMB''', movement will be constrained to the way you are facing. The '''mouse wheel''' zoom moves your view towards and away from the camera, without actually moving the position of the camera.&lt;br&gt;

You can also move the Camera in free &quot;Fly&quot; mode by going into the Camera view (press NUM0) and then Shift+F. Now you can &quot;Fly&quot; through the scene and use this setup the camera angle. Make sure that you keey the flying velocity very low by using the scroll wheels or -/+ buttons or the camera will be simply out of control.

=== Render ===
To render, set the size of the image you want. 800x600 is a decent
size so put these settings in the format panel in the Scene tab ('''F10''').
In the render panel, make sure 100% is selected. If it's 50%,
the render will come out as 400x300. For preview renders, don't turn on
OSA, which is anti-aliasing because it slows your renders down
significantly. Try to only use it for a final render.&lt;br&gt;

Another important point is to set the image format. This is done in the
format panel. The listbox has a number of image types. I find
that png is generally the best because it is lossless and offers the
highest compression among the lossless formats. It also supports an
alpha channel for transparency. When rendering an animation, it is
better to render as an image sequence than as a movie because it is
easier to edit these and repair broken frames. Quicktime supports
loading of image sequences and you can save as a movie using
a wide range of compression formats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To save the render, go to the '''file menu → save image''' (Or press '''F3''') and type in the
full name of the image including the extension e.g. die.png.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The output should now be looking something like this:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DieAnotherWay15.png]]&lt;br&gt;
[user note] To get such a nice render I had to bump the render level of subsurf up to 5, otherwise I get artifacts around the pips
&lt;br&gt;
[user reply] If OSA is on for the final render, you'll get a nice render result as shown by the above figure with subsurf level 3.
&lt;br&gt;
[user note] If you set smooth on the whole shape, you'll get artifacts around the circles.
&lt;br&gt;
[user reply] To avoid artifacts around the circles, you'll have to turn on '''Auto Smooth'''

== Color ==
=== Multiple Materials ===
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-01.png|right]]

.
.
&lt;br&gt;
To give it some colour, we will need to use multiple materials
because a typical die has pips that are a different colour from the
die itself.&lt;br&gt;
In the ''Buttons Window''  [[Image:BlenderCommonButtonswindow.png]] go to the ''Editing'' panel [[Image:BlenderCommonEditing-on.png]] ('''F9''') again and make sure the die is selected. In the ''Links and Materials'' subpanel there is a section for materials (the right; the left one is for vertex groups) and the box left of the question mark should read &quot;''0 Mat 0''&quot; (the first number is the number of material links for this object; the second number is the number of the currently selected material link).[[Image:DieAnotherWay17.png|left|132px]]
The die may have more than zero materials if you had assigned materials to the object already. By pressing the ''New'' button add enough materials to make 2 in total.

[[Image:DieAnotherWay17b.png|left]]
Go back to the ''Shading'' panel [[Image:BlenderCommonShading-on.png]] ('''F5''') and there is a box at the very top of the ''Links and Pipelines'' subpanel with the number 2 beside it. If there is no such subpanel select ''Material buttons'' [[Image:BlenderCommonMaterialbuttons-on.png]] (cycle shading buttons using '''F5''' too). Click this number and select ''Single user'' in the dialog to make the two materials you've just created independent. Use the arrows on the left side of the box to switch materials.
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-04.png|right]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Note: If you do not see a ''2'' to the right of the material name, that means the material is already a single user material. To change it back you can click the button labelled ''F'', but for this example, you do not want to do that.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
Note: There should be at least two materials now. One has the materials initial name the other has a number appended to its name (e.g. ''Material'' and ''Material.001'').
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Use the ''Material'' subpanel to make material 1 bright red by just picking red in the colour picker (the rectangle to the left of the ''Col'' button) or by setting the RGB sliders (right of the ''Col'' button). Make material 2 white by doing the same. Or pick whatever colour you prefer and material settings.
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-04a.png|left]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:#888888&quot;&gt;
'''--[[User:MSK61|MSK61]] ([[User talk:MSK61|talk]]) 11:27, 17 March 2008 (UTC)''': The colour picker is to the left(not right) of the ''Col'' button, while the the RGB sliders are to the right(not left) of the ''Col'' button.

Note: It is possible that the two materials were not automatically linked to the material links of your die. If so use the ''Links and Pipeline'' subpanel to link the &lt;font style=&quot;color:#0000FF&quot;&gt;materials&lt;/font&gt; to the respective &lt;font style=&quot;color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;material links&lt;/font&gt;. First select the link then the material.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'' Note from noob: Using white as a colour will not let you spot a change in colour, since the default colour '''is''' white. For test purposes I recommend you choose another colour (e.g. blue), so you can avoid getting confused.''

'' Note from another noob: Actually (at least in blender 2.49), the default color is grey. To choose a white color, set all colors (R,G,B) up to 1.000.''

=== Assign Materials ===
These colours need to be assigned to the right parts of the die.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:BlenderDieanotherway5-05.png|right|190px]]
[[Image:DieAnotherWay18b.png|right|190px]]
Go into ''Edit Mode'' and turn off subsurf to make selecting easier. Do this in the ''Editing'' panels ('''F9''') ''Modifiers'' subpanel. Right after the subsurf modifiers name there are three buttons (darkgrey). Press the rightmost to deactivate the modifier in the edit mode.

==== To make the die red ====

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Select the entire die (AKEY).
*Click the Editing button (F9).
*In the Link and Materials panel, on the right-hand side you will see &quot;2 Mat X&quot; where X is either 1 or 2. Click the left/right arrows until you see the adjoining square to the left turn red. As you click on the arrows, notice that the label above &quot;2 Mat X&quot; changes from &quot;Material&quot; to &quot;Material.001&quot;. These are the names of the materials that you created in the Shading (F5)-&gt;Links and Pipeline panel.
*Click the Assign button (in the Material column, not the Vertex Groups column). The Assign button associates the selected faces with the selected material.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The entire die should now be red.

==== To make the pips white ====

Use the same method as above, but with only the inner faces of the pips selected and with the colour white.

There are a variety of ways to select the inner faces of the pips:

==== Pip Selection Method 1 ====
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Note: Here you may find ''Lasso Select'' useful.
*Make sure you are in ''Edit Mode'' [[Image:BlenderCommonEditmode.png]] ('''TAB''')
*Select ''Face select'' [[Image:BlenderCommonFaceselect-on.png]]: '''CTRL+TAB&amp;rarr;3KEY'''
*Select ''Limit selection to visible'' [[Image:BlenderCommonLSTV-on.png]]: should be the second button from the right in the header of the  ''3D View''
*Go through the axis align views and select the faces:
**Align view: '''NUM1''' ('''CTRL+NUM1''', '''NUM3''', '''CTRL+NUM3''', '''NUM7''', '''CTRL+NUM7''')
**For each view, lasso select the pips' faces: hold '''CTRL''' and drag '''LMB''' around the pips' middle vertex (no need to press '''SHIFT''', ''Lasso Select'' automatically adds the new faces to the previous selection).
*If all went well you should be able to read ''Fa:84-449'' in the ''User Preferences'' right after the Blender version number. (84 = 4*(1+2+3+4+5+6))
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Pip Selection Method 2 ====
Press '''CTRL'''+'''ALT'''+'''SHIFT'''+'''3KEY''' and every triangular face will be selected.(Every pip + The 8 corners of the dice. Just deselect the 8 corners and you're good to go!) ;-)
Similarly, you can select quad faces using the '''4KEY'''. 

==== Pip Selection Method 3 ====
You can also use circle select to easily select the desired faces. Enter circle select mode by hitting '''BKEY''' twice. The circle can be made bigger or smaller by using the '''scroll wheel'''. Drop out of the mode ('''RMB''') to rotate the cube and drop back in as above. Selected vertices are added to those already selected like with lasso mode but without the need to keep holding the control key or draw an accurate lasso)

[[Image:DieAnotherWay18.png|left|200px]]

&lt;br&gt;
Turn subsurf back on (''Modifiers panel''→subsurf modifier→enable in edit mode) and render '''F12''' with OSA (only put it up as high as you need for the resolution of the image you are rendering).

''(Note: in Blender 2.44 you should use the ''Assign button'' in the editing panel (''Link and Materials''))''

''(another noob says: don't be fooled (as I was!) by the fact that there are TWO Assign buttons in this tab, you want the big one on the right under materials, not the small one on the left under Vertex groups!!)''

{{subject|}}

==== Pip Selection Method 4 ====

That's the easiest way:
1- select one of the triangles (the face)
2- '''Shift+Gkey''', then choose perimeter or press '''4NUM'''.

=== Extra ===
The reason I modelled the die this way is because it is also very easy
to change the sizes of the components e.g. the bevel and the pip size.
You do this by selecting the vertical or horizontal segments and just
scaling them in one axis. Here we will reduce the pip size and the
bevel by half.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Go into front view ('''NUM1'''), turn off clipping (i.e., allow selection of invisible vertices) and select a line containing pips (i.e., Select vertices mode ('''CTRL+TAB+NUM1'''), and box select a thin vertical line of vertices to the left of a row of pips, then box select another thin vertical line of vertices to the right of that row of pips, making a total of 64 vertices).  Then just scale in one axis e.g. '''SKEY''', '''XKEY''', 0.5. Remember to
have your pivot point set to median:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- don;t exist any longer [[Image:DieAnotherWayE1.png|200px|]]&lt;br&gt; --&gt;
Do this horizontally and vertically around the die. You should need to
scale 9 times for the pips and 6 times for the bevel:

''(Noob note: I find this confusing.  what is a line containing pips?  does this mean a loop line?  Using alt-RMB no longer works to select a loop, but selects a single edge.)''

''(Noob response: he meant a pair of loops of vertices adjacent to a row containing pips.  alt-RMB no longer seems to select complete loops - it works until it hits a pip and then it stops - but the box selection can be used.)''

''(Another Response: Any time you change the geometry of a shape you effect how the automated tools will work.  Many dont work at all once you get to complex organic shapes, so its best to not rely on them too heavily.)''

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- don;t exist any longer[[Image:DieAnotherWayE2.png|200px|]]&lt;br&gt; --&gt;
You may need to add extra geometry once you are satisfied with the
sizes of the dots and the bevel so that the edges of the die don't look
warped due to the subdivision. You can use face loop cut again for that
and add extra lines in the middle of the gap segments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- don;t exist any longer [[Image:DieAnotherWayE3.png|200px|]]&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

== Circuits ==

'''Circuits''' (also known as &quot;networks&quot;) are collections of circuit elements and wires. Wires are designated on a schematic as being straight lines. Nodes are locations on a schematic where 2 or more wires connect, and are usually marked with a dark black dot. Circuit Elements are &quot;everything else&quot; in a sense. Most basic circuit elements have their own symbols so as to be easily recognizable, although some will be drawn as a simple box image, with the specifications of the box written somewhere that is easy to find. We will discuss several types of basic circuit components in this book.

== Ideal Wires ==

For the purposes of this book, we will assume that an ideal wire has zero total resistance, no capacitance, and no inductance. A consequence of these assumptions is that these ideal wires have infinite bandwidth, are immune to interference, and are — in essence — completely uncomplicated. This is not the case in real wires, because all wires have at least some amount of associated resistance. Also, placing multiple real wires together, or bending real wires in certain patterns will produce small amounts of capacitance and inductance, which can play a role in circuit design and analysis. This book will assume that all wires are ideal.

== Ideal Junctions or Nodes ==

[[File:Node-pressure.jpg|thumb|right|Nodes are areas where the Electromotive Force is the same.]]

Nodes are also called &quot;junctions&quot; in this book in order to make a distinction between Node analysis, Kirchhoff's current law and discussions about a physical node itself. Here a physical node is discussed. 

A junction is a group of wires that share the same [[:wikipedia:Electromotive_force|electromotive force]] (not voltage). Wires ideally have no resistance, thus all wires that touch wire to wire somewhere are part of the same node. The diagram on the right shows three big blue nodes, two smaller green nodes and two trivial (one wire touching another) nodes. 

Sometimes a node is described as where two or more wires touch and students circle where wires intersect and call this a node. This only works on simple circuits.

One node has to be labeled ground in any circuit drawn before voltage can be computed or the circuit simulated. Typically this is the node having the most components connected to it. Logically it is normally placed at the bottom of the circuit logic diagram.

Ground is not always needed physically. Some circuits are [[:w:Floating_ground|floated]] on purpose. 

[[/NodeQuiz/|Node Quiz]]

== Measuring instruments ==
'''Voltmeters and Ammeters''' are devices that are used to measure the voltage across an element, and the current flowing through a wire, respectively. 

=== Ideal Voltmeters ===
An ideal voltmeter has an infinite resistance (in reality, several megaohms), and acts like an open circuit. A [[:wikiversity:Tutorial_on_preparing_the_multimeter_for_start_measuring_the_voltage|voltmeter]] is placed across the terminals of a circuit element, to determine the voltage across that element. In practice the voltmeter siphons a enough energy to move a needle, cause thin strips of metal to separate or turn on a transistor so a number is displayed.

=== Ideal Ammeters ===

An ideal ammeter has zero resistance and acts like a short circuit. Ammeters require cutting a wire and plugging the two ends into the Ammeter. In practice an ammeter places a tiny resistor in a wire and measures the tiny voltage across it or the ammeter measures the [[:w:Clamp_meter|magnetic field strength]] generated by current flowing through a wire. Ammeters are not used that much because of the wire cutting, or wire disconnecting they require.

== Active Passive &amp; ReActive ==

The elements which are capable of delivering energy or which are capable to amplify the signal are called &quot;Active elements&quot;. All power supplies fit into this category.

The elements which will receive the energy and dissipate it are called &quot;Passive elements&quot;. Resistors model these devices. 

Reactive elements store and release energy into a circuit. Ideally they don't either consume or generate energy. Capacitors, and inductors fall into this category.

== Open and Short Circuits ==

===Open===
No current flows through an open. Normally an '''open''' is created by a bad connector. Dust, bad solder joints, bad crimping, cracks in circuit board traces, create an '''open'''. Capacitors respond to DC by turning into '''opens''' after charging up. Uncharged inductors appear as '''opens''' immediately after powering up a circuit. The word '''open''' can refer to a problem description. The word '''open''' can also help develop an intuition about circuits. 

Typically the circuit stops working with opens because 99% of all circuits are driven by voltage power sources. Voltage sources respond to an open with no current. Opens are the equivalent of clogs in plumbing .. which stop water from flowing.

On one side of the open, EMF will build up, just like water pressure will build up on one side of a clogged pipe. Typically a voltage will appear across the open.

===Short===
A voltage source responds to a '''short''' by delivering as much current as possible. An extreme example of this can be seen in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g60okBMeTKo ball bearing motor video]. The motor appears as a short to the battery. Notice he only completes the short for a short time because he is worried about the car battery exploding. 

Maximum current flows through a '''short'''. Normally a '''short''' is created by a wire, a nail, or some loose screw touching parts of the circuit unintentionally. Most component failures start with heat build up. The heat destroys varnish, paint, or thin insulation creating a '''short'''. The '''short''' causes more current to flow which causes more heat. This cycle repeats faster and faster until there is a puff of smoke and everything breaks creating an '''open'''. Most component failures start with a '''short''' and end in an '''open''' as they burn up. Feel the air temperature above each circuit component after power on. Build a memory of what normal operating temperatures are. Cold can indicate a short that has already turned into an open. 

An uncharged capacitor initially appears as a '''short''' immediately after powering on a circuit. An inductor appears as a '''short''' to DC after charging up. The '''short''' concept also helps build our intuition, provides an opportunity to talk about electrical safety and helps describe component failure modes. 

A '''closed''' switch can be thought of as short. [[:wikipedia:Switch|Switches]] are surprisingly complicated. It is in a study of switches that the term '''closed''' begins to dominate that of '''short'''.</text>

There are many tools available to analyze a system in the time domain, although many of these tools are very complicated and involved. Nonetheless, these tools are invaluable for use in the study of linear signals and systems, so they will be covered here.

== Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems ==

This page will contain the definition of a LTI system and this will be used to motivate the definition of convolution as the output of a LTI system in the next section. To begin with a system has to be defined and the LTI properties have to be listed. Then, for a given input it can be shown (in this section or the following) that the output of a LTI system is a convolution of the input and the system's impulse response, thus motivating the definition of convolution.

Consider a system for which an input of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' results in an output of ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' respectively for ''i = 1, 2''.

=== Linearity ===

There are 3 requirements for ''linearity''. A function must satisfy all 3 to be called &quot;linear&quot;. 

#'''Additivity''': An input of &lt;math&gt;x_3(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of  &lt;math&gt;y_3(t) = y_1(t) + y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;. 
#'''Homogeneity''': An input of &lt;math&gt;ax_1&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of &lt;math&gt;ay_1&lt;/math&gt;
#If x(t) = 0, y(t) = 0. 

&quot;Linear&quot; in this sense is not the same word as is used in conventional algebra or geometry. Specifically, linearity in signals applications has nothing to do with straight lines. Here is a small example:

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = x(t) + 5&lt;/math&gt;

This function is not linear, because when x(t) = 0, y(t) = 5 (fails requirement 3). This may surprise people, because this equation is the equation for a straight line!

Being linear is also known in the literature as &quot;satisfying the principle of superposition&quot;. '''Superposition''' is a fancy term for saying that the system is additive and homogeneous. The terms linearity and superposition can be used interchangably, but in this book we will prefer to use the term linearity exclusively.

We can combine the three requirements into a single equation:
In a linear system, an input of &lt;math&gt;a_1x_1(t)+a_2x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; results in an output of &lt;math&gt;a_1y_1(t)+a_2y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Additivity ===

A system is said to be additive if a sum of inputs results in a sum of outputs. To test for additivity, we need to create two arbitrary inputs, ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(t)''. We then use these inputs to produce two respective outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = f(x_1(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = f(x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we need to take a sum of inputs, and prove that the system output is a sum of the previous outputs:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) + y_2(t) = f(x_1(t) + x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;

If this final relationship is not satisfied for ''all possible inputs'', then the system is not additive.

=== Homogeneity ===

Similar to additivity, a system is homogeneous if a scaled input (multiplied by a constant) results in a scaled output. If we have two inputs to a system:

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = f(x_1(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = f(x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = cx_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''c'' is an arbitrary constant. If this is the case then the system is homogeneous if

:&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = cy_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;

for any arbitrary ''c''.

=== Time Invariance ===

If the input signal ''x(t)'' produces an output ''y(t)'' then any time shifted input, ''x(t + &amp;delta;)'', results in a time-shifted output ''y(t + &amp;delta;)''.

This property can be satisfied if the transfer function of the system is not a function of time except expressed by the input and output.

=== Example: Simple Time Invariance ===

{{TextBox|1=
To demonstrate how to determine if a system is time-invariant, consider the two systems:
* System A: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = t\, x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
* System B: &lt;math&gt;\,\!b(t) = 10 x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Since system A explicitly depends on ''t'' outside of ''x(t)'' and ''y(t)'', it is '''time-variant'''. System B, however, does not depend explicitly on ''t'' so it is time-invariant (given ''x(t)'' is time-invariant).
}}

=== Example: Formal Proof ===

{{TextBox|1=
A more formal proof of why systems A &amp; B from above are respectively time varying and time-invariant is now presented. To perform this proof, the second definition of time invariance will be used.

;System A:
:Start with a delay of the input &lt;math&gt;x_d(t) = \,\!x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = t\, x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = t\, x_d(t) = t\, x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Now delay the output by &amp;delta;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = t\, x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = \,\!y(t + \delta) = (t + \delta) x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Clearly &lt;math&gt;y_1(t) \,\!\ne y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the system is not time-invariant.

;System B:
:Start with a delay of the input &lt;math&gt;x_d(t) = \,\!x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = 10 \, x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = 10 \,x_d(t) = 10 \,x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Now delay the output by &amp;delta;
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) = 10 \,x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_2(t) = y(t + \delta) = 10 \,x(t + \delta)&lt;/math&gt;
:Clearly &lt;math&gt;y_1(t) = \,\!y_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the system is time-invariant.
}}

== Linear Time Invariant (LTI) Systems ==

The system is linear time-invariant (LTI) if it satisfies both the property of linearity and time-invariance. This book will study LTI systems almost exclusively, because they are the easiest systems to work with, and they are ideal to analyze and design.

== Other Function Properties ==

Besides being linear, or time-invariant, there are a number of other properties that we can identify in a function:

=== Memory ===

A system is said to have memory if the output from the system is dependent on past inputs (or future inputs) to the system. A system is called ''memoryless'' if the output is only dependent on the current input. Memoryless systems are easier to work with, but systems with memory are more common in digital signal processing applications.
A memory system is also called a dynamic system whereas a memoryless system is called a static system.

=== Causality ===

Causality is a property that is very similar to memory. A system is called '''causal''' if it is only dependent on past or current inputs. A system is called '''non-causal''' if the output of the system is dependent on future inputs. Most of the practical systems are causal.

=== Stability ===

Stability is a very important concept in systems, but it is also one of the hardest function properties to prove. There are several different criteria for system stability, but the most common requirement is that the system must produce a finite output when subjected to a finite input. For instance, if we apply 5 volts to the input terminals of a given circuit, we would like it if the circuit output didn't approach infinity, and the circuit itself didn't melt or explode. This type of stability is often known as &quot;Bounded Input, Bounded Output&quot; stability, or BIBO.

Studying BIBO stability is a relatively complicated course of study, and later books on the Electrical Engineering bookshelf will attempt to cover the topic.

== Linear Operators ==

Mathematical operators that satisfy the property of linearity are known as '''linear operators'''. Here are some common linear operators:

#Derivative
#Integral
#Fourier Transform

=== Example: Linear Functions  ===

{{TextBox|Determine if the following two functions are linear or not:

#&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} x(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \frac{d}{dt}x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Impulse Response ==

=== Zero-Input Response ===
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=e^{-x}u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Zero-State Response ===
zero state response means transient response or natural response.

=== Second-Order Solution ===

== Convolution ==

{{Matlab CMD|conv}}

Convolution (folding together) is a complicated operation involving integrating, multiplying, adding, and time-shifting two signals together. Convolution is a key component to the rest of the material in this book.

The convolution ''a * b'' of two functions ''a'' and ''b'' is defined as the function:

:&lt;math&gt;(a*b)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty a(\tau)b(t - \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

The greek letter &amp;tau; (tau) is used as the integration variable, because the letter ''t'' is already in use. &amp;tau; is used as a &quot;dummy variable&quot; because we use it merely to calculate the integral. 

In the convolution integral, all references to ''t'' are replaced with &amp;tau;, except for the ''-t'' in the argument to the function ''b''. Function ''b'' is ''time inverted'' by changing &amp;tau; to -&amp;tau;. Graphically, this process moves everything from the right-side of the ''y'' axis to the left side and vice-versa. Time inversion turns the function into a mirror image of itself.

Next, function ''b'' is ''time-shifted'' by the variable ''t''. Remember, once we replace everything with &amp;tau;, we are now computing in the ''tau domain'', and not in the time domain like we were previously. Because of this, ''t'' can be used as a shift parameter.

We multiply the two functions together, time shifting along the way, and we take the area under the resulting curve at each point. Two functions overlap in increasing amounts until some &quot;watershed&quot; after which the two functions overlap less and less. Where the two functions overlap in the ''t'' domain, there is a value for the convolution. If one (or both) of the functions do not exist over any given range, the value of the convolution operation at that range will be zero.

After the integration, the definite integral plugs the variable ''t'' back in for remaining references of the variable &amp;tau;, and we have a function of ''t'' again. It is important to remember that the resulting function will be a combination of the two input functions, and will share some properties of both.

=== Properties of Convolution === 

The convolution function satisfies certain conditions:

;Commutativity:
: &lt;math&gt;f * g = g * f \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Associativity:
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g  * h) = (f  * g)  * h \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Distributivity:
: &lt;math&gt;f  * (g + h) = (f  * g) + (f  * h) \,&lt;/math&gt;

;Associativity With Scalar Multiplication:
: &lt;math&gt;a (f  * g) = (a f)  * g = f  * (a g) \,&lt;/math&gt;
for any real (or complex) number ''a''.

;Differentiation Rule
: &lt;math&gt;(f  * g)' = f' * g = f * g' \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 1===
{{TextBox|Find the convolution, ''z(t)'', of the following two signals, ''x(t)'' and ''y(t)'', by using (a) the integral representation of the convolution equation and (b) muliplication in the Laplace domain.

[[Image:Convolution Example 1 Signals.svg|center]]

The signal ''y(t)'' is simply the [[w:Heaviside step|Heaviside step]], ''u(t)''.

The signal ''x(t)'' is given by the following infinite sinusoid, ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'', and windowing function, ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;(t)'':

::&lt;math&gt;x_0(t)=\sin(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;x_w(t)=u(t)-u(t-2\pi)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Convoution Example 1 x-Signal, Window.svg|center]]

Thus, the convolution we wish to perform is therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=x(t) * y(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=\sin(t) \left[ u(t)-u(t-2\pi) \right] * u(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=\left[ \sin(t) u(t)- \sin(t)u(t-2\pi) \right] * u(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

From the distributive law:

::&lt;math&gt;z(t)=\sin(t) u(t) * u(t) - \sin(t)u(t-2\pi) * u(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;

}}

== Correlation ==

{{Matlab CMD|xcorr}}

Akin to Convolution is a technique called &quot;Correlation&quot; that combines two functions in the time domain into a single resultant function in the time domain. Correlation is not as important to our study as convolution is, but it has a number of properties that will be useful nonetheless.

The correlation of two functions, ''g(t)'' and ''h(t)'' is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{gh}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(\tau)h(t + \tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

Where the capital ''R'' is the '''Correlation Operator''', and the subscripts to ''R'' are the arguments to the correlation operation. 

We notice immediately that correlation is similar to convolution, except that we don't time-invert the second argument before we shift and integrate. Because of this, we can define correlation in terms of convolution, as such:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{gh}(t) = g(t) * h(-t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Uses of Correlation ===

Correlation is used in many places because it demonstrates one important fact: Correlation determines how much similarity there is between the two argument functions. The more the area under the correlation curve, the more is the similarity between the two signals.

=== Autocorrelation ===

The term &quot;autocorrelation&quot; is the name of the operation when a function is correlated with itself. The autocorrelation is denoted when both of the subscripts to the Correlation operator are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(t) = x(t) * x(-t)&lt;/math&gt;

While it might seem ridiculous to correlate a function with itself, there are a number of uses for autocorrelation that will be discussed later. Autocorrelation satisfies several important properties:

#The maximum value of the autocorrelation always occurs at ''t = 0''. The function always decreases (or stays constant) as ''t'' approaches infinity. 
#Autocorrelation is symmetric about the ''x'' axis.

=== Crosscorrelation ===

Cross correlation is every instance of correlation that is not considered &quot;autocorrelation&quot;. In general, crosscorrelation occurs when the function arguments to the correlation are not equal. Crosscorrelation is used to find the similarity between two signals.

:&lt;math&gt;R_{gh}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(\tau)h(t + \tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: RADAR ===

{{TextBox|RADAR is a system that uses pulses of electromagnetic waves to determine the position of a distant object. RADAR operates by sending out a signal, and then listening for echos. If there is an object in range, the signal will bounce off that object and return to the RADAR station. The RADAR will then take the cross correlation of two signals, the sent signal and the received signal. A spike in the cross correlation signal indicates that an object is present, and the location of the spike indicates how much time has passed (and therefore how far away the object is).}}</text>

      <comment>/* White Noise */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Signals and Systems Page}}

Noise is an unfortunate phenomenon that is the greatest single enemy of an electrical engineer. Without noise, digital communication rates would increase almost to infinity.

== White Noise (Gaussian Noise) ==

White Noise, or Gaussian Noise is called white because it affects all the frequency components of a signal equally. This noise can be modeled as a Gaussian noise process. Gaussian processes are stochastic processes for which the random variables are jointly Gaussian. We don't talk about Frequency Domain analysis till a later chapter, but it is important to know this terminology now.

== Colored Noise ==

Colored noise is different from white noise in that it affects different frequency components differently. For example, Pink Noise is random noise with an equal amount of power in each frequency octave band.

== White Noise and Autocorrelation ==

White Noise is completely random, so it would make intuitive sense to think that White Noise has zero autocorrelation. As the noise signal is time shifted, there is no correlation between the values. In fact, there is no correlation at all until the point where t = 0, and the noise signal perfectly overlaps itself. At this point, the correlation spikes upward. In other words, the autocorrelation of noise is an [[Signals and Systems/Engineering Functions/Impulse Function|Impulse Function]] centered at the point t = 0.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}[n(t), n(t)] = \delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where n(t) is the noise signal.

== Noise Power ==

Noise signals have a certain amount of energy associated with them. The more energy and transmitted power that a noise signal has, the more interference the noise can cause in a transmitted data signal. We will talk more about the power associated with noise in later chapters.

== Thermal Noise ==

Thermal noise is a fact of life for electronics. As components heat up, the resistance of resistors change, and even the capacitance and inductance of energy storage elements can be affected. This change amounts to noise in the circuit output. In this chapter, we will study the effects of thermal noise.

The ''thermal noise'' or ''white noise'' or ''Johnson noise'' is the random noise which is generated in a resistor or the resistive component of a complex impedance due to rapid and random motion of the molecules, atoms and electrons.
According to the kinetic theory of thermodynamics, the temperature of a particle denotes its internal kinetic energy. This means that the temperature of a body expresses the rms value of the velocity of motion of the particles in a body. As per this kinetic theory, the kinetic energy of these particles becomes approximately zero (i.e. zero velocity) at absolute zero.
Therefore, the noise power produced in a resistor is proportional to its absolute temperature. Also the noise power is proportional to the bandwidth over which the noise is measured.
Therefore the expression for maximum noise power output of a resistor may be given as:
 
:&lt;math&gt;Pn=k \cdot T \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

where
: k is Boltzmann's  constant 
: T is the absolute temperature, in Kelvin degrees
: B is the bandwidth of interest, in Hertz.</text>

== Periodic Signals ==

A signal is a periodic signal if it completes a pattern within a measurable time frame, called a period and repeats that pattern over identical  subsequent periods.  The completion of a full pattern is called a cycle.  A period is defined as the amount of time (expressed in seconds) required to complete one full cycle.  The duration of a period represented by T, may be different for each signal but it is constant for any given periodic signal.

== Terminology ==

We will discuss here some of the common terminology that pertains to a periodic function. Let ''g(t)'' be a periodic function satisfying ''g(t + T) = g(t)'' for all ''t''.

=== Period ===

The '''period''' is the smallest value of ''T'' satisfying ''g(t + T) = g(t)'' for all ''t''. The period is defined so because if ''g(t + T) = g(t)'' for all ''t'', it can be verified that ''g(t + T') = g(t)'' for all ''t'' where ''T' = 2T, 3T, 4T, ...'' 
In essence, it's the smallest amount of time it takes for the function to repeat itself. If the period of a function is finite, the function is called &quot;periodic&quot;. Functions that never repeat themselves have an infinite period, and are known as &quot;aperiodic functions&quot;.

The period of a periodic waveform will be denoted with a capital ''T''. The period is measured in seconds.

=== Frequency ===

The frequency of a periodic function is the number of complete cycles that can occur per second. Frequency is denoted with a lower-case ''f''. It is defined in terms of the period, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

Frequency has units of ''hertz'' or cycle per second.

=== Radial Frequency ===

The radial frequency is the frequency in terms of radians. it is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;

=== Amplitude ===

The amplitude of a given wave is the value of the wave at that point. Amplitude is also known as the &quot;Magnitude&quot; of the wave at that particular point. There is no particular variable that is used with amplitude, although capital A, capital M and capital R are common.

The amplitude can be measured in different units, depending on the signal we are studying. In an electric signal the amplitude will typically be measured in volts. In a building or other such structure, the amplitude of a vibration could be measured in meters.

=== Continuous Signal ===

A continuous signal is a &quot;smooth&quot; signal, where the signal is defined over a certain range. For example, a sine function is a continuous signal, as is an exponential function or a constant function. A portion of a sine signal over a range of time 0 to 6 seconds is also continuous. Examples of functions that are not continuous would be any discrete signal, where the value of the signal is only defined at certain intervals.

=== DC Offset ===

A ''DC Offset'' is an amount by which the average value of the periodic function is not centered around the ''x''-axis.

A periodic signal has a DC offset component if it is not centered about the ''x''-axis. In general, the DC value is the amount that must be subtracted from the signal to center it on the ''x''-axis. by definition:

:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = (1/T)*\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

With ''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' being the DC offset. If ''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'', the function is centered and has no offset.

=== Half-wave Symmetry ===

To determine if a signal with period 2''L'' has half-wave symmetry, we need to examine a single period of the signal. If, when shifted by half the period, the signal is found to be the negative of the original signal, then the signal has half-wave symmetry. That is, the following property is satisfied:

::&lt;math&gt;f (t-L) = - f (t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Half-wave Symmetry.svg|center]]

Half-wave symmetry implies that the second half of the wave is exactly opposite to the first half. A function with half-wave symmetry does not have to be even or odd, as this property requires only that the shifted signal is opposite, and this can occur for any temporal offset. However, it does require that the DC offset is zero, as one half must exactly cancel out the other. If the whole signal has a DC offset, this cannot occur, as when one half is added to the other, the offsets will add, not cancel.

Note that if a signal is symmetric about the the half-period point, it is ''not'' necessarily half-wave symmetric. An example of this is the function ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, periodic on [-1,1), which has no DC offset and odd symmetry about ''t''=0. However, when shifted by 1, the signal is ''not'' opposite to the original signal.

=== Quarter-Wave Symmetry ===

If a signal has the following properties, it is said to quarter-wave symmetric:
*It is half-wave symmetric.
*It has symmetry (odd or even) about the quarter-period point (i.e. at a distance of L/2 from an end or the centre).

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|[[Image:Quarter-wave_Symmetry_Even.svg|center|400px]]
|[[Image:Quarter-wave_Symmetry_Odd.svg|center|400px]]
|-
|'''Even Signal with Quarter-Wave Symmetry'''
|'''Odd Signal with Quarter-Wave Symmetry'''
|}

Any quarter-wave symmetric signal can be made even or odd by shifting it up or down the time axis. A signal does not have to be odd or even to be quarter-wave symmetric, but in order to find the quarter-period point, the signal will need to be shifted up or down to make it so. Below is an example of a quarter-wave symmetric signal (red) that does not show this property without first being shifted along the time axis (green, dashed):

An equivalent operation is shifting the interval the function is defined in. This may be easier to reconcile with the formulae for Fourier series. In this case, the function would be redefined to be periodic on (''-L+&amp;Delta;'',''L+&amp;Delta;''), where &amp;Delta; is the shift distance.

=== Discontinuities ===

'''Discontinuities''' are an artifact of some signals that make them difficult to manipulate for a variety of reasons.

In a graphical sense, a periodic signal has discontinuities whenever there is a vertical line connecting two adjacent values of the signal. In a more mathematical sense, a periodic signal has discontinuities anywhere that the function has an undefined (or an infinite) derivative. These are also places where the function does not have a limit, because the values of the limit from both directions are not equal.

== Common Periodic Signals ==

There are some common periodic signals that are given names of their own. We will list those signals here, and discuss them.

=== Sinusoidal wave ===

The quintessential periodic waveform. These can be either Sine functions, or Cosine Function.




Vp sin ( 2 pie f t )

=== Square Wave ===

The square wave is exactly what it sounds like: a series of rectangular pulses spaced equidistant from each other, each with the same amplitude.

=== Triangle Wave ===

The triangle wave is also exactly what it sounds like: a series of triangles. These triangles may touch each other, or there may be some space in between each wavelength.

=== Example: Sinusoid, Square, and Triangle Waves ===

{{TextBox|Here is an image that shows some of the common periodic waveforms, a sinusoid, a square wave, a triangle wave, and a sawtooth wave.

[[Image:Waveforms.png|400px|center]]
}}

== Classifications ==

Periodic functions can be classified in a number of ways. one of the ways that they can be classified is according to their symmetry. A function may be Odd, Even, or Neither Even nor Odd. All periodic functions can be classified in this way.

=== Even ===

Functions are even if they are symmetrical about the ''y''-axis.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, a cosine function is an even function.

=== Odd ===

A function is odd if it is inversely symmetrical about the ''y''-axis.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = -f(-x)&lt;/math&gt;

The Sine function is an odd function.

=== Neither Even nor Odd ===

Some functions are neither even nor odd. However, such functions can be written as a sum of even and odd functions. Any function ''f(x)'' can be expressed as a sum of an odd function and an even function:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = 1/2 \{f(x) + f(-x)\} + 1/2 \{f(x) - f(-x)\} &lt;/math&gt;

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify that the first component is even and that the second component is odd. Note that the first term is zero for odd functions and that the second term is zero for even functions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Omaha is often played high-low split. The player may use any combination of exactly two holecards and exactly three boardcards for the high hand and another (or the same) combination of exactly two holecards and exactly three boardcards for the low hand.

==Rules==
# All the rules of Omaha apply to Omaha high-low split except as below.
# A qualifier of 8-or-better for low is used. This means to win the low half of the pot, a player’s hand at the showdown must have five cards of different ranks that are an eight or lower in rank. (An ace is the highest card and also the lowest card.) If there is no qualifying hand for low, the best high hand wins the whole pot.

== pipe trick ==

I discovered a little trick. Stop me if you've heard this one before.

Often &quot;normal&quot; links to an article (putting square brackets around the article name)
don't look quite right in normal running text.
The article name includes extra disambiguation stuff before the colon, or inside parentheses, that's a bit jarring.

Adding a single pipe character to the link strips out that extra stuff, leaving the &quot;normal&quot; name, which is very often exactly what we wanted.

2 examples:

# [[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# [[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# [[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Acoustic:Boundary Conditions and Wave Properties|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

# [[w:Hyperion (moon)]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Hyperion (moon)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# [[w:Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''(what people write when they don't know the pipe trick)''
# [[w:Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Hyperion (moon)|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''(what people write when they do know the pipe trick)''

(I wouldn't bother converting from the 2nd form to the more compact 3rd form, since they both look identical to readers, unless I was editing the link anyway.)

Keep on making those good wikibook edits.

== Messageboxes ==

Hey, Kernigh, why are you changing site-wide templates without asking anyone for opinion?

BTW, you are doing strange things, like replacing CSS classes: &quot;notice&quot; and &quot;metadata&quot; (preventing template from being printed) by noneixisting class &quot;top&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

:I did this test, which suggests that &quot;top&quot; works and &quot;notice metadata&quot; does not.

&lt;div class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;top&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;notice&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;metadata&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;notice metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;notice metadata&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

:I thought I was making only minor changes to the templates (though I think that I changed the width of some of them). Was I more &quot;bold&quot; then I should be? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:07, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't see any change made by &quot;top&quot;. When it comes to templates design, your changes are not bad, but I don't understand why you made subst: to {{tl|Message box}}. Take this example - you have to insert &quot;metadata&quot; to large number of templates now, if you had used {{tl|Message box}}, you would have to insert it only once. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:17, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

::: When I use &quot;printable version&quot; from &quot;toolbox&quot;, &quot;top&quot; disappears for me in Konqueror browser, the other three do not. So I tried Firefox browser, where I was not logged in; again &quot;top&quot; disappears but the others do not.

::: Should I set class=&quot;top notice metadata&quot;? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

::: That's strange. I checked this page on three browsers: Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer. All of them displayed only &quot;notice&quot;. I'm sure &quot;metadata&quot; won't be printed, because it is mentioned in [[MediaWiki:Monobook.css]]. I'm only suprised that &quot;top&quot; is not printed, because I can't find it in Monobook and [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]. Nonetheless, because of semantic meaning &quot;metadata&quot; should be used and I don't see any reason for using &quot;top&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:42, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

:: &lt;s&gt;I just noticed that class=&quot;top&quot; is working in the User namespace, but not in the Template namespace.&lt;/s&gt; Further, class=&quot;metadata&quot; only disappears for me if I actually print the page (using print preview), not if I use the &quot;printable versions&quot; link. So it seems that only class=&quot;metadata&quot; will work from templates. I will go change the templates. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:47, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

Test using &quot;center&quot; instead of &quot;div&quot; element: --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:04, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

&lt;center class=&quot;notice metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;notice metadata&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Speedy Delete==
Is there really any discussion page for SD, nothing has ever been discussed on the candidates listing page. You have tagged [[Christianity/Christianity and the world's religions]] for SD. What about the other 19 blank pages on the Main page outline? The outline did not originate with me, but I completed Chapter 1 as I had extra time from working on the Appendix.
Christianity took 2000 years to develop and this hefty overview might take a while. The &quot;no wiki page for this&quot; was just some digital gladiator taking potshots at Christianity, never to return. &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;006633&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00AAAA&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00BBBB&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;00DDDD&quot;&gt;k&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

:Are you familiar with the [[Project:Deletion policy]]? One can speedily delete &quot;a page with no meaningful content&quot;. If there are &quot;other 19 blank pages&quot;, then I missed them because I encountered [[Christianity/Christianity and the world's religions]] by chance.

== Adminship ==

I'm wondering why you still haven't requested for adminship here and noone has nominated you. IMO you're doing lots of cleanup work here and such permissions would allow to make many things easier and faster. You are doing good nominations for speedy deletion, revert vandalism quite often and clean up old pages. It will be your fourth month here. Looking at your contributions, you are a reasonable person so, all in all, I think you are good material for a sysop. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:37, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

:At 28 December 2005, I created [[Bugzilla:4414]]. I had lost the ability to view deleted edit histories. The bug closed with &quot;Please discuss the issue with the enwikibooks community,&quot; at which point I understood that it was not a bug, it was a decision by developers to delegate decisions to communities.

:In January, I started thinking that it would be convenient if I could delete certain pages instead of using {{tl|delete}}. A request for adminship at [[WB:RFA]] is a way for me to ask Wikibookians whether they would let me delete pages and read their histories. I will do a request for adminship when I have time. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:58, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

Just an FYI, but you have been nominated for adminship here on Wikibooks, thanks in large part due to your contributions.  We certainly can use a few more admins here, and I would ask you to accept this nomination if you are interested.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:29, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for your help with deleting the pages I'd merged -- much appreciated! Sorry for the hassle; I should have been more careful.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 03:27, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

:BTW, Kernigh, I hope you know who Bcrowell is likely to be.... Dr. Ben Crowell who wrote the Physics textbook that can be found at http://www.lightandmatter.com/.  If he is contributing to Wikibooks I am incredibly impressed.  I hope this is not a userper of the name but the actual guy.  I hope we can encourage him to continue on Wikibooks but not overwhelm him.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:58, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== [[m:Transwiki:Wikimania05]] ==

I got a major complaint today about the transwiki of this Wikibook to Meta, and the user is so pissed that he invoked Jimbo.  I basically replied &quot;bring it on!  I'd love to see Jimbo try to defend this Wikibook.&quot;

I sorta doubt that Jimbo is going to be so forceful, but I finished off the transwiki yesterday with deleting all of the Wikimania content.  I suggested that he put up a proposal on [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] if he really is that pissed over the whole thing.  This is an FYI because your name is attached to a part of the transwiki to Meta.

I knew I was stepping on some &quot;powerful&quot; toes by doing a transwiki of this content, and I'll see just how independent we as a Wikibooks community really are going to be with this transfer.  This book should not have been here in the first place, and I did complain about it back elsewhen.  I think I have a stronger backbone on this now, and am willing to even go against board members (who BTW encouraged the Wikimania content to be added in the first place to Wikibooks).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
: This was a fair bit of work.  I don't see this as stepping on toes so much as being courteous to current users of the content; replacing this page with a stub that points visitors to the right place (and protecting it), &amp;c.  
: Meta is a fine place to have the proceedings end up.  I am not sure which board members you feel encouraged the proceedings to be added to Wikibooks last summer; I seem to recall it being the book-like nature of traditional conference proceedings that suggested using WB in the first place. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 07:10, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

::The board members who encouraged this to be on Wikibooks were Anthere and Angela.  Both contributed to it here on Wikibooks, and certainly did not raise any objection to it, dispite a strong protest by Aya at the time.  I didn't know that at the time, but after I was about half way through the process of deleting the content did I notice both names on the edit history log of many of the pages, as I noticed yours as well, SJ.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:02, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

---

BTW, I guess I need to thank you at least partically for your defense of my removal of this content.  There are more pages that Brion restored that need to be deleted as well, but you provided a good start.  And thanks for the redirects as well.  I've been a stick in the mud about the redirects mainly because of the &quot;demands&quot; that '''I''' perform the action instead of one of the Wikimania participants stepping in and doing it themselves.  It didn't require sysop privileges to add the redirects.  Thanks anyway, and I hope this whole thing quiets down real soon.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:02, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

==My RFA==
Kernigh. I thought I would write you concerning my RFA. I thought I would ask (and hope) that you would reconsider your vote of Oppose. While I know my contributions weighs heavy to my own project, if you look closely you will see where I have contributed to other projects (primarily with suggestions and comments.) I have taken your advice and began watching the locations you have suggested. I will admit I am not a die hard vandal hunter, I feel I can be an asset in taking what I've learned from Wikibooks and help others to improve their materials. I guess I could become a major vandal hunter if that's what it takes to help others with development, but I feel that my assistance in the area of development would be my strength. I completely understand if you choose not to, but I thought I would at least ask for your consideration. Thanks.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 10:00, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

Over there, the tag for speedies is {{tl|csd}} and has to meet certain requirements, some of which are fairly contreversial and undefined.

== [[Lord of the Flies]] and failed Google test ==

I've gone through the history of the content for this Wikibook, and I am convinced that the bundle of other web pages are all copies of the content that was originally developed here on Wikibooks.  The first edit was done back in April 2004 (almost two years ago) and subsequent additions of content was very piecemeal with almost 300 different unique edits to this page.  While there may have been some recent additions that did copy from perhaps previous copyrighted material, this Wikibook doesn't seem to be the problem here.  Instead, I think these other websites are violating '''our''' copyright at Wikibooks, for failure to disclose the GFDL and acknowledging that Wikibooks is the ''source'' of this material.

I'd like to dig up some more information about this, but I think you found a really good copyright violation I'd like to hand over to the Wikimedia legal team.  I'm sure a couple of appropriate letters sent to a couple of website owners about misuse of Wikibooks content....  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:05, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== RuneScape Cheats ==

Hey man. In votes for deletion, you said this about the RuneScape Cheats article.

The bot community is trying [http://www.aryanrune.com/terms.html to make contractually illegal the informing of JAGex or the public about bots]; maybe we should mention that somewhere in the book.

I don't fully understand what you're saying there. Can you go further into detail please?? Richard 01:37, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

: To write a Wikibook module about RuneScape cheating robots, or to verify that the mentioned bots actually exist, one would need to research them. However at this time I guess that JAGeX has suppressed most cheating bots, and their remaining users are hiding behind forums such as aryanrune, and applying terms of use that impede anyone from describing these bots in public.

: The most problematic part of their terms reads, ''In these Terms and Conditions &quot;images&quot; refers to the images used by the domain and host of AryanRune.com. To view any image on fagex.net or its server that it is hosted on, '''you must not be in any way affiliated with Jagex Ltd you must not be affiliated with RuneScape''' and/or Employed by either. / Viewing the images on the site means you are in no way trying to '''report''', send, capture or scan this sites server or images.''

: For now, I ignore the difference between AryanRune.com and fagex.net. These terms not only bar JAGeX/RuneScape from accessing the &quot;images&quot;, they also bar third parties &amp;ndash; such as Wikibook authors &amp;ndash; from describing (&quot;report&quot;) the contents of the images.

: However, it is also possible that I only misinterpreted the terms. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

K but I got another question for you.

==[[Mythology/Greek Mythology]] and [[Greek Mythology]]==
Hi, back in February, you expressed a desire to merge these two books together.

The only pages that still need to be merged are [[Talk:Mythology/Greek Mythology]] and [[Talk:Greek Mythology]]. Now the only issue that remains is whether the book should be part of [[Mythology]] or stand on its own. I'll leave that up to you to decide.

Man, I need some help with this page. It gets vandilized every fricken day. Retards remove whole sections and put swears all over it.

But before this, I was wondering if maybe you could do something about, like make it on a 'high risk for vandilism' or something that can keep it watched often. It's just so annoying to see everyday that someone messed up the page. Thanks for the help you've done before, and maybe you could do this last thing.

Oh, and can it be renamed to [[RuneScape/Guides/Item Price Guide]]? Thanks. Richard 12:58, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Page moves ==
What is it with these odd page-moves?? --[[User:TurretTower|TurretTower]] 15:18, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

: Vandalism. If you see any more vandal page-moves, you can report them to [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:48, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

== Vandalism attack on our user pages ==

I just reverted some vandalism by an idiot who moved both of our user pages and user talk pages.  I put them back, but I also added move protection, and even edit protection on the main user page.  You are certainly welcome to reverse that for your own page, but I felt that would be a good general protection to you in this situation, especially since you have admin authority anyway to do what you want on these pages.  I want to nail this idiot, and I want to thank you for bringing up the current discussion on Foundation-l.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:37, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

I share my IP address with these vandals. Ignore them... they'll get bored like most Wiki-vandals do! --[[User:TurretTower|TurretTower]] 14:55, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

== DickyRobert? ==

On my talk page, I got a DickyRobert template. What the heck is it? Can it be removed? --Richard 00:28, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

: It was vandalism; you can revert it. It looks like [[User:Robert Horning]] already reverted the template and blocked that vandal. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:32, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Embassy and technical help ==

Kernigh,

I started an [[English Embassy]] page, which is pretty much a copy of the english wikipedia's embassy page. I was wondering, if it should be [[Wikibooks:English Embassy]] instead, or anything like that. Also, I would like to ask people who speak other languages if they would like to list themselves on the page, to be available for any non-english speaking people who would need help- I was wondering, should I look at the different language categories and ask people on their personal page, or just post on the staff lounge?(I don't want to keep posting stuff there every day if it isn't appropriate)

Also, I have been preparing to contribute to the [[Russian]] Language wikibook, but don't know much about using templates and making boxes(you know, the things that make wikibooks look pretty). I was wondering, are there people out there who can make a bland wikibook look better as content is being added, based on the needs of the wikibook? Maybe I should ask about it in the staff lounge too, I don't know. I basically am asking you this because you seem to know what you're doing more than anyone else here. Thanks in advance, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 19:58, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

==[[:Image:Wikiversity-logo-zs.png]]==
I clarified the legalities of the licensing issue at Wikipedia commons for [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikiversity-logo-zs.png Wikiversity-logo-zs.png]. I hope this helps.

Basically, the licensing is the only thing that matters. The owner can grant as many licenses to use his image as he wants. Each license can have its own stipulations. He granted one license to the world under the GNU FDL and another license to me to make the logo. The logo license was issued separately and directly from the owner, and is therefore not subject to the GNU FDL. For that reason, I can grant propriety rights to the logo to the Wikimedia foundation. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 16:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

== Videogame transwikiing method ==

In various postings you've mentioned your search for a transwikiing aid. [[mw:MWDumper|MWDumper]] seems to be the answer. It can search an archive and extract pages based on a filter list, so all you need is a full dump. I've been testing its accuracy and so far I haven't come across any problems.

This is the tool StrategyWiki is going to use, and I've already begun creating [http://strategywiki.net/wiki/StrategyWiki:Wikibooks_Import_List automated filters] for it to aid transwikiing. These are written in a compatible raw format; they can be pasted straight into a .txt for MWDumper's consumption. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:08, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
:Actually, what I am interested in is a way to remove guides from this wiki, Wikibooks, after transwiki. Currently, if we move a guide to Strategy Wiki or elsewhere, then it is a fork; a copy remains at Wikibooks. I would like to have a Wikibooks policy that allows us to delete these guides.
:[[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] already allows us to use {{tl|transwiki}} to delete stuff, but that only applies for transwikis to other Wikimedia projects. However, if most Wikibookians support it, then we can change the deletion policy to let us delete moved computer and video game guides. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
::Oh, now I get what you're talking about! Well, I can't see anything like that being passed through any time soon what with all this chaos. In the meantime you could list them on Vfd. Since they now breach [[WB:WIW]] (or at least Jimbo's revision of it) the lack of a matching clause in the deletion policy is immaterial. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:10, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:35, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

==empty pages==
well, to tell the truth, i didnt understand anything you said, sorry. but i didnt create empty pages.... if you go to edit, youll see that stuff is there, i just havent added all the data yet, so i hid the stuff with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;--!&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; so that it would be easier to add all the data later.... but thanks for deleting them without talking to me first... thatll be a biiiigg help... -[[User:Xornok|Xornok]] 13:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

==Reply from Yunzhong Hou==

Thanks for replying to the discussion page on the StarCraft Wikibook. You are the first person since my series of revisions to leave a comment, and I was becoming desperate. 

I would like to point out to you that my High Templar page on Wikipedia is more than a 'poorly written article'; it survived the Deletion proposal by overwhelming votes, and many of the voters agreed with me that the StarCraft articles should be transferred to Wikibooks because doing so will make the subject's various pages more coherent. Although the task is daunting, I have already transwikified my High Templar page and many others. 

However, I do agree with you that some components of the page are a bit irrelevant or crude, in which case I would be happy to make any changes that you deem important. If you can, please find people who may be interested in editing the StarCraft Wikibook. I know only a few Wikipedes. Thanks! --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 02:40, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

== Templates vs. screenshots ==

Hello there.  You were the one who initially spoke to me about the [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)]] book and ways to go about doing it.  I've done some more work on it and I wanted to ask you:  I've come up with a new template to assist in the guide.  What I was doing before was posting screenshots, but using the template I can lay out things and hopefully eliminate screenshots.  My question is:  What is better?  The template of the screenshots?  The template could be applied to future books, though the screenshots are quick and simple.

* One page that is using the new template is [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 3|This one]]
* One page that is using the screenshot system is [[Adventures of Lolo 2 (Japanese)/Level 2|This one]]

I would like to hear from you about your opinion as you are an administrator and I don't want to get ahead of myself.  Thank you.  --[[User:Sivak|Sivak]] 05:42, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

==Vicious circle==

I noticed that on [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] you seemed to support enforcement. There is a vicious circle occurring in Wikibooks Policies where the absence of an accepted policy on voting (see [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]]) can be used to prevent votes from becoming enforced. It seems to me that unless we get [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] enforced we cannot get any other policy enforced. This is fine for the moment but I have looked over the wall at Wikipedia....  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

: I commented on '''[[Wikibooks talk:No personal attacks]]''', where I wrote, &quot;I prefer that we have only one policy to deal with user behaviour (limiting insults against users, implementing consistent voting rules, resolving various disputes) instead of creating so many pages.&quot; --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:27, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;accredited institution&quot; ==

You might want to read the comments I left for Rob at [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#How_To_Build_A_Pykrete_Bong]]. It seems WMF is not internally consistent about its mission for WB. Jimbo obviously has a particular view and could likely make that WMF policy, but it is definitely not 100% clear. I assume you've also read [[w:User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Wikibooks_Howtos]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:47, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:05, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

== votes for deletion ==

Kernigh, could you look at [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Technical_Analysis]] and [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#New_Zealand_Economics]], I'd really like to clean up the [[Wikibooks:Business and economics bookshelf|Business and economics bookshelf]].

== XML/Firefox ==

Thanks for answering my question at the help desk. Your second idea sounds viable, but once I get the page, I have no idea how to selectively take out say the premieres for October 25th or something (or to make it easier, the first five lines). And none of the tutorials I read help me. They all assume the site has an RSS feed or are already written in XML in which case isolating information is a breeze, just include one link in your code. How do you import selected text from HTML sources into a firefox extension? - [[User:131.211.210.16|131.211.210.16]] 07:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;

== Blender Dokumentation seems to use non-GFDL license ==

Hallo Kernigh, 
I've written a comment on http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer_Diskussion:Kernigh regarding the topic. In short: no, http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_Dokumentation is not a copy of http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual.de/Handbuch, but I've written text as well for de.wikibooks.org as for mediawiki.blender.org. http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Soylentgreen

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the structure of a typical build.xml file:

   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
   &lt;project name=&quot;MyFirstAntProject&quot; default=&quot;MyTarget&quot;&gt;
      &lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
         &lt;echo&gt;Running target init&lt;/echo&gt;
      &lt;/target&gt;
      &lt;target name=&quot;MyTarget&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
         &lt;echo&gt;Running target MyTarget&lt;/echo&gt;
      &lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/project&gt;

Here are a few things to note:

# The Begin and End tags for project (&lt;project&gt; and &lt;/project&gt;) MUST start and end the file.
# The Begin &lt;project&gt; MUST have an attribute called default which is the name of one of the targets.
# Each build file must have at least one target.
# The Begin and End tags for &lt;target&gt; and &lt;/target&gt; must also match EXACTLY.
# Each target MUST have a name.
# Targets depend only on other targets and reference them by their target name.  Targets NEVER depend on projects or tasks.
# Target depends are optional.
# Anything between &lt;echo&gt; and &lt;/echo&gt; tags is outputted to the console if the surrounding target is called.
# Every task has to be in a target.

You can execute this from a DOS or UNIX command prompt by creating a file called build.xml and typing:

   ant

Ant will search for the build file in the current directory and run the build.xml file.

Here is a sample output of this build:

   Buildfile: C:\AntClass\Lab01\build.xml
   init:
        [echo] Running target init
   MyTarget:
        [echo] Running target MyTarget
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 188 milliseconds

Optionally you can also pass ant the name of the target to run as a command line argument

   ant init

Which triggers only the init target

   Buildfile: C:\AntClass\Lab01\build.xml
   init:
        [echo] Running target init
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 188 milliseconds

I am trying to rethink how children learn history.  Instead of taking the easy way out, and following chronology, I am trying to think about what is really important.  

I've written so far about the big changes in history.  I think the next thing to write about is the Twentieth Century.  I remember taking &quot;modern history&quot; in college, and being disappointed because we never got to the Twentieth Century.  For a long time, I knew more about ancient Babylon than I knew about World War I.  I think kids want to know (and need to know) about the history their fathers and mothers and grandparents lived through. [[User:Rick Norwood|Rick Norwood]] 20:25, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

Hi, I stumbled across this page and I think it was done very well! The only thing was that the format was a little bit intimidating, so I broke it down into smaller bits to make it easier to read. If there is any problem with how I edited things feel free to revert it. --[[User:Sanitized|Sanitized]] ([[User talk:Sanitized|talk]]) 19:13, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

I would like to re-start this project. I am thinking of adding broad topics first (i.e. methods and uses of history research, philosophy of history and history of human society). Focusing, like the original author of the project, on the non-linear presentation of history.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The discussion of user defined types should come before that of using classes and objects, as they are conceptually and programmatically much simpler to use. 

There should primarily be discussion of the 'dot' notation, perhaps even before anything else, as the notation is used without explanation in previous pages. In fact the dot notation can be used to identify both UDTs and Objects in VB.

It should also be shown what Object type variables actually are: that is, pointers to memory.  This will help explain how Objects are passed by reference (or by value) to functions and what happens when you assign one object to another.

Examples of some common VB objects you might use in a program (such as the Debug object or Controls on a Form or Collections), should be given.

How to write a class from scratch should then be discussed; and how these objects can be instantiated and how object lifetimes (reference counting) works in practice.  This will include such areas as the prefered use of the New keyword and what happens when Object variables go out of scope and with circular references.

Lastly the use of visibility of functions (methods) and variables or properties (properties), and the difference between Private, Public and Friend keywords.

Some advanced topics (maybe for other sections) should include authoring DLLs, COM objects (and GUIDs), default methods (and the use of the 'bang' ! operator) and enumerators (for use in For Each loops).

I shall write some of this perhaps, when I have some time...

      <text xml:space="preserve">For reversing a string, very slightly optimized version from that given would be:

 Private Function ReverseStr(ByVal IPStr As String) As String
   Dim i As Integer
   For i = 1 To Len(IPStr)
     ReverseStr = Mid$(IPStr, i, 1) &amp; ReverseStr
   Next
 End Function

The changes are that the index (i) goes forward instead of backwards.  But the characters are added backwards instead of forwards.

If you really want to optimize it, create the string once with the proper length, so it is only allocated once. The above code would mean one (behind-the-scenes) call to SysReAllocString per loop iteration. Like this...

 Private Function ReverseStr(ByVal IPStr As String) As String
   Dim i As Long, j As Long, n As Long
   n = Len(IPStr)
   j = n
   ReverseStr = Space$(n)
   For i = 1 To Len(IPStr)

Hello Sir
Since you are in contact with experts in computer programming, I kindly ask you for TWO favors: 
FIRST: I want to build an application having a command button that can connect me through my modem to my ISP: IDM. Please, can you tell me what are the instructions that must be put in the code of the cmd if I am using Visual Basic 6.0???

SECOND: If I want to load the Dial-up connection in the Network Connections folder, I cannot construct the path that I should include in the &quot;Shell&quot; instruction. What is the path to the Dial-up connection?
 
Your help is highly appreciated and I thank you in advance.
Best Regards
Please e-mail me the answer if you don't mind

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sfarsaii. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sfarsaii~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

= Subderivations and Discharge Rules =

As already seen, we need three more inference rules, Conditional Introduction (CI), Negation Introduction (NI), and Negation Elimination (NE).  These require subderivations.

== Deriving conditionals ==

=== Example derivation ===

We begin with an example derivation which illustrates Conditional Introduction.  We will provide a derivation for the argument

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R},\ \mathrm{S} \land \mathrm{Q}\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Lines 3 and 4 constitute a subderivation.  It starts by assuming desired formula's antecedent and ends by deriving the desired formula's consequent.  There are two vertical fences between the line numbers and the formulae to set it off from the rest of the derivation and to indicate its subordinate status.  Line 3 has a horizontal fence under it to separate the assumption from the rest of the subderivation.  Line 5 is the application of Conditional Introduction.  It follows not from one or two lines but from the subderivation (lines 3&amp;ndash;4) as a whole.

Conditional Introduction is a ''discharge rule''.  It discharges (makes inactive) that assumption and indeed makes the entire subderivation inactive.  Once we applyed a discharge rule, no line from the subderivaiton (here, lines 3 and 4) can be further used in the derivation.

=== The Conditional Introduction rule ===

Conditional Introduction (CI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{Assume\ \varphi,\ derive\ \psi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the consequent line is not inferred from one or more antecedent lines, but from a subderivation as a whole.  The annotation is the range of lines occupied by the subderivation and the abbreviation CI.  Note that the antecedent subderivation can consist of a single line serving both as the assumed &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the derived &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as in the following derivation of

: '''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| 1. 
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;

| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;10px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 1 CI
|-
|}
|}


Unlike previously introduced inference rules, Conditional Introduction cannot be justified by a truth table.  Rather it is justified by the Deduction Principle introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Deduction principle|Properties of Sentential Connectives]].

== Negations ==

=== Example derivation ===

To illustrate Negation Introduction, we will provide a derivation for the argument

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R},\ \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Lines 3 through 6 constitute a subderivation.  It starts by assuming the desired formula's opposite and ends by assuming a contradiction (a formula and its negation).  As before, there are two vertical fences between the line numbers and the formulae to set it off from the rest of the derivation and to indicate its subordinate status.  And the horizontal fence under line 3 again separates the assumption from the rest of the subderivation.  Line 7, which follows from the entire subderivation, is the application of Negation Introduction.

At line 9, note that the annotation '5 DI' would be incorrect.  Although inferring &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is valid by DI, line 5 is no longer active when we get to line 9.  Thus we are not allowed to derive anything from line 5 at that point.

=== The Negation Introduction rule ===

Negation Introduction (NI)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{Assume\ \varphi,\ derive\ \psi\ and\ \lnot \psi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The consequent line is inferred from the whole subderivation.  The annotation is the range of lines occupied by the subderivation and the abbreviation is NI.  Negation Introduction sometimes goes by the Latin name ''Reductio ad Absurdum'' or sometimes by ''Proof by Contradiction''.

Like Conditional Introduction, Negation Introduction cannot be justified by a truth table.  Rather it is justified by the Reductio Principle introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Deduction principle|Properties of Sentential Connectives]].

=== Another example derivation ===

To illustrate Negation Elimination, we will provide a derivation for the argument

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot( \lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{R}\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Lines 2 through 4 constitute a subderivation.  As in the previous example, it starts by assuming the desired formula's opposite and ends by assuming a contradiction (a formula and its negation).  Line 5, which follows from the entire subderivation, is the application of Negation Elimination.

=== The Negation Elimination rule ===

Negation Elimination (NE)
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{Assume\ \lnot \varphi,\ derive\ \psi\ and\ \lnot \psi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The consequent line is inferred from the whole subderivation.  The annotation is the range of lines occupied by the subderivation and the abbreviation is NE.  Like Negation Introduction, Negation Elimination sometimes goes by the Latin name ''Reductio ad Absurdum'' or sometimes by ''Proof by Contradiction''.

Like Negation Introduction, Negation Elimination is justified by the Reductio Principle introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Deduction principle|Properties of Sentential Connectives]].  This rule's place in the Introduction/Elimination naming convention is somewhat more awkward than for the other rules.  Unlike the other elimination rules, the negation that gets eliminated by this rule does not occur in an already derived line.  Rather the eliminated negation occurs in the assumption of the subderivation.

== Terminology ==

The inference rules introduced in this module, Conditional Introduction and Negation Introduction, are discharge rules.  For lack of a better term, we can call the inference rules introduced in [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Inference Rules|Inference Rules]] 'standard rules'.  A ''standard rule'' is an inference rule whose antecedent is a set of lines.  A ''discharge rule'' is an inference rule whose antecedent is a subderivation.

The ''depth'' of a line in a derivation is the number of fences standing between the line number and the formula.  All lines of a derivation have a depth of at least one.  Each temporary assumption increases the depth by one.  Each discharge rule decreases the depth by one.

An ''active line'' is a line that is available for use as an antecedent line for a standard inference rule.  In particular, it is a line whose depth is less than or equal to the depth of the current line.  An inactive line is a line that is not active.

A discharge rule is said to ''discharge'' an assumption.  It makes all lines in its antecedent subderivation inactive.</text>

{{Wikipedia|COBOL}}

COBOL is a computer programming language whose name is an acronym formed by the upper-case letters of the words &quot;COmmon Business-Oriented Language&quot;.  It is widely used in the financial services industry typically for mainframe based applications. It has been used extensively since the 1960s. COBOL was designed for use in business applications and consequently it was implemented with fixed-point arithmetic support. This is one of the advantages of COBOL as it allows complete and accurate computation of financial values without the possibility of rounding errors.

===Type===
COBOL is a full procedural language.

===Execution Entry Point===

A COBOL program is split into four '''divisions''', all four divisions must be present in every program in this sequence: Identification; Environment; Data and Procedure. Each division contains a number of mandatory and optional '''sections''' and '''paragraphs'''.

The '''Identification Division''' contains information about the program, including its name, author, date of compilation, etc. It must contain the &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM-ID&lt;/code&gt; paragraph which uniquely names the program. All other paragraphs are optional.

The '''Environment Division''' describes the environment in which the program will execute. For example, it includes details of input and output files and the target execution platform. The division contains two sections: the '''Configuration Section''' and the '''Input-Output section'''. 

The '''Data Division''' contains the '''File Section''', which fully describes the record layout of each input and output file, and the '''Working-Storage Section''' where variables are declared. It also contains the '''Linkage Section''' which describes data that will be passed between programs that call each other.

The '''Procedure Division''' contains the executable program instructions. The execution entry point is the first statement in the division.

===General Syntax===
It would be very difficult to give an overview of COBOL's general syntax, since the language has over 500 reserved words.  Moreover, the syntax (like other early languages, including FORTRAN) is not designed to follow a formal grammar; for this reason COBOL and FORTRAN parsers are rarely implemented using automatic code generators.

Here are some sample assignment statements:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 MOVE A TO B.
 COMPUTE GROSS-PAY = HOURS-WORKED * HOURLY-RATE
 MULTIPLY HOURLY-RATE BY HOURS-WORKED GIVING GROSS-PAY
 SET MY-INDEX TO 1

 SET ADDRESS OF MY-LINKAGE-SECTION-ITEM TO MY-POINTER
 READ TRANSACTION-FILE INTO TRANSACTION-RECORD-WS
&lt;/source&gt;

While many sites still use all uppercase characters, modern COBOL compilers are case-insensitive.  The following two statements are absolutely equivalent:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 MOVE MY-NUMBER TO YOUR-NUMBER.
 Move my-number to Your-Number.
&lt;/source&gt;

Character case is respected for quoted literals (character strings).

===Comments===
Normally the only way to specify a comment is by putting an asterisk in the indicator-area (column 7).  The entire line is a comment.  Block comments must have * in column 7 of every line.  There is a 2002 standard that allows part of a line to be a comment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 MOVE A TO B.   *&gt; THIS IS A COMMENT ON THE SAME LINE AS A STATEMENT
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
There are a few variables of a type known as special registers that do not need to be defined, but generally all variables must be defined in COBOL, unlike interpreted BASIC.

COBOL has a number of data types, but the most common are numeric (with specifiers for internal format), numeric edited data, alphanumeric data, and records (similar to structs in C):
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 01  TRANSACTION-RECORD.
    05  RECORD-NUMBER            PICTURE S9(7) COMP-3 VALUE ZERO.
    05  RECORD-DESCRIPTION       PICTURE X(30) VALUE SPACES.
    05  EDITED-AMOUNT            PIC $$$$,$$$,$$$.99-.
    05  FILLER                   PIC X(60) VALUE SPACES.
&lt;/source&gt;

Your simple example, declaring an integer, might look something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 77  I    pic s9(4)  usage is binary.
&lt;/source&gt;

COBOL also supports redefinition, which is somewhat similar to union in C.

==Method Declaration/Implementation==
Object-oriented extensions are available to COBOL, but the vast majority of COBOL programmers don't know them, and see no need for them.

However if a COBOL programer wants to create a class it is quite easy.  For example here is an HelloWorld class with an InstanceMethod!
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
       class-id. HelloWorld as &quot;HelloWorld&quot;.
       environment division.
       configuration section.
       repository.
      
       object.
       data division.
       working-storage section.

       method-id. &quot;InstanceMethod&quot;.
       local-storage section.
       linkage section.
       procedure division.
           display &quot;Hello World&quot;
           exit method.           
       end method &quot;InstanceMethod&quot;.
      
       end object.
       end class HelloWorld
&lt;/source&gt;

If the COBOL programmer wants to interact with external classes such as the .NET Framework it can do too. For example here is a example of obtaining the current date/time from .NET.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
        procedure division.
           declare now = type System.DateTime::Now
           display now
&lt;/source&gt;

===Scope===
All data contained working-storage section of the COBOL program is global.  Some data items may be defined as external, and visible to other programs in a load module. The data items in a COBOL subprogram are global to the subprogram, but local since the caller cannot see them.  Typically, data is &quot;passed&quot; from a COBOL main program to a subprogram by reference.  There are alternatives of &quot;by content&quot; or &quot;by value&quot;, but they are typically only used to call subprograms written in C or other languages that do not normally use call by reference.

Some vendors provide extensions, such as thread-local-storage section and local-storage section.   These extensions allow data to scoped as either thread-local or temporary to the program.

===Conditional Statements===
There are a lot of them.  Here are some examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 If my-number is numeric
    continue
 else
    display 'data field &quot;my-number&quot; is not numeric'
 end-if

 evaluate record-type
 when 'a'
    perform process-record-type-a
 when 'b'
    perform process-record-type-b
 when 'c'
    continue
 when 'd'
 when 'e'
    perform process-record-type-d-or-e
 when other
    perform process-invalid-record-type
 end-evaluate

 READ TRANSACTION-FILE INTO MY-TRAN-REC-WS
 AT END
    SET ALL-RECORDS-PROCESSED TO TRUE
 NOT AT END
    ADD +1 TO TRAN-REC-COUNT
    PERFORM PROCESS-1-TRANSACTION
 END-READ
&lt;/source&gt;
===Looping Statements===
There are several of those too:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 Perform 6 times
    add +1 to loop-count
 end-perform

 Perform process-1-billing-record
    until all-records-processed

 Perform clear-1-table-entry
    varying tbl-index from +1 by +1
    until tbl-index is greater than max-table-entries

 Search table-entry varying tbl-index
 at end
    set entry-not-found to true
 when table-key equal customer-id
    move tbl-customer-name to print-customer-name
 end-search
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output Statements===
Here are several examples.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 DISPLAY &quot;Hello, World!&quot; 
 display 'hello, world!' with no advancing

 Write billing-record from transaction-record-ws
&lt;/source&gt;

For key-sequenced files, there is support for &lt;code&gt;START&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REWRITE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt;.

===Containers===
Not applicable to COBOL.

===Algorithms===
Recursion is not generally supported, although it can be simulated by iteration.

===Garbage collection===
Memory allocated dynamically via system APIs such as malloc should be free'ed with the appriopiate call to &quot;free&quot;.

COBOL programs that uses CLASS'es may need to invoke the &quot;finalize&quot; method to release the object.
For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cobol&quot;&gt;
 invoke myObject &quot;finalize&quot; returning myObject 
&lt;/source&gt;

If the COBOL application is executing under a VM such as a Java VMs or Microsoft's CLR standard garbage collection rules apply.

Otherwise..

COBOL programmers do not normally know or care what garbage collection is.  They rarely have to allocate memory or clean it up afterwards.

===Physical Structure===
A COBOL source file may have (but need not have) copybooks, somewhat similar to .h files in C.  The compiled program generally makes use of a COBOL runtime library of service routines that are dynamically loaded.  The COBOL source file itself consists of four divisions:  &lt;code&gt;IDENTIFICATION DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ENVIRONMENT DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DATA DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE DIVISION&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Willingness is an active form of acceptance. It is accepting the need for action and taking that action. It is not necessarily going along with whatever the therapist or skills trainer thinks is best. Willingness does not demand that reality be something other than what it is. On the other hand willingness does not give up and refuse to take action that could change reality for the better in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dominance training is a controversial method of training dogs. While it has many proponents, it is often considered outdated and potentially harmful by many dog behaviorists and trainers. It is a theory that believes that the key to a well behaved dog is to be in charge of them, and not the other way around.  The practice tries to emulate the way another dog would do it, mostly through body language -- not speech as most people use.  Dogs rarely bark at each other to show dominance, they bark when excited, afraid, or angry.  But the way we control dogs is primarily by &quot;barking&quot; orders to them using complex language, which they don't understand as readily and therefore don't accept our dominance as readily. Those who practice dominance training think using mostly body language is a much more direct and native language for dogs to understand. 

Dominance training theory holds that dominance training should be done on all dogs, regardless of their breed because it can be used to treat all kinds of behavior problems. Those who oppose dominance training theory hold that dominance tactics are often harmful, that dominance tactics can make an aggressive dog more aggressive and a fearful dog more fearful, and that other techniques have been shown to be more effective for basic training in any dog, for correcting bad behavior in any dog, and for rehabilitating problem dogs.

The following is a list of methods or desired behaviors embraced by dominance theory proponents, some of which are considered effective and some of which are considered harmful under other theories of dog behavior and training:

* have them allow you to take food or toys away from them; you give them back, but they should accept your taking them and not growl

* you should walk through doors first

* you should always eat before your dog; let them smell that you are eating, but do not share (do not tease either of course)

* you can nuzzle your dog's nose, head, neck, body, in almost grooming motions, much like a parent dog would do to their puppy to clean them

* you can kiss your dog all over

* petting your dog on the top of their head (they generally don't like that)

* playing with and gently pulling your dogs ears

* playing with their feet

* when your dog is standing or sitting, put your hand over your dog's paw so you are standing on it (but not putting pressure on it of course, just the act of covering it)

* when your dog is standing on all fours, stand behind your dog with your hands on their hips, and your legs against the back of their legs; when they accept that, then add a repeating knee bend, vaguely simulating the motion that another dog who mounted this dog would be doing

* gently bite your dog's neck, arms, and legs

* nibble on your dogs fur as if a parent dog picking out bugs or ticks; watch your dog nibble on their own fur to observe the motion

* open your mouth wide and put it over the top of your dog's lengthwise (not front on) nose (again, just like another dog would)

* when your dog is standing, stand to the side of your dog, kneel down, and grab the bottom of the further two legs away from you and pull them towards you; the dog will gently tip over and be forced to lay down in a submissive position; continue to hold the front and back legs that you grabbed; make sure it is a soft surface like grass or carpet so the dog does not get hurt when falling, and perform gently

* put your dog belly up and sit on them straddled; their back legs should be behind you, not under or in front of you, and you should not allow them to kick you

* when straddling your dog, expose their neck fully.  to do this, tip the bottom of their mouth up so that their forehead is pressing against the floor and their entire neck is exposed and stretched out and available to you, facing up; they should hold that position

* growl at your dog, especially if they approach you while you are eating or beg (dominant dogs will not let other dogs get too close to them when they are eating)

* use a gentle leader leash, which simulates another dog putting their mouth over your dog's mouth

* put your hand(s) over the top of your dog's mouth like a muzzle

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Danny Wilde. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Danny Wilde~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[w:HDV|WikiPedia article on HDV]]

==HDV vs DVCproHD==
DVCproHD will probably produce better results than HDV.  DVCproHD uses a chroma subsampling of 4:2:2 (i.e. it records a full-resolution lumanance image and a half-resolution colour image) whilst HDV uses 4:2:0.

DVCproHD also uses a much higher bitrate (100Mbps) than HDV (25Mbps).  But that doesn't mean that DVCproHD will be 4 times &quot;better&quot; than HDV.  HDV is a more efficient codec than DVCproHD.  And, if you're shooting at 24fps then you actually throw away a lot of DVCproHD's data.

There's an intersting discussion of HDV in comparison to other HD formats on episode 2 of the recent Creative Cow podcasts:

== Analysis Methods ==

When circuits get large and complicated, it is useful to have various methods for simplifying and analyzing the circuit. There is no perfect formula for solving a circuit. Depending on the type of circuit, there are different methods that can be employed to solve the circuit. Some methods might not work, and some methods may be very difficult in terms of long math problems. Two of the most important methods for solving circuits are '''Nodal Analysis''', and '''Mesh Current Analysis'''. These will be explained below.

== Superposition ==

One of the most important principals in the field of circuit analysis is the principal of '''superposition'''. It is valid only in linear circuits. 

{{TextBox|''The '''superposition principle''' states that the total effect of multiple contributing sources on a linear circuit is equal to the sum of the individual effects of the sources, taken one at a time.''}}

What does this mean? In plain English, it means that if we have a circuit with multiple sources, we can &quot;turn off&quot; all but one source at a time, and then investigate the circuit with only one source active at a time. We do this with every source, in turn, and then add together the effects of each source to get the total effect. Before we put this principle to use, we must be aware of the underlying mathematics. 

=== Necessary Conditions ===

Superposition can only be applied to '''linear''' circuits; that is, all of a circuit's sources hold a linear relationship with the circuit's responses. Using only a few algebraic rules, we can build a mathematical understanding of superposition.  If ''f'' is taken to be the response, and ''a'' and ''b'' are constant, then:

:&lt;math&gt;f(ax_1+bx_2)= f(ax_1) + f(bx_2) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of a circuit, it clearly explains the concept of superposition; each input can be considered individually and then summed to obtain the output. With just a few more algebraic properties, we can see that superposition cannot be applied to non-linear circuits.  In this example, the response ''y'' is equal to the square of the input x, i.e. y=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''a'' and ''b'' are constant, then:

:&lt;math&gt;y=(ax_1+bx_2)^2 \ne (ax_1)^2 + (bx_2)^2 = y_1+y_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is only one of an infinite number of counter-examples...

=== Step by Step ===

Using superposition to find a given output can be broken down into four steps:

#Isolate a source - Select a source, and set all of the remaining sources to zero.  The consequences of &quot;turning off&quot; these sources are explained in [[Circuit_Theory/Circuit_Basics#Open_and_Closed_Circuits|Open and Closed Circuits]].  In summary, turning off a voltage source results in a short circuit, and turning off a current source results in an open circuit. (Reasoning - no current can flow through a open circuit and there can be no voltage drop across a short circuit.)  
#Find the output from the isolated source - Once a source has been isolated, the response from the source in question can be found using any of the techniques we've learned thus far.  
#Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each source - Continue to choose a source, set the remaining sources to zero, and find the response.  Repeat this procedure until every source has been accounted for.
#Sum the Outputs - Once the output due to each source has been found, add them together to find the total response.

== Impulse Response ==

An '''impulse response''' of a circuit can be used to determine the output of the circuit:

[[Image:System Block.svg|400px|center]]

The output y is the '''convolution''' h * x of the input x and the impulse response:

{{eqn|Convolution}}
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = (h*x)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} h(t-s)x(s)ds&lt;/math&gt;.

If the input, x(t), was an '''impulse''' (&lt;math&gt;\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt;), the output y(t) would be equal to h(t).

By knowing the impulse response of a circuit, any source can be plugged-in to the circuit, and the output can be calculated by convolution.

== Convolution ==

The '''convolution operation''' is a very difficult, involved operation that combines two equations into a single resulting equation. Convolution is defined in terms of a definite integral, and as such, solving convolution equations will require knowledge of integral calculus. This wikibook will not require a prior knowledge of integral calculus, and therefore will not go into more depth on this subject then a simple definition, and some light explanation.

=== Definition ===

The convolution a * b of two functions a and b is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty a(\tau)b(t - \tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|Remember: &lt;br&gt;Asterisks mean '''convolution''', not '''multiplication'''}}

The asterisk operator is used to denote convolution. Many computer systems, and people who frequently write mathematics on a computer will often use an asterisk to denote simple multiplication (the asterisk is the multiplication operator in many programming languages), however an important distinction must be made here: '''The asterisk operator means convolution.'''

=== Properties ===

Convolution is commutative, in the sense that &lt;math&gt;a * b = b * a&lt;/math&gt;. Convolution is also ''distributive'' over addition, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c&lt;/math&gt;, and ''associative'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Systems, and convolution ===

Let us say that we have the following block-diagram system:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|[[Image:System Block.svg|400px|center]]
|
*''x(t)'' = '''system input'''
*''h(t)'' = '''impulse response'''
*''y(t)'' = ''' system output'''
|}

Where x(t) is the input to the circuit, h(t) is the circuit's impulse response, and y(t) is the output. Here, we can find the output by convoluting the impulse response with the input to the circuit. Hence we see that the impulse response of a circuit is not just the ratio of the output over the input. In the frequency domain however, component in the output with frequency &amp;omega; is the product of the input component with the same frequency and the transition function at that frequency. The moral of the story is this: ''the output to a circuit is the input convolved with the impulse response.''</text>

== Basic Terminology ==

There are a few key terms that need to be understood at the beginning of this book, before we can continue. This is only a partial list of all terms that will be used throughout this book, but these key words are important to know before we begin the main narrative of this text. 

;Time domain : The time domain is described by graphs of power, voltage and current that depend upon time. The &quot;Time domain&quot; is simply another way of saying that our circuits change with time, and that the major variable used to describe the system is time. Another name is &quot;Temporal&quot;.

;Frequency domain: The frequency domain are graphs of power, voltage and/or current that depend upon frequency such as [[:w:Bode_plot|Bode plots]]. Variable frequencies in wireless communication can represent changing channels or data on a channel. Another name is the &quot;[[:w:Fourier_transform|Fourier domain]]&quot;. Other domains that an engineer might encounter are the &quot;Laplace domain&quot; (or the &quot;s domain&quot; or &quot;complex frequency domain&quot;), and the &quot;Z domain&quot;. When combined with the time, it is called a &quot;Spectral&quot; or &quot;[[w:Spectrogram|Waterfall]].&quot;

;Circuit Response : Circuits generally have inputs and outputs. In fact, it is safe to say that a circuit isn't useful if it doesn't have one or the other (usually both). Circuit response is the relationship between the circuit's input to the circuit's output. The circuit response may be a measure of either current or voltage.

;Non-homogeneous : Circuits are described by equations that capture the the component characteristics and how they are wired together. These equations are non-homogeneous in nature. Solving these equations requires splitting the single problem into two problems: Steady State Solution (particular solution) and Transient Solution (homogeneous solution). 

;Steady State Solution : The final value, when all circuit elements have a constant or periodic behaviour, is also known as the steady-state value of the circuit. The circuit response at steady state (when voltages and currents have stopped changing due to a disturbance) is also known as the &quot;steady state response&quot;. The steady state solution to the particular integral is called the [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Non_Homogenous_1|'''particular solution''']]. 

;Transient Response : A transient response occurs when: 
::a circuit is turned on or off
::a sensor responds to the physical world changes
::static electricity is discharged
::an old car with old spark plugs (before resistors were put in spark plugs) drives by

:Transient means momentary, or a short period of time. Transient means that the energy in a circuit suddenly changes which causes the energy storage elements to react. The circuit's energy state is forced to change. When a car goes over a bump, it can fly apart, feel like a rock, or cushion the impact in a designed manner. The goal of most circuit design is to plan for transients, whether intended or not.

:Transient solutions are determined by assuming the driving function(s) is zero which creates a homogeneous equation, which has a [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Homogenous_1|'''homogeneous solution''']] technique.

== Summary ==
When something changes in a circuit, there is a certain transition period before a circuit &quot;settles down&quot;, and reaches its final value. The response that a circuit has before settling into its ''steady-state response'' is known as the ''transient response''. Using [[:w:Euler%27s_formula|'''Euler's formula''']], [[Arithmetic_Course/Types_of_Number/Complex_Number|'''complex numbers''']], [[:w:Phasors|'''phasors''']] and the [[:w:S-plane|'''s-plane''']], a [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Homogenous_1|'''homogeneous solution''']] technique will be developed that captures the transient response by assuming the final state has no energy. In addition, a [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations/Non_Homogenous_1|'''particular solution''']] technique will be developed that finds the final energy state. Added together, they predict the ''circuit response''.

The related [[Ordinary_Differential_Equations|'''Differential equation''']] development of homogeneous and particular solutions will be avoided.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I feel like the current incarnation of this page gets a little bit off topic. I don't think there is any sense confusing the subject when we can simply distill out all the information that isn't immediately important. Why do we need to blur the line between different types of sources, or even differentiate between different sources, when the only thing we need to mention is what each little symbol does on a circuit diagram. I'll leave this the way it is for now, but i think we will probably need to fix this later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 13:53, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Preamble ==

Installing SPM on Windows 32 bit (XP, Vista, 7) should be relatively straightforward. Common pitfalls can be found in the description of the [[SPM/Installation on 64bit Windows#Preamble|64bit Windows installation]].

== SPM12 ==

=== Installation ===

* Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm12.zip].
* Unzip spm12.zip in a folder of your choice, such as C:\Users\''login''\Documents\MATLAB\spm12).
* Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
 &gt;&gt; addpath C:\Users\''login''\Documents\MATLAB\spm12
in MATLAB's workspace.
* Launch SPM by typing
 &gt;&gt; spm

You might have to install the VC++ 2005 and 2008 Redistributable Packages (''vcredist_x86.exe'') from Microsoft:
* http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019667

=== Update ===

If you have just downloaded the spm12.zip archive, it already contains the latest set of updates.
To update SPM when a new version is released:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Unix world: one file after another==
When you think of a computer and everything that goes with it, you usually come up with a mental list of all sorts of different things:

* The computer itself
* The monitor
* The keyboard
* The mouse
* Your hard drive with your files and directories on it
* The network connection leading to the Internet
* The printer
* The DVD player
* et cetera

Here's a surprise for you: Unix doesn't have any of these things. Well, almost. Unix certainly has ''files''. Unix has endless reams of files. And since Unix has files, it also has a concept of &quot;between files&quot; (think of it this way: if your universe consists only of boxes, you automatically know about spaces where there are no boxes as well). But Unix knows nothing else than that. Everything in the whole (Unix) universe is a file.

Everything is a file. Even things that are really weird things to think of as files, are files. Your (data) files are files. Your directories are files. Your hard drive is a file. Your ''keyboard'', ''monitor'' and ''printer'' are files. Yes, really: your keyboard is a read-only file of infinite size. Your monitor and printer are infinitely sized write-only files. Your network connection is a read/write file.

At this point you're probably asking: ''Why?'' Why would the designers of the Unix system have come up with this madness? Why is everything a file? The answer is: because if everything is a file, you can '''treat''' everything like a file. Or, put a different way, you can treat everything in the Unix world the same way. And, as we will see shortly, that means you can also ''combine'' virtually everything using file operations.

Before we move on, here's an extra level of weirdness for you: everything in Unix is a file. Including the ''processes'' that run programs. Effectively this means that running programs are also files. Including the interactive shell session that you've been running to practice scripting in. Yes, really, that text screen with the blinking cursor is also a file. And we can prove it too. You might recall that in the chapter on [[Bourne_Shell_Scripting/Running_Commands#A_useful_tidbit|Running Commands]] we mentioned you can exit the shell using the Ctrl+d key combination. Because that combination produces the Unix character for... that's right, end-of-file!

==Streams: what goes between files==
As we mentioned in the previous section, everything in Unix is a file -- except that which sits ''between'' files. Between files Unix defines a mechanism that allows data to move, bit by bit, from one file to another: the '''stream'''. A stream is literally what it sounds like: a little river of bits pouring from one file into another. Although actually a bridge would probably have been a better name because unlike a stream (which is a constant flow of water) the flow of bits between files need not be constant, or even used at all.

===The standard streams===
Within the Unix world it is a general convention that each file is connected to at least three streams (that's because that turned out to be the most useful number for those files that are processes, or running programs). There can be more and in fact each file can cause itself to be connected to any number of streams (a program can print and open a network connection, for instance). But there are three basic streams available to all files, even though they may not always be useful or used. These streams are called the &quot;standard&quot; streams:

;Standard in (stdin):the standard stream for input into a file.
;Standard out (stdout):the standard stream for output out of a file.
;Standard error (stderr):the standard stream for error output from a file.

As you can probably tell, these streams are very geared towards those files that are actually processes of the system. In fact many programming languages (like C, C++, Java and Pascal) use exactly these conventions for their standard I/O operations. And since the Unix operating system family includes them in the core of the system definition, these streams are also central to the Bourne Shell.

===Getting hold of the standard streams in your scripts===
So now we know that there's a general mechanism for basic input and output in Unix; but how do you get hold of these streams in a script? What do you have to do to hook your script up to the standard out, or read from the standard in? Well, the happy answer is: nothing. Your scripts are automatically connected to the standard in, out and error stream of the process that is running them. When you read input, it automatically comes from the standard in. Your output goes straight to the standard out. And program errors go right to the standard error. In fact you've already used these streams: every example so far that has printed anything has done so to the standard output stream of your script.

And what about the shell in interactive mode? Does that use those standard streams as well? Yes, it does. In interactive mode, the standard in stream is connected to the keyboard file. And the standard output and standard error are connected to the monitor file.

===Okay... But what good is it?===
This discussion on files and streams has been very interesting so far and a nice insight into the depths of Unix. But what good does it do you to know all this? Ah, glad you asked!

The Bourne Shell has some built-in features that allow you to do neat tricks involving files and their streams. You see, files don't just have streams -- you can also cross-connect the streams of two files. At the end of the previous section we said that the standard input of the interactive session is connected to the keyboard file. In fact it is connected to the ''standard output'' stream of the keyboard file. And the standard output and error of the interactive session are connected to the ''standard input'' of the monitor file. So you can connect the streams of the interactive session to the streams of devices.

But wait. Do you remember the remark above that the point of Unix considering everything to be a file was that everything gets treated like a file? This is why that was important: you can connect a stream from ''any'' file to a stream of ''any'' other file. You can connect your interactive shell session to the printer or the network rather than to the monitor (or in addition to the monitor) using streams. You can run a program and have its output go directly to the printer by reconnecting the standard output stream of the program. You can connect the standard output stream of one program directly to the standard input stream of '''another program''' and make chains of programs. And the Bourne Shell makes it really simple to do all that.

Do you suddenly feel like you've stuck your fingers in the electrical socket? That's the feeling of the raw power of the shell flowing through your body....

== Redirecting: using streams in the shell ==

As explained in the previous section, the shell process is connected by standard streams to (by default) the keyboard and the monitor. But very often you will want to change this linking. Connecting a file to a stream is a very common operation, so would expect it to be called something like &quot;connecting&quot; or &quot;linking&quot;. But since the Bourne Shell has default connections and everything you do is always a ''change'' in the default connections, connecting a file to a (different) stream using the shell is actually called '''redirecting'''.

There are several operators built in to the Bourne Shell that relate to redirecting. The most basic and general one is the pipe operator, which we will examine in some detail further on. The others are related to redirecting to file.

===Redirecting to file===
As we explained (or rather: hinted at) in the previous section, one of the enormously powerful features of the Bourne Shell on top of a Unix operating system is the ability to chain programs together. Execute a program, have it produce output, then automatically send that output to another program as input. The possible combinations are endless, as is the power of what you can achieve.

One of the most common places where you might want to send a program's output is to a file in the file system. And this time by file we mean a regular, classic data file and not a Unix &quot;everything is a file including your hardware&quot; file. In order to achieve this you can imagine that we can use the chaining mechanism described above: let a program generate output through the standard output stream, then connect that stream  (i.e. ''redirect the output'') to the standard input stream of a program that creates a data file in the file system. And this would absolutely work. However, redirecting to a data file is such a common operation that you don't need a separate end-of-chain program for it. Redirecting to file is built straight into the Bourne Shell, through the following operators:

;''process'' &gt; ''data file'':redirect the output of ''process'' to the data file; create the file if necessary, overwrite its existing contents otherwise.
;''process'' &gt;&gt; ''data file'':redirect the output of ''process'' to the data file; create the file if necessary, append to its existing contents otherwise.
;''process'' &lt; ''data file'':read the contents of the data file and redirect that contents to ''process'' as input.


====Redirecting output====
Let's take a closer look at these operators through some examples. Take the simple Bourne shell script below called 'hello.sh':

{{code:Basic
|A simple shell script that generates some output
|&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
#!/bin/sh
echo Hello
&lt;/source&gt;}}

This code may be run in any of the ways described in the chapter [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Running Commands|Running Commands]]. When we run the script, it simply outputs the string &quot;Hello&quot; to the screen and then returns us to our prompt. But let's say we want to redirect the output to a file instead. We can use the redirect operators to do that easily:

{{code:Basic
|Redirecting the output to a data file
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ hello.sh &gt; myfile.txt
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

This time, we don't see the string 'Hello' on the screen. Where's it gone? Well, exactly where we wanted it to: into the (new) data file called 'myfile.txt'. Let's examine this file  using the 'cat' command:

{{code:Basic|Examining the results of redirecting some output
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cat myfile.txt
Hello
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

Let's run the program again, this time using the '&gt;&gt;' operator instead, and then examine 'myfile.txt' again using the 'cat' command:

{{code:Basic|Redirecting using the append redirect
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ hello.sh &gt;&gt; myfile.txt
$ cat myfile.txt
Hello
Hello
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

You can see that 'myfile.txt' now consists of two lines &amp;mdash; the output has been added to the end of the file (or concatenated); this is due to the use of the '&gt;&gt;' operator. If we run the script again, this time with the single greater-than operator, we get:

{{code:Basic|Redirecting using the overwrite redirect
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ hello.sh &gt; myfile.txt
$ cat myfile.txt
Hello
$&lt;/source&gt;}}

Just one 'Hello' again, because the '&gt;' will always overwrite the contents of an existing file if there is one.

====Redirecting input====
Okay, so it's clear we can redirect output to a data file. But what about reading from a data file? That's also pretty common. The Bourne Shell helps us here as well: the entire process of reading a file and pumping its data into a stream is captured by the '&lt;' operator.

By default 'stdin' is fed from your keyboard; run the 'cat' command without any arguments and it will just sit there, waiting for you to type something:
{{code:Basic|cat ???
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I can type all day here, and I never seem to get my prompt back from&lt;br/&gt;
this stupid machine.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I have even pressed RETURN a few times !!!&lt;br/&gt;
.....etc....etc&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;}}

In fact 'cat' will sit there all day until you type a 'Ctrl+D' (the 'End of File Character' or 'EOF' for short). To redirect our standard input from somewhere else use the '&lt;' (less-than operator):

{{code:Basic|Redirecting into the standard input
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cat &lt; myfile.txt
Hello
$
&lt;/source&gt;}}

So 'cat' will now read from the text file 'myfile.txt'; the 'EOF' character is also generated at the end of file, so 'cat' will exit as before.

Note that we previously used 'cat' in this format:

{{bcode:Example|$ cat myfile.txt}}

Which is functionally identical to 

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; myfile.txt}}

However, these are two fundamentally different mechanisms: one uses an argument to the command, the other is more general and redirects 'stdin' &amp;ndash; which is what we're concerned with here. It's more convenient to use 'cat' with a filename as argument, which is why the inventors of 'cat' put this in. However, not all programs and scripts are going to take arguments so this is just an easy example.

====Combining file redirects====

It's possible to redirect 'stdin' and 'stdout' in one line:

{{code:Basic|Redirecting input to and output from cat at the same time|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat &lt; myfile.txt &gt; mynewfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;}}

The command above will copy the contents of 'myfile.txt' to 'mynewfile.txt' (and will overwrite any previous contents of 'mynewfile.txt'). Once again this is just a convenient example as we normally would have achieved this effect using 'cp myfile.txt mynewfile.txt'.

====Redirecting standard error (and other streams)====
So far we have looked at redirecting the &quot;normal&quot; standard streams associated with files, i.e. the files that you use if everything goes correctly and as planned. But what about that other stream? The one meant for errors? How do we go about redirecting that? For example, if we wanted to redirect error data into a log file.

As an example, consider the ls command. If you run the command 'ls myfile.txt', it simply lists the filename 'myfile.txt' &amp;ndash; if that file exists. If the file 'myfile.txt' does NOT exist, 'ls' will return an error to the 'stderr' stream, which by default in Bourne Shell is also connected to your monitor.

So, lets run 'ls' a couple of times, first on a file which does exist and then on one that doesn't:

{{code:Output|Listing an existing file
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls myfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|myfile.txt &lt;/br&gt;
$|}}

and then:

{{code:Output|Listing a non-existent file
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls nosuchfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: no such file or directory &lt;/br&gt;
$|}}

And again, this time with 'stdout' redirected only:

{{code:Output|Trying to redirect...
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls nosuchfile.txt &gt; logfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: no such file or directory &lt;/br&gt;
$|}}

We still see the error message; 'logfile.txt' will be created but will be empty. This is because we have now redirected the stdout stream, while the error message was written to the error stream. So how do we tell the shell that we want to redirect the error stream?

In order to understand the answer, we have to cover a little more theory about Unix files and streams. You see, deep down the reason that we can redirect stdin and stdout with simple operators is that redirecting those streams is so common that the shell lets us use a shorthand notation for those streams. But actually, to be completely correct, we should have told the shell in every case ''which'' stream we wanted to redirect. In general you see, the shell cannot know: there could be tons of streams connected to any file. And in order to distinguish one from the other each stream connected to a file has a number associated with it: by convention 0 is the standard in, 1 is the standard out, 2 is standard error and any other streams have numbers counting on from there. To redirect any particular stream you prepend the redirect operator with the stream number (called the ''file descriptor''. So to redirect the error message in our example, we prepend the redirect operator with a 2, for the stderr stream:

{{code:Output|Redirecting the stderr stream
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ ls nosuchfile.txt 2&gt; logfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;|$|}}

No output to the screen, but if we examine 'logfile.txt':

{{code:Output|Checking the logfile
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat logfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;
|ls: no such file or directory &lt;/br&gt;$|}}

As we mentioned before, the operator without a number is a shorthand notation. In other words, this:

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; inputfile.txt &gt; outputfile.txt}}

is actually short for

{{bcode:Example|$ cat 0&lt; inputfile.txt 1&gt; outputfile.txt}}

We can also redirect both 'stdout' and 'stderr' independently like this:

{{bcode:Example|$ ls nosuchfile.txt &gt; stdio.txt 2&gt;logfile.txt &lt;/br&gt;
$}}

'stdio.txt' will be blank , 'logfile.txt' will contain the error as before.

If we want to redirect stdout and stderr to the same file, we can use the file descriptor as well:

{{bcode:Example|$ ls nosuchfile.txt &gt; alloutput.txt 2&gt;&amp;1}}

Here '2&gt;&amp;1' means something like 'redirect stderr to the same file stdout has been redirected to'. Be careful with the ordering! If you do it this way:

{{bcode:Example|$ ls nosuchfile.txt 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; alloutput.txt}}

you will redirect stderr to the file that stdout points to, then send stdout somewhere else &amp;mdash; and both streams will end up being redirected to different locations.

====Special files====
We said earlier that the redirect operators discussed so far all redirect to data files. While this is technically true, Unix magic still means that there's more to it than just that. You see, the Unix file system tends to contain a number of special files called &quot;devices&quot;, by convention collected in the /dev directory. These device files include the files that represent your hard drive, DVD player, USB stick and so on. They also include some special files, like /dev/null (also known as the bit bucket; anything you write to this file is discarded). You can redirect to device files as well as to regular data files. Be careful here; you really don't want to redirect raw text data to the boot sector of your hard drive (and you can!). But if you know what you're doing, you can use the device files by redirecting to them (this is how DVDs are burned in Linux, for instance).
 
As an example of how you might actually use a device file, in the 'Solaris' flavour of Unix the loudspeaker and its microphone can be accessed by the file '/dev/audio'. So:

{{bcode:Example|&amp;#x23; cat /tmp/audio.au &gt; /dev/audio}}
Will play a sound, whereas:

{{bcode:Example|&amp;#x23; cat &lt; /dev/audio &gt; /tmp/mysound.au}}

Will record a sound.(you will need to CTRL-C this to finish...)

This is fun:

{{bcode:Example|&amp;#x23; cat &lt; /dev/audio &gt; /dev/audio}}

Now wave the microphone around whilst shouting - Jimi Hendrix style feedback. Great stuff.
You will probably need to be logged in as 'root' to try this by the way.

====Some redirect warnings====
The astute reader will have noticed one or two things in the discussion above. First of all, a file can have more than just the standard streams associated with it. Is it legal to redirect those? Is it even ''possible''? The answer is, technically, yes. You can redirect stream 4 or 5 of a file (if they exist). Don't try it though. If there's more than a few streams in any direction, you won't know which stream you're redirecting. Plus, if a program needs more than the standard streams it's a good bet that program also needs its extra streams going to a specific location.

Second, you might have noticed that file descriptor 0 is, by convention, the standard input stream. Does that mean you can redirect a program's standard input '''away''' from the program? Could you do the following?

{{bcode:Example|$ cat 0&gt; somewhere_else}}

The answer is, yes you can. And yes, things will break if you do.

=== Pipes, Tees and Named Pipes ===
So, after all this talk about redirecting to file, we finally get to it: general redirecting by cross-connecting streams. The most general form of redirecting and the most powerful one to boot. It's called a pipe and is performed using the pipe operator '|'. Pipes allow you to join two processes together through a &quot;pipeline&quot;, which directly connects the stdout of one file to the stdin of another.

As an example let's consider the 'grep' command which returns a matching string, given a keyword and some text to search. And let's also use the ps command, which lists running processes on the machine. If you give the command 

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -eaf}}

it will generally list pagefuls of running processes on your machine, which you would have to sift through manually to find what you want. Let's say you are looking for a process which you know contains the word 'oracle'; use the output of 'ps' to pipe into grep, which will only return the matching lines:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -eaf {{!}} grep oracle}}

Now you will only get back the lines you need. What happens if there's still loads of these ? No problem, pipe the output to the command 'more' (or 'pg'), which will pause your screen if it fills up:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle {{!}} more}}

What about if you want to kill all those processes? You need the 'kill' program, plus the process number for each process (the second column returned by the ps command). Easy:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle {{!}} awk '{print $2}' {{!}} xargs kill -9}}

In this command, 'ps' lists the processes and 'grep' narrows the results down to oracle. The 'awk' tool pulls out the second column of each line. And 'xargs' feeds each line, one at a time, to 'kill' as a command line argument.

Pipes can be used to link as many programs as you wish within reasonable limits (and we don't know what these limits are!)

Don't forget you can still use the redirectors in combination:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle &gt; /tmp/myprocesses.txt}}

There is another useful mechanism that can be used with pipes: the 'tee'. To understand tee, imagine a pipe shaped like a 'T' - one input, two outputs:

{{bcode:Example|$ ps -ef {{!}} grep oracle {{!}} tee /tmp/myprocesses.txt}}

The 'tee' will copy whatever is given to its stdin and redirect this to the argument given (a file); it will also then send a further copy to its stdout - which means you can effectively intercept
the pipe, take a copy at this stage, and carry on piping up other commands; useful maybe for outputting to a logfile, and copying to the screen.

A note on piped commands: piped processes run in parallel on the Unix environment. Sometimes one process will be blocked, waiting for input from another process. But each process in a pipeline is, in principle, running simultaneously with all the others.

====Named pipes====
There is a variation on the in-line pipe which we have been discussing called the 'named pipe'. A named pipe is actually a file with its own 'stdin' and 'stdout' - which you attach processes to. This is useful for allowing programs to talk to each other, especially when you don't know exactly when one program will try and talk to the other (waiting for a backup to finish etc.) and when you don't want to write a complicated network-based listener or do a clumsy polling loop.

To create a 'named pipe', you use the 'mkfifo' command (fifo=first in, first out; so data is read out in the same order as it is written into).

{{bcode:Example|$ mkfifo mypipe &lt;br/&gt;$}}

This creates a named pipe called 'mypipe'; next we can start using it.

This test is best run with two terminals logged in:

1. From 'terminal a'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; mypipe}}

The 'cat' will sit there waiting for an input.

2. From 'terminal b'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat myfile.txt &gt; mypipe &lt;br/&gt; $}}

This should finish immediately. Flick back to 'terminal a'; this will now have read from the pipe and received an 'EOF', and you will see the data on the screen; the command will have finished, and you are back at the command prompt.

Now try the other way round:

1. From terminal 'b'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat myfile.txt &gt; mypipe}}

This will now sit there, as there isn't another process on the other end to 'drain' the pipe - it's blocked.

2. From terminal 'a'

{{bcode:Example|$ cat &lt; mypipe}}

As before, both processes will now finish, the output showing on terminal 'a'.

==Here documents==
So far we have looked at redirecting from and to data files and cross-connecting data streams. All of these shell mechanisms are based on having a &quot;physical&quot; source for data &amp;mdash; a process or a data file. Sometimes though, you want to feed some data into a target without having a source for it. In these cases you can use an &quot;on the fly&quot; document called a ''here document''. A here document means that you open a virtual text document (in memory), type into it as usual, close it and then treat it like any normal file.

Creating a here document is done using a variation on the input redirect operator: the '&lt;&lt;' operator. Like the input redirect operator, the here document operator takes an argument. For the input redirect operator this operand is the name of the file to be streamed in. For the here document operator it is the string that will terminate the here document. So using the here document operator looks like this:

{{bcode:Example|''target'' '''&lt;&lt;''' ''terminator string''&lt;br/&gt;
''here document contents''&lt;br/&gt;
''terminator string''&lt;br/&gt;}}

For example: 

{{code:Output|Using a here document|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat &lt;&lt; %%
&gt; This is a test.
&gt; This test uses a here document.
&gt; Hello world.
&gt; This here document will end upon the occurrence of the string &quot;%%&quot; on a separate line.
&gt; So this document is still open now.
&gt; But now it will end....
&gt; %%&lt;/source&gt;
|This is a test.&lt;br/&gt;This test uses a here document.&lt;br/&gt;Hello world.&lt;br/&gt;This here document will end upon the occurrence of the string &quot;%%&quot; on a separate line.&lt;br/&gt;So this document is still open now.&lt;br/&gt;But now it will end....|}}

When using here documents in combination with variable or command substitution, it is important to realize that substitutions are carried out ''before'' the here document is passed on. So for example:

{{code:Output|Using a here document with substitutions|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ COMMAND=cat
$ PARAM='Hello World!!'
$ $COMMAND &lt;&lt;%
&gt; `echo $PARAM`
&gt; %&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World!!|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Capitalize''' means to use uppercase for the first letter of a word.

==Basic Principles==

* '''Proper nouns''': Capitalize nouns that are the unique identification for a particular person, place or thing. 
*: Example: Michael, Minnesota, North America.
* '''Proper names''': Capitalize common nouns like party only when they are part of the full name for the person, place or thing. 
*: Example: I am a member of the Democratic Party. 
*: Example: Are you going to the party? 
They are also lowercased when being used in a plural setting: 
*: Example: The Democratic and Republican parties.
* '''Sentences''': Capitalize the first word of every sentence including quoted statements and direct questions. 
* '''Composition''': Capitalize the main words in the names of books, movies, plays, poems, operas, songs, radio and television programs, etc. 
*: Example: Family Guy.
* '''Titles''': Capitalize formal titles only when used in front of a name, not when used after the name. 
*: Example: Associate Professor John Doe / John Doe, associate professor.
* '''Academic titles''':  Capitalize and spell out formal titles only when they precede a name. 
*: Example:  Chancellor David Nachriener.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This handbook is intended as a reference for everything necessary for a person or group to become self-sustaining in every way possible. It will include information and links to other books which are useful in the obtaining of this goal. In each category information will be organized from less complex and sophisticated methods to ones requiring more sophistication. For example, in the section on construction of shelters the first entry explains how to construct a makeshift temporary structure out of sticks and leaves, while later entries discuss more permanent building methods including ones capable of withstanding hurricane force winds. Because this is such a broad topic, and will doubtless cover information which is available in other books, each section will contain a subsection for linking to other applicable books on the subject being addressed. This will prevent unnecessary work and redundancy.

===Housing and shelter===
     
Your primary consideration in housing type for self-reliance will be what type of building materials are available to you.  Once you have established that move on to consideration of how long you will choose to stay in that location.
     
Temporary shelters are easy and fast to construct and even with several weeks in a location are easy to maintain.  Long term shelters need more forethought and care during construction.

All shelters should be built with at least two doors so that you are not trapped inside the shelter.  Depending on your situation even more consideration to getting out of the shelter could be prudent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">	A strong ridge pole and a good location are the first steps to the debris hut. Make sure the area is high and dry to avoid any problems with water drainage during a storm. The area was checked for abundance of material and possible hazards. (i.e. poisonous plants, insects, deadfalls, widow-makers, etc.) Direction is noted for the door. Look closely; you may find my tracks in a thin layer of debris under the ridgepole.

[[Image:Debris1.jpg]]
 
Next, sticks are placed as ribbing along both sides of the ridge pole. This is done after I have laid down and measured the interior. Note the door opening near the sapling facing east or slightly southeast. 

A good alternative to starting this method that is even easier to make is just to lean sticks against a big long log, fallen tree or rock.

[[Image:Debris2.jpg]]

	Still more sticks are placed to hold the debris up. More dry debris is also stuffed in the interior for comfortable bedding that lifts you off the cold ground. This is also a good time to roof off your entryway by placing four forked sticks into the ground at the desired height, and ribbing the top with a network of sticks.

[[Image:Debris3.jpg]]
 
Start piling on debris thick and high. Note the steep walls for shedding water. 	

[[Image:Debris4.jpg]]
 
	The finished product! The walls are about 2 feet thick, good for a 20 degree night. This was probably my 10th debris hut. It took about 2 hours from start to finish. The rather speedy time (for me anyway) was no doubt due to the extraordinary abundance of material in this beautiful transition forest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well it's wash day again and you've got piles and piles of laundry that needs to be taken care of right away! But you have no electricity! Now what? 

First of all, don't despair! Great Grandmother did it, so can you! She had the tools of the trade though, and you can too with a little ingenuity...

The very first thing to do is gather all your equipment. You will need: 3 large tubs, water tight. These can be made of any material. Years ago iron pots were used for this, but I use galvanized tubs or even plastic for rinsing. Laundry Soap. Of course, lye soap was used many years ago, but if you only have regular laundry soap, so much the better! You can even use bar soap like Ivory. There are liquid laundry soaps designed for use with cold water, which reduce the need for washing in hot water.

A washing board. Yep, you really need this little contraption. Unless that is, you want to take your clothes and pound the dirt out of them with a club! Yes, some ladies actually did this to clean their clothes! Wore the fabric out pretty quickly, I'd say. Believe me, you will get very tired of rubbing your clothes on your hands, get a wash board. You might want to get a bottle of bluing for the whites, and some fabric softener. You'll need a supply of wood for a fire and a safe place to build a fire. One of your pans needs to be able to sit over a fire. You will also need a long stick with which to move clothes out of the hot water, and to stir them in the wash water. 

An alternative to the washboard is a domestic rubber sink or toilet plunger (clean of course). In the past a washing &quot;dolly&quot; was a short wooden pole with four or five wooden legs attached. These devices will easily agitate and beat clothes clean without having to rub using your hands; a lot easier for elders or those with hand problems.

Now, you're ready to start!

Build a good hot fire. Wait a little while and let it burn down a bit so that there are plenty of hot coals. Fashion a way that you can set the tub on the fire, keeping the fire underneath the tub. It is really best to have a tub with feet on it, but you can rig up a good set up using an old grill off of a BBQ or something. Even cinder blocks or large rocks can be used. While the fire is heating, you can separate your clothes, by color and by least to most dirty. 

Fill two rinse tubs with cool, clean water, away from the fire. 

Fill the wash tub about 2/3 with water. Let it heat until very hot, even boiling. You may even want to boil very dirty clothes like work pants, jeans or white socks. Add laundry soap. Remove carefully from the fire and to a table or to the ground. This normally takes two people. 

Pretreat any stains as you normally would. Add your clothes to the hot water, starting with the least dirty ones first like shirts and underwear. 

Be careful of burning your hands in the hot water! Rub the clothes on the washboard. Adding soap as needed. Rub then plunge, rub, then plunge.....remember Far and Away? 

Take the hot clothes out of the wash water with your stick, place them in the first rinse. Rinse and wring as best as you can. Place the clothes in the second rinse, adding fabric softener or bluing if desired. Don't wear yourself out wringing, just hang up the clothes, dripping, outside. If it is in winter or rainy weather, you will have to wring them as well as you can. 

Continue through the dirtiest clothes, re-using the wash water as many times as you can get away with it. Just re-heat it until you have to start over with clean water. You can use the second rinse water many, many times. The first rinse water will have to be changed frequently depending on how much soap you use. 

When I get to the point that I need to change my wash water, I try to find something I can use it for instead of throwing it out. Usually I end up washing the porch, patio or outside of the house. You could wash your deck, boat, or dog kennel, I guess. 

The key to clean clothes is plenty of elbow grease and plenty of rinsing!
Happy Washing!

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Loplin. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Loplin~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
 Run &lt;tt&gt;start.bat&lt;/tt&gt; (win32) or &lt;tt&gt;start.sh&lt;/tt&gt; (Unix) to start the Application.

This starts the application in a maximised window. It is possible to start the application in fullscreen mode as would likely be required in a deployment scenario. See below for further details. 

The lower part of the screen lists all of the current valid accounts. By default, these are 
* Administrator
* Manager
* Employee
* Guest

You can log in as any of these users by selecting the relevant icon. You will not be prompted for a password since all of the default accounts are created without a password. 

 Select the Administrator login


Once logged in as administrator, there are three collapsible panels on the left side of the screen. These are

;Principal:
This is where the basic point of sale operations take place. It is possible to record sales, issue refunds, close the cash for the trading period and create reports on the cash transactions. 

;Administration:
Here you can set up the product catalog and tax categories. You can also run miscellaneous reports (I assume these will be repositioned soon) and configure the basic application level objects (users, tables, floors and other resources). 

;System:
Here you can configure the behaviour of the application infrastructure. For example, the location of the persistent store (by default, a HSQL DB in your home directory), the printer properties and whether the application operates in fullscreen or windowed mode.


== Getting Started ==

=== User Management ===

From the administration panel on the left, select &lt;tt&gt;Configuration&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;Users&lt;/tt&gt;. Here you can add, remove and edit the system users. To add a new user, select the third last icon from the top toolbar and fill in the values for Name and Role. You can optionally set the password and provide an image for this user. 

You can delete the existing accounts by selecting them in the listbox and clicking the icon with the red cross. 
 WARNING: There is no confirmation for any deletion!

To save all of your changes, select the last (save) icon from the toolbar.

=== Tax Management === 
From the administration panel, select  &lt;tt&gt;Stock&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;Taxes&lt;/tt&gt;. Here you can set up tax bands that will later be associated with products. This allows taxation calculations to be performed automatically.

=== Category Management ===

Managing the catalog consists of setting up categories and adding products to those categories. Note that
# Categories cannot be nested
# Products can belong to at most one category
To set up a category, go to the &lt;tt&gt;Administration&lt;/tt&gt; panel and select &lt;tt&gt;Stock&lt;/tt&gt;, then select &lt;tt&gt;Categories&lt;/tt&gt;. The form layout is similar to the user management form. Select the &lt;tt&gt;New&lt;/tt&gt; icon and fill in the values for ID and Category. Note that the category ID must be unique. If you reuse an ID you will receive the error message
 Notice: Cannot create a new record.
If you select the &lt;tt&gt;Information&lt;/tt&gt; button from the error dialog, you should see the following message
&lt;pre&gt;
net.adrianromero.data.loader.DataException: 
java.sql.SQLException: Unique constraint violation:  
in statement [insert into CATEGORIES (ID, NAME, IMAGE) values (?, ?, ?)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the databases way of telling you that you have reused an ID value. 


=== Product Management === 

From the administration panel on the left, select &lt;tt&gt;Stock&lt;/tt&gt; then &lt;tt&gt;Products&lt;/tt&gt;. Here you can add, remove and edit products. To add a new product, select the third last icon from the top toolbar and fill in the values for &lt;tt&gt;Reference&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Buy Price&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Sell Price&lt;/tt&gt;. You can optionally specify values for &lt;tt&gt;Category&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Tax&lt;/tt&gt;. As with categories, the value for &lt;tt&gt;Reference&lt;/tt&gt; must be unique. If you select the &lt;tt&gt;Catalog&lt;/tt&gt; checkbox, the product will appear in to system users when they select the appropriate category.

&lt;pre&gt;Note: products cannot be added until a tax rate and a category has been created for them.&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
From the GENERAL tab, click STOCK. 

Stock Cost per Year.
Stock Volume.         The starting count for this Product.

From the STOCK tab, click PROPERTIES

Auxiliar  -           If this product is on consignment, check this field

Scale
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Typical Workflow ==

== Bulk Operations ==

-- !! How does one import a product list?

&lt;pre&gt;
There are various applications out there that provide access to MySQL data  

from  EXCEL.  One example is found at http://www.sobolsoft.com/excelmysql. 

 It is $29.00 for the full featured Excel Add-In, but it provides complete 

IMPORT and EXPORT data flows - all the features of a spreadsheet, and all the 

functionality of a database.

The free-est, cheapest method would be to key the Product data into a file (CSV 

or some other data format), and then use the MySQL loader tools. PostgreSQL has 

loader tools, too.

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Also, the vast majority of useful COBOL applications came thru the Y2K crisis just fine. ==

I don't know where to start with this statement.  I just want to shake my head and scream here!

The reason why COBOL program made it through the Y2K era intact was due to a herculean effort on the part of thousands of software developers around the world who had to re-learn (or learn for the first time) COBOL, and the Y2K problems were fixed.

That the problems didn't show up was due to the fact that these people actually did their job they got paid to do:  Fix Y2K problems.

See [[w:Y2K]] for some more details on this, but it was a very real problem.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:06, 2 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Finding Your Philosophy, Finding Your style:
Finding your style is one of the most important things to consider in wrestling. It will deteremine your stance, the moves you use, the strategy you choose, and the success you have.  Your style should be based on a number of different factors, many of which will be discussed later in this book.  However right now there are a few basic things to consider, and should serve as a guideline to help you come up with a basic strategy.

#What are your strengths?  Are you a great athlete?  Are you really strong?  Are you extremely bright?  A great athlete will be able to do more complicated moves, whereas someone who is really strong might want to focus on a few basic power moves.  Someone who is extremely bright might try to outmaneuver their opponent into an advantageous position.
#What are your weaknesses?  Do you have trouble with balance? Do you have trouble being aggressive? Are you slower than other wrestlers?  This book aims to help you eliminate most of your weaknessess; however, it is impossible to eliminate all of your weaknesses.  In a match, you should do everything possible to avoid dealing with your weaknessess, then in practice, you should work to eliminate these weaknesses.


*High Vs. Low Percentage moves

*The Clock

*When to be Aggressive


Note: Richard Salamone has generously agreed to let us use any of his posts from the MMA.tv forum, in this section I will put relevant post, which will be edited into book form once the whole book has been outlined.

===What moves to use===
FloorFighter,

I am not sure where you are at in your training, but before focusing on &quot;moves&quot;, learn the so-called basic movements of wrestling.  These prepare you for learning &quot;moves.&quot;

With regard to what is most efficient and most sensible to learn, that does depend on body build (e.g., relatively tall or short), speed (e.g., quick or not), how much of your training you are willing to devote (e.g., BJJ and MMA types will have different goals, e.g., to perhaps mostly defend takedowns vs. initiate leg shot and to also develop some pummeling/cliniching proficiency), etc.

Ultimately, for maximum success, you need to be exposed to a wide variety of technique primarily to be familiar enough so that it is not a surprise and you can defend against it.  You don't, however, need to develop zillions of techiques to be proficient and, in fact, as you are learning, it is my opinion, that it is wiser to focus on a few techniques and set-ups for them and work the heck out of them than &quot;be a jack of all trades and a master of none.&quot;  A good double leg, single leg, a few good tie-ups, pummeling/clinch (with attacks such at front headlock), and defense will get you pretty far.

You don't have to be &quot;unique&quot; to be successful, only good, and good at the basics is a good place to start to be good.

Lee Kemp was a three (I think) time world freestyle champ with a good single, good ties, and good defense.  Boring to watch, yes, but he could get that single on anybody at least once during a match and would typically win  by a point or two or three in generally very low scoring matches (in world competition).

Good luck in your training.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''What is Grammar?''' ==

'''Grammar is the study of how words and their component parts combine to form sentences.'''  Grammar is the scientific study of language that includes ''morphology'' (also &quot;accidence&quot; or the forms that words take) and ''syntax'' (the relation of the words to other words).  Grammar also involves the study of the different parts or elements of speech (for example nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), the relations between those elements. A knowledge of grammar provides a vocabulary to discuss how the language works. 


Need some help?

* St. Cloud State University has a great website that is very useful for writers called LEO: http://leo.stcloudstate.edu. 

It is especially great because it is written based on college writing. It is quite in depth and is broken down into many categories so a writer can find what they need.  Access is available for anyone, not limited to students of St. Cloud State University. 


* A writer can use many different reference tools through  St. Cloud State University's website. Among these references includes free access to the Oxford English Dictionary. Go to http://lrts.stcloudstate.edu. 

Click the &quot;Library&quot; link then the &quot;Online References Resources&quot; drop down menu. Here, there will be a list of many useful resources.  Some of these resources are limited to student only use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''History of Cells'''&lt;/big&gt;
[[Image:Cork_Micrographia_Hooke.png|thumb|right|Cells as seen by Robert Hooke.]]
Cells have often been called the building blocks of life, and are indeed found to the basis of everything we generally classify as life (viruses are their own special category).  Cells were discovered by a British scientist named Robert Hooke in 1665.  The name was originally applied to cells found in a cork!  These &quot;cells&quot; looked like little compartments, similar to the living quarters of monks which were called cells.  Much later on, two German scientists discovered the connection between life and cells.  Matthias Schleiden discovered plants are made of cells, while Theodor Schwann realized animals are composed of cells.  We have since learned that bacteria are composed of single cells (unicellular), while more complex forms of life are multicellular.

&lt;big&gt;'''Cell Theory'''&lt;/big&gt;

The ideas of Schleiden and Schwann helped shape modern biology.  From them we have derived a set of rules for living things.  This is known as the &quot;cell theory.&quot;[[Image:Bronchiolar_epithelium_2_-_SEM.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cells in the lung.]]
*An organism is composed of a least one cell. All living things, from unicellular bacteria to complex humans have at least one cell.
*The cell is basic building block of the organism.  It is the lowest organizational structure of all living things.
*All cells come from previous cells.  Cells are made from other cells during a process known as cellular division.

All living things follow these rules (though there are controversial exceptions to these rules).
[[Category:FHSST Biology]]

&lt;big&gt;'''Types of Cells'''&lt;/big&gt;

There are two types of cells that we see in living things.  A prokaryotic cell lacks a nucleus and is not as complicated as a eukaryotic cell.  Prokaryotes, organisms consisting of prokaryotic cells, are usually unicellular. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, normally consist of many cells working together.  Both structures are surrounded by a membrane, but a eukaryote has organelles.  Organelles are sub-units inside the cell with their own membrane, and a specific function (such as producing food for the cell).  The largest organelle in a eukaryote is the nucleus, which acts as a control center for the cell.

==Abstract==
''This paper looks at aspects of Wikipedia’s structure and process, with specific focus on its community (or organisational) learning. Learning is conceptualised as a collective, collaborative process, whereby multiple perspectives are shared and meanings are constructed. Fundamental to this learning are Wikipedia’s policies and the procedure of collaboration in an often conflicting environment. Conflict is viewed as a key component in the process of creating the content of Wikipedia as well as a key factor in people’s participation in the project. A case study of conflict is presented, of which the focus is on how individual users communicate their opinions and feelings to other users and how these communications are read and/or understood by individuals and/or the community, especially in the light of it being mainly a text-only medium. How experiences are shared between and within projects is seen as a crucial factor in its organisational learning – Wikipedia as an organisation has both traditional and radical features, but its learning, as well as so many other aspects of its proclaimed success, is seen to be predicated on its structure, as well as its policies. Recommendations are made to improve its learning as an organisation as well that of individuals, through the idea and praxis of a learning community.''

== Introduction ==

Wikipedia, the multilingual, open-content, collaborative encyclopedia, has gone from strength to strength. In four-and-a-half years it has grown to contain over two million articles in over 200 languages, and counting. The idea of collaborative-building of an encyclopedia was seeded by its predecessor Nupedia, operated by an expert-only peer-review system and where the idea of a wiki (user-editable) system was implemented, which sparked its flourishing into the sprawling organism it is today, the biggest encyclopedia in the world. Despite its astonishing size, my main focus of this study resides in analyzing three aspects of Wikipedia as a learning process, specifically the organisation, structure and modus operandi of Wikipedia. I am not focusing exclusively on Wikipedia, but also its sister projects (see fig. 1) and its parent, the Wikimedia Foundation (a non-profit organisation, currently registered in U.S., France and Germany, with plans underway for others). Data for this research is mainly obtained from (1) the content and discussion pages from English Wikipedia and Meta, discussions related to Wikipedia, and mailing lists.

My overarching reason for writing this paper is to make recommendations to the community for improving its practice, ie the collaborative writing of an encyclopedia. My objective is, by the end of this paper, to have convinced both the ‘non-Wikipedian’ reader that Wikipedia is a model worth serious consideration, and also the Wikipedian that the good start that has been made needs to be reinforced, or even in parts, restructured. In so doing, I want to redress the imbalance noted by Feenberg (2004) in that previous studies of online communities have tended to describe the workings of the community for an external audience without addressing the needs of the communities or their participants themselves. I also, most importantly, hope to frame the discourse of Wikipedia in terms of it ''actually being a learning community'', rather than as a model, or way of looking at it.

While Wikipedia is not constructed or conceived as a learning environment per se, it does have some interesting characteristics of one. In this paper, I will frame the activities of its users in the light of the theory around learning communities, learning organisations and communities of practice. All of these have their own particularities and they all overlap in parts, but all, I think, are present in the continued work and functioning of Wikipedia. I shall therefore look at each area, in an attempt to come to a better understanding of how best to synthesise them.


== Communities of practice ==

Wenger and Snyder (2000) say that communities of practice: 1) set their own agendas (self-organising), 2) are open to all who are willing to participate (self-selective) and 3) learn and grow through time and hence reinforce their strengths and capabilities (self-perpetuating). Unlike many other online communities, Wikipedia exists for a definite purpose and very real work is being done continuously, as I write and as you read, making it more like other work-based communities of practice than an online discussion group, for example. Wikipedia’s goal, its raison d’etre, is very simply to create and distribute an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in a language they can easily understand (WMF:Main Page) or, in the classic phrase, “of the people, for the people”. This overlaps with the second point above which characterises the entirely voluntary membership of Wikipedia, and which goes for all of its languages and their subprojects (eg. finding sources, article translations – themselves ‘semi-communities’), as well as of course its sister projects (ie. Wiktionary etc.), placing Wikipedia in a straddling role between the Tönnies' (1887) classic demarcation of community and civil society. It also goes somewhat for roles within the communities, like adminship or membership of the dispute resolution process, although these are based on community approval and usually involve a vote. The third point, of course, is the difficult one, and the one I will be focusing on here. To what extent does ‘growth’ and ‘learning’ take place within the community at large and in the smaller communities within this/these communities, and how does it work or can it be done? These are my research questions.

Growth (in size at least) is easily quantified (Voss, 2005); learning, however, is not. But what, at least, do contributors to Wikipedia feel they have learned? To this question, I have been told (apart from “reams of trivia”): how to do research, how to write better academically, how to read and write better in another language, how to get on with and work with members of another culture and to be generally critical of the media in its presentation of information (Lawler, 2005). 


== Organisations, leadership and learning ==

“Hierarchical authority,” writes Peter Senge (1996), “(..) tends to evoke compliance, not foster commitment” (p. 2). Citing Argyris (1994), he claims that the problems of traditional organisations are that they stifle potentially damaging information for self-preservation purposes, when in fact this is precisely the kind of information that is needed for their development. He then goes on to advocate the conception of new types of leadership in order to improve the flow of communication

While Wikipedia does have a somewhat hierarchical system, ie. project administrators, mediation and arbitration committees (on the English Wikipedia) and a board of trustees overseeing the Wikimedia foundation, it offsets this with a decentralised structure throughout. Except for occasional foundation decisions, it is possible to take part in any discussion on policy, directly upon arrival to Wikipedia, whether logged in or not. It is also possible to apply for adminship of any project, once proof of sufficiently substantial edits is given, in many cases after only a month or so of contributing. Essentially, Wikipedia is a composite of many structural systems (M:Power structure) to go alongside the view of a completely open, flat system (Aigrain, 2003). But its openness is still its most basic, enduring and all-pervasive quality (Lawler, 2005) and how, in the final analysis, it must be viewed.

Of course, no discussion of the leadership of Wikipedia is complete without reference to its co-founder Jimmy (Jimbo) Wales. Other co-founder Larry Sanger left after Wikipedia’s first year, having contributed greatly to its workings and principles (at that time), and continues to play an ‘outsider’ role (Sanger, 2004); but it is still very much Wales who retains a uniquely central role in Wikipedia/Wikimedia. His title is disputed (by himself, mainly), but Wales does retain special rights in ultimately safeguarding the project in maintaining its goals and values. He remains quite self-deprecating about his role, and tends to make minimal intrusion into community process; as Anthere wrote on the wikipedia-l mailing list: 

:''“I think a project of such a type can only work ''without'' a strong authority. It is important to let people build their own organisation. Jimbo has this very powerful strength, in that he lets most of the organisation be a self-organisation. For those who know a bit about leadership, it is a rather rare occurence.”'' (23/05/05, ed. C.L., my emphasis, from
:http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2005-April/039181.html)

Essentially, leadership is an open invitation in Wikipedia, and dependent upon people taking roles within the organisation as spelled out by Senge (1996, 2003). Philippe Aigrain (2003) states that the success of analogous ‘information communities’ depend on certain people playing certain roles, such as by referring to useful information, moderating (eg. conflict), challenging opinions etc. We are encouraged to &quot;be bold&quot; and to take matters into our own hands. Also, the praxis of this community is such that it pays to help each other and point out interesting pages, discussions, or simply beautiful images, thus taking from Bordieu's notion of cultural capital or, in a current guise, the gift economy. We help each other - I have said so on my user page and I see my role thus far as being a &quot;questioner&quot; in Wikipedia, which explains the approach taken in my research and the reason I am writing this paper (W:User:Cormaggio). 


== Learning communities ==

Pedagogy has been steadily changing over the last fifty years to reflect the growing view of both knowledge and learning as socially constructed (Cuthell, 2002). Consequently, a drive to make learning more socially situated has begun, with more of a focus on student-student interaction than student-teacher, in order to make it easier for students to share experiences, give each other feedback and learn from each other. A learning community is therefore, rather unsurprisingly, a specifically constructed community of learners.

Greene (2005) says that taking part in a learning community “allows learning to be contextual and social, as well as distributed” (p. 7). Contextual means that learning is situated in the context of where it is learned, eg. operating a machine, in a classroom, on a mailing list etc. The communal element is what makes the learning both social and distributed, in that the experience is shared and collaborative; in this respect the notion of a ‘cohort group’ is useful, in the sense of it being mutually supportive and a potential place for personal growth (Tisdell et al., 2004).

I see many (even, perhaps, any) groups in Wikipedia as being such cohort groups. There are mini-projects within the various language projects that focus on specific tasks, whether it be finding references, improving coverage of a field of study or helping to translate articles or messages between languages. All of these are kinds of cohort groups, and all are potentially learning communities. For instance, a project grew for a while between the Balkan (and environs) Wikipedias to work on a way of representing the past decade of conflict there in a neutral manner, acceptable to differing cultural points of view. The project has since petered out, but is just one example of a group of people coming together to work on a common problem. Potentially, this could be said about any content page in Wikipedia, where the principle of neutrality is constantly negotiated, though itself, in the words of Jimmy Wales, “non-negotiable” (W:NPOV).

Another continuously developing project is the software, the underlying architecture of Wikipedia. Like all open-source software, MediaWiki, upon which all Wikimedia projects run, (W:MediaWiki) is itself freely downloadable and editable. Lawrence Lessig (2004) says the openness of the internet, and particularly open source technology, gives people the opportunity to “tinker” and thereby learn through experience about writing, designing and producing media by and for themselves. Tinkering is also central to Eric Raymond’s (2000) view of creativity and freedom in decentralised collective working; even the byline for MediaWiki, “Because ideas want to be free”, reinforces this message.

So, stated above are some notions of what constitute the major components of the theory on the area of community and learning and how Wikimedia projects may relate. But the questions now arise: does learning actually take place, and if so, how and to what extent? A further, more practical question from my perspective in writing this paper is, what are the learning opportunities in Wikipedia?


== Wikipedia: learning opportunities ==

Apart from the dynamics of distributed learning-through-discovery, the main potential for learning, in my opinion, is conflict. Conflict arises for many reasons in many guises, whether through difference of culture, ideology or belief, or simple misunderstanding, prevalent in a text-only medium. It may be about the presentation of content in a partisan manner, or whether a particular piece of information or image etc. should be there at all. It is the main source of heat generated in the project and comprises a huge part of the general discussion that I have seen. These conflicts often spill over into flames or edit wars, sometimes with little or no discussion on potential solutions, but simple deadlock. This is where third parties come in, sometimes voluntarily by themselves, or else by request to comment on, or directly mediate/arbitrate in the dispute.

The words conflict and dispute connote negative images, often justifiably so, though sometimes not. Conflict can be very much constructive or at least productive, depending on the form it takes. Reagle (2004) warns against “facile agreement” in the avoiding of conflict within Wikipedia, and says that it bears the potential for sharing perspectives. A conflict, by nature, comprises multiple perspectives and is thus an opportunity for debate but depends on whether the nature of the conflict is constructive or destructive. In fact, a destructive conflict should be viewed as an extreme form of discussion, even if discussion has broken down. The way to solve a dispute is through discussion; this is fundamental to the general community and, in particular, the Mediation Committee (W:Mediation).

Discussion is the basic state of Wikipedia, between talk pages, mailing lists and IRC channels, and it is as such that the notion of a place of perspective-sharing comes into its own. Returning to the concept of leadership advocated by Senge (1996), the role of leaders is to make sure that communication is happening throughout the organisation; if we transpose this concept to the completely decentralised structure of Wikipedia, we can see that everyone has the potential to take on any one of these leadership roles and consequently to form and frame the work of the community as a whole.

A major aspect of discussion/communication, certainly in a multilingual environment, is that of cultural background. Cross-cultural communication literature is already a big part of business practice, but it is growing within the field of education. Liebkind and McAlister (1999) conducted a study whereby students engaged in story-telling about other countries and cultures and consequently were significantly less xenophobic than students in schools who had not taken part in the activity. It would be interesting to do some research on this in Wikipedia, to see if this finding bore out, but of primary interest (to me at least) is how the discourse of Wikipedia is conducted and how cultural issues are dealt with, and how language is used. As Ferdinand Tönnies (1887) says, “language has not, as we all know, been ‘invented’ or somehow agreed upon as a mere tool for making ourselves understood; it is the very act of understanding at work, both in form and content”. (p. 33) Particularly in the text-based medium of computer-mediated-communication, the language used is crucial to coming to consensus in a conflicting territory.

Finally, being involved in a project such as Wikipedia requires the development of critical thinking, as is often repeated. Wikipedia is a filtering process in the age of information (WMF:Quarto2 letter), and to decide what is eligible and appropriate to enter requires critical faculties. I think that being critical also requires one to be open to criticism of oneself and to avoid defensive reasoning, which according to Argyris (1991) “encourages individuals to keep private the premises, inferences, and conclusions that shape their behavior and to avoid testing them in a truly independent, objective fashion” (p. 103).


== Conflict: a case study ==

One example (among many) this year of conflict and cross-cultural issues was a dispute over the representation of the Cassini-Huygens telescope launched into space as a collaborative venture between US and European scientists. Anthere claimed on the wikiEN-l mailing list that some French scientists had mentioned to her that the represented format of the event on the English Wikipedia was subtly but noticeably biased against the European-built Huygens probe. This point was contested as either being either irrelevant or unfair, and the issue became a dispute, in parts personal and, to an extent, nationalistic. I have presented key points from the participants, taking excellent but not specifically related points out, and for the sake of style and clarity, I have edited some of the comments themselves. Also, since it was discussed in this thread, and having asked the question myself in another, I think there is no benefit from disguising the names of those involved, or more practically, no way of referencing this discussion without identifying its participants (Bruckman, 2002). I also do not wish to cause offence to anyone by bringing this debate out into the open again, but rather think of it as a strong case of perspective sharing, misunderstanding, apology and resolution.


Anthere (15th Jan, 05)
:I am sure it was not done on purpose at all. This is just a view of things so different between one culture and another.

Stan Shebs (15th Jan, 05): 
:I think you're working a bit too hard to find bias here. (..) The &quot;bias&quot; is that we work on what interests us. I've been digging figures of European history out of 1911EB lately, and half the time it's the first information about these in any language WP. We're just perennially short of people to do all the things we would like to get done.
:http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-January/018353.html

Anthere (15th Jan, 05)
:No I am not working too hard. (..) If we want to be perceived reasonably neutral, we just have to pay attention to this type of details. That's all what I would like to say. Consider it crap if you wish.
:http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-January/018355.html

Stan Shebs (15th Jan, 05)
:This is absolutely nothing to do with NPOV, and it's unfair to hardworking editors to say that they're biased and not doing anything about it. What you report fits exactly into the worst stereotypes of the French; sneering at other people's work, but not taking any responsibility for having let this perceived problem go unmentioned for years. You said these scientists “know Wikipedia”; did you ask them why they didn’t do anything about it themselves?
(..)
:There are enough real problems making WP unbiased and neutral; by taking a trivial point of organization never before discussed anywhere, and holding it up as something that matters, you're undercutting all the editors who put in real research and real discussion time on the issues that are genuinely important. Why should I bother spending two hours in the library to research a substantive question, when you're telling the world that WP is biased because some frontpage article doesn't cater enough to nationalistic pride?

:The whole attitude really troubles me. I've put in a lot of WP time over the past two years, and now it feels like it doesn't matter.
:http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-January/018393.html 

Anthere (15th Jan, 05): 
(..)
:We are all biaised, and little can be done about this.

(..)
:But yes, why would I even neglect my whole family and personal job as well as personal health by lack of sleep to try to take care of a project, and try to make it the best possible and the least biased possible, when you are telling me that my opinion has no importance whatsoever, is fantasm and only nationalistic pride ?

(..)
:I can understand that some of you just do not see where the problem is and think I am just nut. That is okay, you can consider I am nut and that there is no bias here. I can accept that. This is exactly where the problems stand when we come to lack of neutrality. One editor considers one point of view and another will not necessarily see the same point of view at all. And this is exactly why we have edit wars, because the second will just not recognise the validity of the first one view and will just refuse that the other one could have a piece of truth in his hands. That is fine. What is not fine is to resort to personal comments on those having a perception that you do not share, and try to lower the possible validity of what they say by resorting of calling her &quot;French&quot;.

:I feel quite upset by your comment. If you wish to close your eyes to internal comments, or to attack those of us who try to point out to what is not perfect, do not be suprised when there is criticism from public audience.

:I apologize to those who participated to the article if they feel I criticized their work. I did not.

:'Point of views' in one's mind are shaped with communal information. Communication is the only way to approach a common reality.

Stan Shebs (16th Jan, 05)
:(Re: Anthere’s original comment)
:It's a very very bad thing to say to people who take issues of bias and npov seriously (..) This is a public mailing list; all the messages are carefully archived forever, then carefully indexed by Google, and if past experience is any guide, there's a good chance that your initial message will be brought out as support for one side or another in an edit war. (..)

:A question as simple as &quot;why doesn't the Huygens probe have its own article?&quot; is usually enough to spur a flurry of edits by knowledgeable people. Those of us who are serious about bias will drop everything else to look at that sort of thing and try to fix it. I think that's part of why your original comment hurts; I've sacrificed a bunch of time working on subjects that I personally don't enjoy, just to try to address other people's claims of bias.

:(Re: ‘French stereotypes’)
:I thought hard about whether to include this, and I fear I was misinterpreted. I personally don't have this feeling; I love France, would go more often if I could, and since November I'm wondering if I could emigrate there. (..)

:I'm sorry to have upset you, that was not my intent.

Zoney 18/01/05:
:(Re: Bias)
:It's a huge problem I think, and one of Wikipedia's biggest to overcome. And denying that it is there is absurd. And I'm not laying the blame solely with US wikipedians, far from it - US bias is just more apparant (to non-US editors) because there are more US editors than not (or than any other single category). I have no doubt there are a minority of articles biased against the US which have perhaps only received non-US editors. And speaking for myself I can for sure point out one or two Irish articles which have been biased by Irish editors for example.

Though this exchange was relatively short (compared to, say, the infamous debates over images and censorship), I think most people involved showed a great measure of maturity and thinking about one another’s perspective, even if it did cause offence. What’s interesting about this exchange for me primarily is that it was rich in emotion and honesty. Of course the content of the dispute, ie. (systemic) bias in the English Wikipedia, is vital to the community, but this issue is a long-standing one and not one likely to have been resolved immediately. 

Like religion, issues of national identity are likely to inflame passions, and this is what happened here (as it has again very recently, in not dissimilar circumstances). Stan’s comments were thoughtful but potentially hurtful, since he himself was hurt, and this made for a heated discussion. Anthere’s comments were full of her characteristic fire, but more importantly, her humanity. Brian tried to diffuse the situation by denying a national bias and tried to inject some humour. And Zoney’s comment was a good indication of the wider picture and a restatement of the difficulty in avoiding bias.

It is exchanges like this that I think are perfect for learning. They include emotional honesty, cultural sensitivity and humility when appropriate. It is an example of the daily discourse within Wikipedia (though, obviously, not all debates will play out like this one), but it is also an indication of the measure by which Wikipedia may be judged, ie. as a culturally sensitive resource and/or community. Potentially, it could serve as a warning to contributors to the issues around cultural identity and bias, though this would need further research. Ultimately though, this discussion shows the dominant discourse of Wikipedia to be centred on neutral and balanced representation and finding the consensus to do so.

== Building Wikipedia ==

The construction of an online community is usefully conceptualised under Jenny Preece’s (2001) notions of sociability and usability, or in other words, how much consideration exists for people’s potential interaction with the community and its technology or modus operandi. “The focus of sociability”, Preece says, “is human-human interaction supported by technology” (p. 349) whereas usability is more concerned with how easy it is to access, navigate and retrieve information from and about the community. I particularly find her suggestions for supporting online social interaction (Preece, 2003) to be inherent insights into understanding the praxis of learning in Wikipedia.

Sociability is achieved in many ways on Wikipedia, mainly through logging in and creating a user page (or, at least, a username) by which you can be recognised and contacted. There are many other modes of communication, eg. mailing lists as stated above, but there are also other ways of getting to know people such as Facebook on English Wikipedia (W:Facebook). This has been shown to be important for the affective needs of participants (eg. Sunal et al., 2003) as well as being a way to introduce oneself and outline topics/fields of interest/expertise, both of which have recently been discussed on the mailing lists. On the mode of discussion, apart from IRC, Wikipedia is an asynchronous format, but, in setting up a watchlist, its functionality allows for quick feedback, another of Sunal et al.’s (2003) criteria for successful online learning community building. Issues of sociability will undoubtedly prove relevant to the development of the upcoming e-learning resource, currently known as Wikiversity.

As outlined above, Wikipedia is being constantly constructed, new versions of its code being released with regularity. This continual flux is just how Vannevar Bush (1945) saw the practice of information storage in his classic essay ''As we may think'' when he says, 

:''“a record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. (..) Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.”''

Wikipedia is not only a continuously evolving resource, but also a continuously evolving entity in site, structure and community. Feenberg (2004) says that new media have to be seen as a process, not as a finished product, lest they become the sole preserve of experts. I am fully aware that this will ring alarm bells in the pro-expertise camp, but this is missing the point: that a developing media should not be fully conceptualised while it is still in process which is very much the case in Wikipedia, as it is the view of many of its users (Lawler, 2005)

== Reflection and meta-cognition ==

Probably the most useful model of learning is that put forward by Kolb and others which views the process as a cycle going from 1) experience, to 2) reflection, to 3) abstract conceptualisation, to 4) active experimentation leading back again to experience (Gibbs, 1988). In plainer terms, this means learning from an experience through a process of reflection and relating past thinking to the experience in order to inform further experiences or practice. Reflective practice is key to understanding our own actions, and thereby learning from them. As Paulo Freire puts it, “Critical reflection on practice is a requirement of the relationship between theory and practice” (Freire, 1998, p. 30) – otherwise, theory becomes meaningless and practice, mindless.

The existence of Meta, and the call for papers for Wikimania itself, is evidence enough of a reflective stance within the larger community (M:Main page; WM:Call for papers). Interestingly, Anthere said that taking part in Meta can take the strain away from contributing to Wikipedia, which can be stressful due to having to write an acceptably neutral opinion; on Meta it is not obligatory (or even advisable) to write from a neutral perspective, but rather to write freely on any aspect of the projects, like where there is a problem, and how it could be improved, or philosophical or sociological aspects of Wikipedia, like for instance the structure of power (M:Power structure; M:Wikipedia:Sociology). This kind of meta-discussion forum is an essential ingredient of what Bieber et al. (2002) call for in their proposals for the evolution of knowledge communities. Wikipedia also answers the call by Ripamonti et al. (2005) for online communities to work out their usage and performance (W:Statistics), and this is open to anyone who has the technical ability (or time and patience to learn) to hack into the MediaWiki software, currently undertaken by Erik Zachte.

Commenting on the internet's influence on our perceptions of time, Ilkka Tuomi (2002) wrote: “On the net we live in dog years, but our memory is that of an elephant” (cited in Holtgrewe, 2004, p. 131). In terms of memory, the transparent structure of Wikipedia does offset this substantially, but the challenge is to maintain the collective memory of the community to continue the process of reflection, and hence, learning. The crucial point here though is that the community continues to be critical of itself and make sense of its various experiences in order to reinforce the quality of its future practice and discourse.

== Conclusions ==

Central, I believe, to the success of Wikipedia is the nature of its participation and the behaviour of its contributors. Much of these issues is covered in policy and guidelines, but much of it comes down to why people get involved and how. The reasons for contributing to Wikipedia are many (Lawler, 2005; W:Wikipedia:Who&amp;Why) and it is clear that many of its most active contributors consider it to be an essential part of their lives, restated around the May 2005 appointment of Foundation officers by Vice-Chair of the board, Florence Nibart-Devouard (Anthere) and the then Chief Research Officer, Erik Möller (Eloquence).

Set against this, however, is possibly the fear of messing up an article, due to lack of language proficiency or knowledge in the area - issues which were raised in the conflict case study mentioned above (though not reproduced here). Chris Allen (2005) also wrote on people's attitudes to participation:

:''“One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the &quot;wiki editing dichotomy&quot;. You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.”''

Militantly meritocratic, Eric Raymond (2003) states bluntly, “attitude is no substitute for competence”. I differ in that I think the key is to temper the meritocracy of Wikipedia (no bad thing in itself) with an appreciation of the cultural value of the individual and the role that each brings with them to the project. It seems to me that Wikipedia, as a project built on the spirit of cooperation, will only succeed in an atmosphere of openness and, crucially, listening. I believe I have shown its good side to a large extent, but any contributor to the Wikimedia community (especially, it seems the English Wikipedia) will be aware of the destructive and sometimes hurtful quality of comments made, or even ignored.


'''Further work on Wikipedia'''

Research in and on Wikipedia is gaining momentum, as people, myself included, flock to it as a fascinating case study in the era of the internet. The incentive for Wikipedia to itself do internal research is ever-growing as the English Wikipedia’s recent drive to initiate article validation, after the success of the German Wikipedia in producing a DVD of its best content. The Wikimedia research network is further evidence of a consolidated effort to gain understanding about the various projects and how best their technical and social needs may be met (M: Wikimedia Research Network). This study has been more of an overall reading of the literature and how it applies to Wikipedia but I also hope to have shed some light on its process, particularly conflict, to improve or at least inform its future practice. Further research needs to be done in many areas, in both quantitative and especially qualitative studies. Qualitative studies are often quite complex and raise important ethical issues, like disclosure of identity, which I have chosen to do here after consultation with the main participants and in the light of Bruckman's (2002) ideas on publishing and publicity. But the crucial point is that we continually inquire into and reflect upon our own practice, in order to better understand it and improve on it for the future.

Findings from the literature on online communities and learning communities are still tentative, but it would be interesting to put a number of them to the test. For instance, Norris (2002) found that online community participation did not have much significant positive effect on contacts across social divides, but that it did across age-gaps – is this the case in Wikipedia? And what about across cultures and, particularly, ideologies? How do projects/communities cross-fertilise each other and do people shy away from some projects and not others? (Stacey, Smith and Barty, 2004) And in terms of Wikipedia really being a learning community and its participants cohort learners, Sujo de Montes, Oran and Willis (2002) ask, “How do we encourage some students to find their voices and speak powerfully and others to find their ears and learn to listen?” (p. 269) These, alongside the many other questions raised on (WM:Call for papers) will serve to enrich and strengthen the process of collaborative working and learning.

Therefore, I make here a number of recommendations that could contribute to the learning of the community overall:

* Learning to become a core competency in the Wikipedia community
* Recognition of the importance of constructive conflict
* Research to explore relationships between projects and possibilities for sharing perspectives and learning
* ‘Lessons learnt’ pages to be created and maintained on Meta

The main work in Wikipedia and all other Wikimedia projects is to continue to work in a collaborative and open sense and, I believe, with the attitude of shared learning. This for me is Wikipedia's strongest asset and the most radical answer to Larry Sanger's and others' criticisms of Wikipedia regarding expertise - that in building a product of excellence, Wikipedia is also building a learning community where leadership is decentralised and expertise is distributed and in so doing creating a new kind of academic community, as already suggested to me by a participant in my previous study (Lawler, 2005). But as it develops its own mode of discourse (Lamerichs &amp; Te Molder, 2003) and its own critical viewpoint, it must make sure that this experience is synthesised into something explicitly useful to the community - we must balance our desire for ongoing distributed learning (or &quot;editor education&quot;, as Tony Sidaway (2005) suggests) with documented information, ie through 'lessons learnt', by which newcomers can themselves learn from Wikipedians' previous experiences. As Lehtinen (2002) puts it:

:''“Knowledge structures based solely on informal and “tacit” knowledge can be very inflexible and provide only limited opportunities for continuous knowledge advancement, typical for dynamic expertise. On the other hand, high-level expert performances cannot be adequately described as individual accomplishments since they are typically based on the use of socially and physically distributed resources. Correspondingly, the view of learning that focuses only on the cultivation of individual minds may be too narrow when developing  teaching–learning environments for supporting the development of expertise.”'' (p. 110)

This emphasises the communal nature of learning, which I believe to be central to both the praxis, progress and even the very notion of Wikipedia. But it also poses us a challenge in making explicit this collective memory whereby the newbies have just as much a chance of benefiting from the community as do the old-timers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Benefits of having citizenship include:
* the ability to vote.
* the ability to run for office.
* can receive a number of government benefits.
* status in the country cannot be revoked.

There are three ways of getting citizenship:
# born in Canada
# born to parents with Canadian citizenship
# naturalization.

Those who successfully obtained permanent resident status will lose that status upon gaining citizenship.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) (17 U.S.C. §§ 117, 512, 1201 et. seq.). Enacted in 1998, and codified as amendments to the Copyright Act, the DMCA addressed a number of computer-related issues: 

Implements two 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties: The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

Notice and Take-Down Provisions (17 U.S.C. § 512): Provides a “safe harbor” to Internet service providers (“ISPs,” a broadly defined term that includes most website operators). ISPs are protected from claims of copyright infringement arising from the posting of copyrighted materials on websites if they reasonably implement and inform users of the ISP’s policy that provides for the identification and termination of infringing material. 

(Note: The ISP must act to remove the infringing works or it may be liable for any resulting damages.)

Anti-hacking provisions (17 U.S.C. § 1201, et. seq.): Prohibits circumvention of technological measures that effectively control access to a copyrighted work as well as prohibits the manufacture, production, trafficking in or offering of any technology, product, service or device that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a copyrighted work.

Maintenance and repair provision (17 U.S.C. § 117): Expands Section 117 of the Copyright Act to authorize an owner of a copy of a computer program to make a copy of the program so long as the copy is made as an essential step in the utilization of the program or for purposes of maintenance or repair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect January 1, 1978. The act protects original works of authorship, including computer software programs, by investing the author with the exclusive right to copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform the copyrighted work, generally for a term of the life of the author plus seventy years.  

The Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act extended the term from life plus 50 to life plus 70 years. The works made for hire term was extended from 75 to 95 years.

Types of work protected:
The Copyright Act protects creative expression in works of authorship (which is defined broadly, with little “creativity” required), but it does not protect facts, ideas, discoveries, processes or methods.

The act also protects databases as creative compilations even though the underlying data may be facts (that are not protected).  

Copyright interests are held by the individual author unless assigned. Copyrights in works created by employees within the scope of their employment are owned by the employer. Copyrights in works created under contract by an independent contractor are retained by the contractor unless an executed assignment or other document provides for a transfer.

Copyright interests attach automatically upon creation of a work of authorship. Copyright registration is optional, but is a prerequisite to commencing an infringement suit. Significant benefits and access to stronger remedies in an infringement suit result from early registration of a copyright.

Downloading music files, graphics or text from the Internet can constitute infringement because an electronic copy of the work is being made. According to some case law, even loading and running a program from disk can be infringement unless authorized by license, since a copy is being made from disk to random access memory.

Note:  There are two legal concepts:
Contributory Infringement  - a person with knowledge of the infringing activity induces causes or materially contributes to the conduct of another to infringe.  

Vicarious Liability - a person or entity has the right and ability to control the activities of the person directly infringing and receives financial benefit from those activities – even if the entity or person is unaware of the activity.

Civil remedies include:
Injunctive relief, actual damages, an accounting of profits and in certain circumstances statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work, as well as impoundment and destruction of equipment and infringement material and paying attorney’s fees.  

Criminal penalties are:
Misdemeanor - up to one year’s imprisonment and fines up to $100,000.
	
Felony - fines up to $250,000 and up to five years’ imprisonment for the first violation and up to 10 years for repeat offenders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Click-wrap/Shrink-wrap/Download Licenses'''

A shrink-wrap license is generally associated with “off the shelf” software in which the license agreement is contained within the software packaging materials. It is in a standard printed form, and is accepted by the customer when the customer carries out a specified task, such as opening the envelope or the shrink-wrapping containing the CD-ROM (breaking the seal while doing so) or by installing the software. 


A variation is to accept the terms of the onscreen license presented during the setup process before the software is installed on the computer. If the license terms are not accepted, the software will not install. This is referred to as '''click-wrap.''' Frequently, the on-screen acceptance is in addition to the software being delivered in a shrink-wrap but as more and more software is preloaded, the click-wrap methodology performs an important function.


Increasingly, software can be downloaded from Internet websites. In such cases, it would be normal for a customer to be presented with an onscreen license agreement, which can either be accepted or rejected. If not accepted, the software will not download. 


The license terms should be presented to the potential customer before the purchasing mechanics take place. This would ensure that they are effective.

A '''web-wrap''' license is considered an Internet contract that asks that user to accept the terms of the license by clicking a “yes” or “no” button before or after seeing the complete agreement. A “yes” gives the user complete access to the website. A “no” prevents the user from gaining access to all or some of the information on the site. This is also known as a '''click-wrap license.'''

__NOTOC__
[[Cookbook:Muffin|Muffins]] are one of many traditional breakfast quickbreads; unlike [[Cookbook:Biscuits|biscuits]], muffins usually contain some form of fruit or other [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]].  These muffins are especially healthy because they are made with [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]].  See the notes at the bottom of the recipe for ideas about how to customize this muffin recipe to your own tastes; the basic proportions should work for any flavor of oat muffin.

==Equipment==
*Large [[cookbook:mixing bowl|mixing bowl]]
*Smaller mixing bowl
*Measuring cups
*Measuring spoons
*Muffin pan(s)

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425&amp;nbsp;°F (220&amp;nbsp;°C)
#Grease muffin pans with cold [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], or pan spray
#In a large bowl, thoroughly combine flour, oats, baking powder and baking soda
#In a smaller bowl, thoroughly combine eggs, sugar, milk, oil, apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, vanilla and raisins
#Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix ''with bare hands'' until just combined.  '''Do not overmix!'''
#Fill muffin cups about three-quarters full, then place on oven's upper rack and turn the oven down to 375&amp;nbsp;°F (190&amp;nbsp;°C)
#Turn muffin pans 180° after 10 minutes; check for doneness after 15 minutes
#Muffins usually take 20 to 25 minutes to cook completely
#Allow to cool briefly (2-5 minutes) before removing from pan

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*'''Optional variations:''' use [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] instead of apple, or dried [[Cookbook:Cranberry|cranberries]] or other dried [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] instead of the raisins.

==Warnings==
*Overmixing will lead to ''worming'', which is caused by [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten development]].  You will see this as vertical tunnels running through your muffins, much like a worm might leave.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If books had been invented after the computer, they would have been considered a big breakthrough. Books have several hundred simultaneous paper-thin, flexible displays. They boot instantly. They run on very low power at a very low cost.  -- Prof. Joseph M. Jacobson, [[W:MIT Media Lab|MIT Media Lab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Creating 'the Last Book' to Hold All the Others |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |newspaper= New York Times |location=New York |date=April 8, 1998 |accessdate=June 03, 2011 |language=English |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/arts/040898book.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Books tend to be bound in factories these days, but the craft of binding books by hand has been practiced without interruption since the second century AD.  There are many good reasons to learn these techniques, from preserving information to creating works of art in bound form.  Whether the content is centuries old or yet to be created, whether the pages were mass-produced or written longhand, and whether the printing was done with a laser printer, movable type, or not at all, books have the same benefits: they turn a collection of loose, vulnerable pages into a compact, accessible package that's well-protected and easy to store.

Okay, so I think that Muffins and Quickbreads (which include muffins, biscuits, scones, crackers, and anything else leavened with baking soda or baking powder) should be categories.  But then I have a very categorical mind.

Photos of the stages and finished product are forthcoming.

A saddle stitch is appropriate for small booklets and, in general, for volumes with only a few pages.  Most magazines that are not glued are saddle stitched: that is, they are held together by staples that run through the [[Bookbinding/Glossary#gutter|gutter]].
Once the pages are aligned and in the right order, this type of binding is quite straightforward.  Staplers with extremely long jaws, designed specifically for saddle stitching, are available in office supply stores.  Some photocopiers produce saddle-stitched volumes automatically.

If neither of these options is readily available, an improvised saddle stitch can be accomplished by using an ordinary stapler in &quot;tacking&quot; mode.  This usually requires swinging the anvil away from the bottom, or detaching the lower jaw of the stapler.  The working surface should be reasonably soft and durable, such as carpeting or a cork board.  Staples can be driven through the centerline of the pages to be bound, and then bent down individually using the cap of a pen.

Saddle stitching can also be done to the individual [[Wikipedia:bookbinding|codex]], using a needle and thread, as part of the process of binding them together into a larger book.

Perfect binding is not a stitch binding at all, but a solely [[Bookbinding/Adhesive|adhesive]] based binding. It is the easiest and least durable way to produce books, and is how most paperback books are bound. 
Single leaves are jogged to form a straight block, and the spine edge is glued with a hotglue- PUR OR EVA - and glued instantly inside a card cover. Hot glue results in a stiff inflexible spine that is prone to cracking over time.

Below is a description of cold-glue fan-binding which is not perfect binding. A proper description of commercial perfect binding needs to be edited in here and a separate page on cold-glue fan-binding (or double-fan binding) written.

Gluing is done with a stiff brush, and is done with a jabbing or light stabbing motion more than a painting one. 

The text block is held in place by a screw press, or just something heavy, like a couple of bricks for a small book. About an inch on the spine side is left hanging over the table in the case of the bricks, and the glue is brushed onto the spine in layers. Press down on the inch over the table to slant that part of the text block and paint glue over the spine again, so that the glue will get into the little spaces between the very edge of the pages. Then, holding the text block, slant the spine pages upward. Without the screw press, these two steps could get all of your pages scattered on the floor if you are not careful. Finally, letting the text block return to its unslanted state, paint glue on again. 

You will need to press the glued pages together at this point and reinforce with a piece of mull that is the same height as the book; otherwise, you will find that the glue will separate the pages sufficiently where you may end up with two or three books instead of one. If you have a screw press, drop the book into the press so that the spine takes pressure and let the glue set in this manner. Protect your book and press with some waxed paper, being careful not to adhere the wax paper to the spine. If you don't have a screw press, take some boards (binder's board, wooden boards) and use these to protect and distribute the weight of the pressure you apply, whether it be in the press or with bricks.

After this dries, the cover is generally glued to the spine to complete the book. Be aware that if you reinforce with mull and intend to glue the book into an existing cover, you will have space issues. If you are making the cover to fit afterwards, there will be no such difficulty.

When '''fishing for pike''' it is useful to know that it is fond of shady places and in summer they frequent the coolest areas in a river; springs, shadows and deep spots)

They generally spawn in March or April and earlier in some Southern streams. In winter they get under rocks, or stumps, or into convenient deep holes, and they can be taken then with small live fish for bait. Often '''Pike''' can be found near the mouth of some small stream emptying into the river; the fall of the year is the best time for catching them.

In the hot summer months they will seldom bite at all, except, perhaps, in a very windy day. In the fall, too, they are in better condition. Pike fishing in the spring is sometimes very successful; however, though the fish are not so good when breeding. In the more northern waters they are sometimes taken as early as August in good condition.

The tackle used for picke is a pretty stiff 10 foot rod, with a reel, and some 50 or 60 yards of flax line which should be protected by the hook with ''gimp'' or wire. The Limerick or Kirby salmon hook is used. The size is 0 to 5, according to the size of the fish. IN a running stream, the sinker and float will also be found necessary. The bait should be a small live fish, or frog, or the hind leg of a frog skinned. In using live bait, when the pike takes it, do not draw your line too quick. The bait, if properly impaled, will be very lively, and will be apt to make a violent effort to escape its enemy. Inexperienced anglers may take this movement for a veritable bite; but when the bite comes, there is no mistaking it. 

In impaling a small fish for bait, pass the hook under the back fin, just under the roots of its rays. This will not disable the fish, and it will appear lively in the water. When using live frog bait, you pass the hook through the skin of the back or belly, or the back muscle of the hind legs. The live frog is generally used on the top of the water - if not, you should let him rise occasionally to take the air. When the pickerel has seized your bait, give him plenty of time to swallow it, and also plenty of line. Sometimes he will hold it in his mouth and play with it before gorging. 

Lures Can also be very effective even in small waters, and can be often quickly worked as Pike espacially in shallows can be very unselective.

== Landing ==
Keep in mind that Northern Pike often are sporadic fighters and not afraid to be drawn to shore.  A fish slowly worked to shore can be surprisingly '''green''' or unsubdued and can put on a tremondous burst of speed and effort when approached.  Many anglers have found out the hard way that you cannot man handle a live pike.

Pike, (as well as other Esox) have lots of teeth, a very boney gill cover and have boney mouths.  They are notoriouly hard to hook and keep hooked and if a green Pike is brough to the hand, when can get serious cut by the thrashing fish or your lures, which might have 6-9 hooks itself.

As one angler has said, once you catch them soon after the excitement ebbs and the fears begins.  Only celebrate your victory against one of Americas biggest predators AFTER you have escaped unscathed.

'''Chicken Riggies''' (recipe by P.A. Johnson) 
This is a Utica, NY classic.  It is well known throughout the greater Mohawk Valley and once a year there is a festival in honor of this dish called Riggiefest, held to benefit the YWCA of the Mohawk Valley.  Here is a recipe based from a Mohawk Valley native:  http://miocibo.com/2008/12/21/chicken-riggies/.  Based on eating the dish hundreds of times at Joey's, listed in Wikipedia as the birthplace!!!!

==Ingredients==
* 1 stick [[cookbook:margarine|margarine]] (not butter), melted
* 1 [[cookbook:onion|onion]], minced
* 2-5 cloves [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]], minced
* 20 oz. jar of sweet peppers (slice and removed seeds)
* 3 sliced hot cherry peppers (jarred ones with oil)
*: Note: it is important to use jarred peppers--the flavor of fresh peppers completely changes the recipe. 
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] 
* 2 lb boneless [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] breast, cubed
* 1 can [[cookbook:Chicken Broth|chicken broth]]
* 1 15 oz can [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]
* ½ pint [[cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 1 small can sliced black olives
* 1 to 1½ lb rigatoni [[cookbook:pasta|pasta]]

==Procedure==
# [[cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] garlic, and peppers in the margarine slowly over low/medium heat until the onions are clear.
# Add the Parmesan, chicken breast, chicken stock, tomato sauce, cream, and olives. [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for about an hour. Serve over 1&amp;mdash;1½ pounds of cooked rigatoni pasta

Sometimes mistakenly considered an American dish, it is commonly found in bakeries throughout Italy and other countries, where it is simply called [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]] and is often bought and consumed on the spot.

'''Tomato Pie''' is generally made with canned tomatoes. In the USA, it is usually served at room temperature, however many bakeries, where it is often bought as fast food, will reheat slices upon request.

Many bakeries and pizzerias have their own variation on the basic recipe.

The basic recipe features thick pizza dough covered with a thick tomato sauce. After cooking the pizza is sprinkled with grated Romano cheese.

==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra-virgin olive oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 large can [[Cookbook:Tomato|crushed tomatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450g) pizza dough
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] grated Pecorino Romano cheese

== Procedure ==
#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|250C]] (450°F). 
#Stretch the pizza dough to cover a greased baking sheet. Dough should be about 3cm (3/4&quot;) thick. 
#Allow the dough to rise while the sauce is prepared.
#Heat a saucepan on medium heat, add the olive oil and garlic. 
#[[Cookbook:Saute|Sauté]] until garlic is just golden. 
#Add crushed tomatoes and oregano.
#Cook until the sauce is thickened, about 15-20 minutes. 
#Cool the sauce until it is room temperature. 
#Top the pizza dough with the sauce, bake in the oven for about 15-20 minutes.
#After removing the tomato-pie from the oven, sprinkle the cheese on top and then let the pizza cool to room temperature.

Serve at room temperature or reheat under the broiler or in a toaster-oven.

This style of tomato pie is very common in the Philadelphia area as well, available at most pizza parlors and Italian bakeries. They're probably common wherever there are concentrations of Italian-Americans.--[[User:BillFlis|BillFlis]] 18:47, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

Cultural determinism is a term used to describe the concept that culture determines economic and political arrangements. It is an idea which has recurred in many cultures over human history, from ancient civilisations through the present. Social construction of technology (also referred to as SCOT) is a form of Cultural Determinism, and a branch of the Science and Technology Studies. Topicly, it includes Social Shaping of Technology, Actor-network theory and Sociotechnical System Theory (developed by Thomas P. Hughes) among others) which is a branch of the sociology of science and technology. It draws on work done in the constructivist school of the sociology of scientific knowledge, as a response to technological determinism. Social constructivists argue that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Social structures are embedded in technologies which shape how users use them.

Leading writers in this field include Wiebe Bijker, Trevor Pinch and Bruno Latour.

== Brief discussion ==
In theories of social development, there are a number which believe that one element is the factor which determines all of the others. One of the most famous is Marx's theory of economic determinism, namely that an individual or class' role in the means of production determines outlook and cultural roles. The idea of cultural determinism is extremely common: numerous societies have believed that their habits, ideas and customs were what determined the shape of their political and economic arrangements, and were the source of their uniqueness above all else. This can be seen in adherence to national epics, particular religious customs, and focus on the importance of language as the determiner of national identity.

Cultural determinism is not limited to one part of the political spectrum or to any one of the Social sciences, but is instead a paradigm used by a variety of writers and thinkers.

== Examples of Cultural determinism ==
There was a prevalent belief among ancient Greeks believed that only those who spoke their language could understand their thought and political arrangements, others were called barbaroi from which the English word barbarian is derived. This identification of culture and politics can be seen in the dual use of the word nomos, which meant both law, and customs or practices. The English words economics and astronomy have nomos as a root word, and reflect this dual meaning.

Niccolò Machiavelli, while he argued that political behavior was universal, also pointed out that elements of culture, particularly religion, could produce particular political arrangements which were advantageous to those that had them.

Sociologist Max Weber wrote about the relationship between Protestantism and Capitalism, arguing that the cultural aspects of religion, including the Protestant work ethic were crucial in the emergence of economic arrangements.

Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel. In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.

In Media theory many writers take the position that political arrangements are determined by the mass media images that people see, and that these, by displacing other forms of culture, determine the economic and political arrangements.

In modern Conservatism, individuals such as commentator Patrick Buchanan and economist Robert Barro argue that cultural norms determine the behavior of political arrangements.

== Criticism ==
In 1993, Langdon Winner pubished an influential critique of SCOT entitled &quot;Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology.&quot; In it, he raises a few problems with social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the effects of the technology after the fact.
# It is a social construction of knowledge in itself, subject to the same limitations as it postulates (&quot;Who says what are relevant social groups and social interests?&quot;)
# It disregards dynamics which are not due to its &quot;preferred conceptual strawman: technological determinism.&quot;

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology. Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has &quot;effects&quot; on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads. However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership. Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies. It would also be possible to claim that a road network changes the way in which goods are distributed around the country and this, in turn, changes a populations' patterns of consumption. The car also made the suburbs possible.

Technological determinism stands in opposition to the theory of the social construction of technology, which holds that both the path of innovation and the consequences of technology for humans are strongly if not entirely shaped by society itself, through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, and the like.

According to Bahá'í teachings, religious history is seen as an evolving educational process for mankind, through God's messengers, which are termed [[:W:en:Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]]. [[/Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]] is seen as the most recent, pivotal, but not final of these individuals. He claimed to be the expected redeemer and teacher prophesied in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and other religions, and that his mission was to establish a firm basis for unity throughout the world, and inaugurate an age of peace and justice, which Bahá'ís expect will inevitably arise.&lt;ref name=&quot;esslemont&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Esslemont, J.E. |year= 1980 |title= Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition= 5th ed. |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id= ISBN 0877431604 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[/Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of [[/Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]]'s teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitab-i-aqdas Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'' constitute the bed-rock of the Bahá'í Faith:
{{cquote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[:W:en:Superstition|superstition]] or [[:W:en:Tradition|tradition]]; the oneness of the entire human race, the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[:W:en:Prejudice|prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between [[:W:en:Religion|religion]] and [[:W:en:Science|science]]; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[:W:en:Bahá'í Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a world tribunal for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[:W:en:Worship|worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and universal peace as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Bahá'u'lláh proclaimed].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0877430209 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-20.html#gr7 | pages=pp. 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <comment>Changed spelling from 'fatHa' to 'fatḥah'; the latter spelling is how it is spelt on the relevant Wikipedia page.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We have learnt about some Arabic letters so far, and have been transliterating using only consonants.  In this lesson, we will learn about the Arabic ''fatḥah'': what it looks like, its purpose, its usage and its sound.

==What it looks like==
The ''fatḥah'' resembles an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent acute accent] such as a French ''accent aigu'' or an Irish ''fada''; sometimes horizontal but usually slanted, it is a line over a letter.  

A ''fatḥah'' is never vertical or beneath a letter.

==Its purpose==
The ''fatḥah'' indicates a short vowel sound, pronounced with the letter on which it is written. 

Example of what is meant by ''pronounced with'': with كَ (''ka''), the ''a'' is pronounced right after the ''k''.  The ''fatḥah'' represents the sound of the ''a''.

==Its Usage==
The ''fatḥah'' is a short vowel [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic diacritic]; its main use is to ensure a reader pronounces unfamiliar words correctly.  

In most books and newspapers the ''fatḥah'' (as with the other Arabic short vowels) is not written; the reader is expected to be able to know the word and its meaning from its context within a sentence.

==Sound==
it makes the short &quot;a&quot; sound.

What is meant by &quot;the short &quot;a&quot; sound&quot;.
It is meant that it is pronounced for a shorter amount of time. Make sure you don't pronounce it &quot;aa&quot;.  And make sure you don't pronounce it so that it rhymes with &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;say&quot;.  Pronounce it so it rhymes with &quot;umbrella&quot;.


If you see a ''fatḥah'' on a letter pronounce the ''fatḥah'' sound right after the letter.
kaaf +fatHa = &quot;ka&quot;


*&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;َك + َ = ك  &lt;/font&gt;

Go over all letters you are familiar with.  Draw each one.  Add a ''fatḥah''.  Instead of pronouncing the letter's name, pronounce it with the ''fatḥah'' (example: instead of &quot;kaaf&quot;, say &quot;ka&quot;).

Perhaps renaming it and adding how to make the dough would help, but it almost looks like a manual for a 'subway' type bakers. I second your decision anyway.

:I've updated this page extensively in order to address these concerns. I left in the bits about shaping the dough and the proofer method of cooking, but made them less of a focus in the article. [[User:Wikidsoup|Wikidsoup]] ([[User talk:Wikidsoup|talk]]) 20:40, 10 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{vegetable}} | [[Cookbook:Legumes|Legumes]]

'''Chickpeas''' are legumes used in the cuisines of [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]],  [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|the Middle East]], and the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]]. They provide high-quality [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] and [[Cookbook:Protein|protein]], are recommended for [[Cookbook:Low-GI Diet|diabetics]], and are credited by some as the key to development of human civilization through agriculture.

There are two main types:

* '''Kabuli''' - '''European chickpeas''', '''ceci''', or '''garbanzo beans''', are large, white chickpeas that are much used throughout southern Europe and the Middle East, but are also used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]] for making dahls. These chickpeas are used as the basic ingredient in [[Cookbook:Hummus|hoummus]] (hoummus means chickpea in Arabic), and are interchangeable with [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|fava beans]] for making [[Cookbook:Falafel|falafel]].  Chickpeas are ground finely to make [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]].
* '''Desi''' - '''Bengal gram''', '''chana''', boont'''([[w:Magahi language|Bihar]]), or '''kadalai''' ([[w:Tamil language|Tamil]]), are much more common in South Asian cuisine. Grinding raw chana to flour makes [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|besan]] or ''gram flour'' whereas ground roasted chana makes Sattu'''. Sattu is the main filler of LITTI''', a famous cuisine of Bihar.

'''Chana dal''' or '''channa dhal''' are split, usually also hulled (skinless) chickpeas used in [[Cookbook:Dal|dals]]. The term nearly always refers to the Desi, but sometimes also to the Kabuli - usually though, Kabuli dal are called ''Kabuli chana dal''. In Tamil, chana dal is called ''kadalai parrappu''. They are often cooked with a pinch of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] to make them more easy to digest.

== Cooking Dried Chickpeas ==

Dried chickpeas are fairly easy to prepare, if you allow enough time.  They taste far better than the canned version.  Dried chickpeas expand to at least twice their volume when cooked. 

# Soak the chickpeas overnight in water.  The next day they are ready to cook. 
# Chop 2 stalks of celery for every cup of chickpeas (a cup is approximately a large handful) and put the drained chickpeas and celery into a pot.  The chickpeas will continue to expand, so you should not fill the pot more than half full of the bean and celery mixture. 
# Add water until the chickpeas are covered. 
# Cook on medium for 2 hours.  The cooking time is not an exact science; you will need to bite into a chickpea to see if it is fully cooked.
# Once the chickpeas are done, drain the cooking liquid.  (Incidentally, the cooking liquid from chickpeas makes a wonderful stock.)
# You can season with salt, pepper, and a dash of olive oil and vinegar if you would like to eat them plain, or they can be used in other recipes calling for canned chickpeas.

=== Cooking Chickpeas with a Pressure Cooker ===

If you have a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]], you can reduce the cooking time substantially.

Well-soaked chickpeas with enough water to cover them will cook to perfection at 15psi in 9 minutes, plus about 10 minutes to depressurise. 

Dried chickpeas can also be cooked directly in a pressure cooker.  Add approximately 3 times as much water as chickpeas, and add a small amount (~10-20ml) of oil to reduce foaming.  Cooking time is 40 to 50 minutes.

[[Image:Ragi Dosa.jpg|frame|Ragi Dosa]]
'''Ragi Dosa''' is one of the traditional foods in Karnataka - [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] (especially South Karnataka).

==Ingredients==
*2 cups ragi (millet)
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dal]] (black lentils)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]], to taste

==Procedure==

#Soak ragi, rice and urad dal separately in water for 5 hours. 
#After 5 hours grind the soaked rice with water first and next with urad dal and ragi (both) with water. 
#Mix up all the ground batter. Leave it for about 10 hours to ferment. 
#After 10 hours put some salt as per your taste to the batter and water if needed. 
#Take a cup of batter and spread it onto a hot [[Cookbook:Tava|thava]].

This Ragi Dosa can be served with onion and garlic chutney.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hanging Gardens ==

While the historical validity of the Hanging Gardens may be questioned, I think taking out a sentence that discusses this concept to be out of line, particularly without some sort of discussion.  Clearly this module needs some work, but the Hanging Gardens are a cultural icon that has survived throughout the ages and is something that a typical person with a little bit of knowledge of ancient history will be familiar with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:12, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

:Any mention of them should include a mention of the question of if they existed.[[User:Geni|Geni]] 01:12, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

== Great job! ==

This is a great module. It seems almost complete, but it has headings with no writing for them. Thanks for contributing this module to Wikibooks and most importantly to Wikijunior. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 02:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== Report after viewing this article ==
=== Coverage ===
The hanging gardens (mentioned above) should be included. My reason, though, is not the same -- it's because it's been listed at one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The existence question and the location question should be included, though briefly; we don't want to puzzle our young readers.

Also needs an introduction, as stated above.
=== Accuracy ===
As far as I know, the things are quite accurate, but I don't know everything in here so I can't be sure that the whole thing is accurate.
=== Grammar and tone ===
Perfect. I like this one.

This module is quite good were it not for the lack of an introduction. I like it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">alif is a very common Arabic letter. When it comes after a letter it causes the long &quot;aa&quot; sound. When it comes at the beginning of a word it means the word starts with a vowel sound.


Basic Appearance
alif looks like a vertical line. It is drawn from the top down. example:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ا&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is called a plain alif, because it carries no symbols.


alif can also carry a hamza. The hamza is drawn after the alif. It looks like this:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;أ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When it makes the &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; sound.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;إ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When it makes the &quot;i&quot; sound (the &quot;i&quot; sound in &quot;bit&quot; not &quot;bite&quot;).



When a plain alif comes after a letter. like so:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ب + ا&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;بـ ـا&lt;/font&gt; Putting it together&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;با&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It makes a long &quot;aa&quot; sound come after it. In the previous example the Arabic letter ب (baa) was followed by a plain alif. So it was read as &quot;baa&quot;, remember a long &quot;aa&quot; sound, not a short one.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: yaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;فا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: faa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;وا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: waa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;دا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: daa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;با&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: baa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;تا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: taa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: kaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ما&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: maa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first letter can also be written with a fatHa and the pronunciation does not change.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يَا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: yaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;فَا&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: faa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But if the alif is not a plain alif, then the long &quot;aa&quot; sound is not made. Something special happens, the purpose of hamza will be covered later.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يَأ&lt;/font&gt; (NOT pronounced: yaa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;فإ&lt;/font&gt; (NOT pronounced: faa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do not forget that the long &quot;aa&quot; sound is only made with a plain alif. If you see an alif with anything on it, it will not make the &quot;aa&quot; sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Dammah. 


==Appearance==
It looks like a loop, or a comma on top of a letter. It always goes on a letter. It is always above a letter never under it. Some examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;  بُ &lt;/font&gt; a baa with a Dammah (pronounced:bu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فُ &lt;/font&gt; a faa with a Dammah (pronounced: fu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُ&lt;/font&gt; a yaa with a Dammah (pronounced: yu)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; رُ&lt;/font&gt;  a raa with a Dammah (pronounced: ru)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


==Sound==
It makes a short &quot;/ʌ/&quot; sound after the letter. This &quot;/ʌ/&quot; sound is the &quot;u&quot; sound in &quot;truck&quot; or &quot;run&quot;. To non-Arabs it sometimes sounds like an &quot;o&quot; sound, this is because the &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; sound are the same sound in Arabic.

More examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; رُنُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: rʌ-nʌ)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـُبُكُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tʌ-bʌ-kʌ)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كُكُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kʌ-kʌ)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُيُ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yʌ-yʌ)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُيُكُتُ&lt;/font&gt;   (pronounced: mʌ-yʌ-kʌ-tʌ)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=Use=
To make a &quot;u&quot; sound right after a letter.

=Waaw=
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;و&lt;/font&gt;
(waaw)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

waaw's main use is to make the &quot;w&quot; sound.
example:
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وِ&lt;/font&gt;  a waaw with a kasra (pronounced: wi) Note that the kasra should be underneath the letter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وَ&lt;/font&gt;  a waaw with a fatHa (pronounced: wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وُ&lt;/font&gt;  a waaw with a Dammah (pronounced: wʌ)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وَتَ&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: wa-ta)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فـَوَ&lt;/font&gt;   (pronounced: fa-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يَوَ&lt;/font&gt;   (pronounced: ya-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==ـُو  (&quot;oo&quot; sound)==
But It is not that simple. There is also another use.

If the letter waaw is plain (no symbols on it) and the letter before it carries a Dammah then the &quot;oo&quot; sound is made, like the one in &quot;food&quot; and &quot;loot&quot;.
Examples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; بُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: boo )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: too)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: foo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُوفـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo-foo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كُوكُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: koo-koo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Remember the waaw has to have nothing on it to make the &quot;oo&quot; sound. Here are some examples where it doesn't make the &quot;oo&quot; sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َبُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bu-wa )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َتـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tu-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ِفـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: fu-wi)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َمُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mu-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َمُوفـُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo-fu-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َكُوكُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: koo-ku-wa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The letter before the waaw must have the Dammah on it, in order to make the &quot;oo&quot; sound. Here are some examples where the &quot;oo&quot; sound is not made.

==ْـَو== 
This sounds like the &quot;aw&quot;, Its the sound many English speakers say when they get hurt. We will write it &quot;au&quot; in transliteration. All the following examples are pronounced so that they rhyme with the sound people make when they are hurt.

Examples:

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;بَو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bau )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَوْ&lt;/font&gt; (pronounced: tau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; فـَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: fau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;مَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مُوفـَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: moo-fau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كُوكَوْ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: koo-kau)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==kasra==

===Appearance===
It is a line that goes on the bottom of a letter. It looks exactly like a fatHa, but it goes under the letter. It always exists with a letter, it cannot be alone.

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; بِ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: be )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كِ &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ki )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; هِيَ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: hi-ya  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تِـتـِتِ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:ti-ti-ti  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Sound===
It makes the &quot;i&quot; sound in bit. It never makes the &quot;i&quot; sound in &quot;I&quot;. It sounds like the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;beet&quot; pronounced very shortly. It is a short vowel.


==kasra and yaa==


&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:ee  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If a plain (with no symbols on it) ي (yaa) comes after a kasra, then the &quot;ee&quot; sound is made. This &quot;ee&quot; sound is exactly the same sound as the &quot;ee&quot; sound in &quot;feet&quot;. It is a long vowel sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; بـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; كِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; هِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: hee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ثِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ''th''ee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;ثِـيتِي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:''th''ee-tee  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The same sound would be made if the &quot;yaa&quot; had something called a sukoon on it (this will be covered later).Examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ْبـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ْكِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

BUT if the yaa has anything else on it then it will not make the &quot;ee&quot; sound.

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; َبـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bi-ya )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ُكِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: ki-yu )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ِبـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: bi-yi )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; ثِـيُرَ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced:thi-yu-ra  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==More difficult examples==

&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يـِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yee  )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُو&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yoo )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;وِي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: wee )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يُوَ&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yu-wa )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; يا&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yaa )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric powder]] 1 tsp

So what if we want to write the &quot;a&quot; sound in &quot;fate&quot;. The fatHa alone will not do that job. In reality the &quot;a&quot; sound in fate, includes a &quot;y&quot; sound in it. So a fatHa followed by a yaa with no vowel on it will make the &quot;a&quot; sound in &quot;fate&quot;. We transliterate this with &quot;ai&quot;. 
Examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;كَي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: kai ) Sounds exactly like the letter &quot;k&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tai )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; وَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: wai ) Sounds exactly like the word &quot;way&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; مَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mai ) Sounds exactly like the word &quot;may&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; سَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: sai ) Sounds exactly like the word &quot;say&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


==More examples==
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;مَيْكَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: mai-kai ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَيْرَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tai-rai )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يَي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yai ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt;يـِي &lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: yee ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+4&quot;&gt; تـَي&lt;/font&gt;  (pronounced: tai )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A popular but less known method of bodybuilding is using solely your body weight to build muscle. This method has advantages in the fact that the exercises are more natural movements, and are less concentrated on individual muscles, which lowers the risk of muscle imbalance and injury. Many athletes use primarily body weight training.

==Exercises==

===Push-ups===
Push-ups are a well known and effective exercises that is easy to learn and very efficient. Primarily  building the pecs and triceps, push-ups also build shoulder-muscle as well as helping to develop a stronger core.

To execute a push-up, lie face-down on the ground with your legs together and your hands pressed flat-palmed against the ground just wider than shoulder-width apart, parallel to your neck. Keeping your body rigid, slowly push up with your arms until they are almost fully extended, with your feet at a ninety-degree angle with your legs, and your toes bend against the ground supporting your legs. Hold for a second at the top, then slowly lower yourself back down, making sure to keep a straight core, until your nose is just above the floor. Repeat reps as able. It is recommended to do three sets of push-ups to maximum repetition every workout. Also, for a more thorough workout change your grip on the ground to thumb and forefinger of each hand touching, just below your chest, and also hands spread wide out on either side. These three grips will allow more thorough muscle development.

If a regular push-up is too challenging, there are variants to make it easier. Firstly, use your knees as a pivot instead of your feet, just rest your knees on the ground instead. If this is still hard to keep good form, use something such as stairs to create an incline so that its easier to complete.

Most bodybuilders do not use push-ups to develop these muscles, as they can do so many; it is more of an endurance workout than a muscle building workout. True muscle building workouts involved sets with a very maximum of 12 reps, and it's usually less than 8 reps. To make the workout more of a challenge, one can use high objects to rest ones feet on, to make the body more of a vertical angle to increase the resistance. Over time, a bodybuilder could work to a vertical position, completing handstands.

===Pull-Ups, Chin-Ups===

Another excellent upper-body workout are pull-ups and chin-ups. Chin ups are when you hold onto a bar, with both palms facing you, then lowering to extension, then lifting until your chin is higher than the bar. These exercises primarily strengthen the latissimus dorsi, but help to tighten arms (biceps) as well. 

To perform, it is recommended that you have a round bar at just over head-height, possibly suspended in a door-way. These pull-up bars are cheap, easy to install, and most definitely a must have. If for some reason you do not have access to a bar, use the top of a door-frame, throwing a folded towel over the top to pad the grip for your hands. Assuming you have a bar, grab the bar with both hands, shoulder-width apart, and your palms facing either away from you or towards you (perform more reps of whichever grip you are weaker at by doing this grip first, but make sure to do both ways for good muscle balance). Then, letting all of your weight hang from your arms, pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar, then lower so that you are still hanging off of the ground. Perform reps until fatigue, and three sets of maximum repetition is also recommended per workout.

Most gyms have pull-up bars, as well as machines that work the latissimus dorsi, and many bodybuilders simply work this muscle group at the gym. When regular chin-ups and pull-ups become too easy, many add weight by simply holding dumbbells between their legs or using weight belts.

===Squats===
A very simple, yet powerful exercise is the squat. Many athletes add weight to this activity when the form they use isn't good and doesn't develop leg muscles properly. Most people would benefit from not using weights initially.

To complete a full squat, place your feet approximately shoulder width apart (a good method is jumping and landing, this is close enough) then lower your body slowly to the ground, while keeping your feet flat, until you're resting on your feet for balance. There are different depths to lower to, but a full range develops all the muscles equally. To increase difficulty, either add weight or attempt a one legged squat, &quot;pistols&quot;.

==Basic Muscle Groups==
The basic muscle groups that body builders normally train can be classified as upper-body muscles and lower-body muscles

===Upper Body===
The important upper body muscles are Shoulders, Chest (Pectorals), Biceps, Triceps, Lattismus Dorsi and Trapezius.

Some of the common exercises used for these muscle groups are

Shoulders - Military press
Chest - Bench press
Latissmus Dorsi - Lat Pull
Biceps - Barbell curl
Triceps - T-Rod 

Military press and Bench press can be done with either barbell or dumbbells

===Lower Body===
The important muscle groups are Gluteals, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Hip Flexors, Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Tibial Anterior

Some common exercise are 
Hamstring, Glutes, Quadriceps, Calves  - Squats (will target different muscle groups depending on stance), Deadlifts.

Squats can be done with either body weight, barbell, dumbbell, kettlebells, Smiths machine and a lever system.

There are many variations of the squat such as front squats, back squats, box squats, cambered bar squats, jump squats, one legged squats (a.k.a. &quot;pistols&quot;) etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why Learn C?==

Isn't Latin more like assembly in that regard?

:Hmm, Latin is more like a hybrid between REBOL/APL with a COBOL-like syntax influenced by FORTH... or just not comparable. [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 18:18, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

==Too much religion!==
Section: '''Why C, and not Java or Basic or Perl?''' answers:
:''Mostly because of memory allocation.''
This is a religious answer, and as such an effort of faith. The '''true''' answer is instead:
:''Learn all of them! If you need full control of memory allocation, then C is one of the better suited languages - along C++ and Objective-C''.
[[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|talk]]) 18:01, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

:And, regarding C++: when parallel programming, the ill defined virtual class tables of C++ poses problems that makes object initialization troublesome in a subprocess. Therefore, C++ is either to be avoided in parallel systems, or a hard discipline of locking parallel processes must be taken. C is in this context more effective, which may explain why few, if any, operating systems are written in C++. (Then probably some Windows versions (but who knows (and who cares about MS anyway?))).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Stephen Wolfram was one of the first to focus on the complete set of CA rules. He observed all the rules that can be created using binary cells &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt; and a three cell neighborhood &lt;math&gt;m=2&lt;/math&gt;. There are &lt;math&gt;k^{k^m}=2^{2^3}=256&lt;/math&gt; such rules. The number of rules grows exponentially with the number of cell states and even faster with the neighbourhood size. This vast number of rules is a limiting factor when observing the whole set of rules.



== Definiton of equivalence ==

In this definition a more formal name for rule is used, the local definition function.

The local definition function &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the local definition function &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;, if and ony if there exists a homomorfism &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of global CA states that 

:&lt;math&gt;f_1  f_2&lt;/math&gt;

== Clustering rules ==

or different symmetries
# input complement
# output complement
# reflection symmetry
# rotation smetry (2D) ?can be produced by reflection no it can not
# equivalence class

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''tanween'' is an &quot;n&quot; sound added to the '''end''' of the word in certain circumstances, usually it functions just like the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; in English, indicating an indefinite article. The word ''tanween,'' literally means marginalize/pushing aside;&lt;ref&gt;See Leviticus chapter 20 &quot;ye shall not marginalize (tanween) the stranger among you; For you were strangers in the land of Egypt&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; But usually translated as &quot;nunation&quot;, &quot;to 'n'&quot;, or &quot;'n'ing&quot;; making an &quot;n&quot; sound.

''Tanween'' is indicated by doubling the short vowel at the end of the word. If a word ends with a &quot;kasra&quot; tashkeel, then the ''tanween'' is indicated by writing two &quot;kasra&quot;s (one above the other); same with the &quot;dhamma&quot;, you write ''two dhammas'', one beside the other. However, with the &quot;fatHa&quot;, you don't only double the &quot;fatHa&quot;, but you also add an &quot;Alif&quot; and put the double &quot;fatHa&quot;s on the &quot;alif&quot;. (remember, &quot;Alif&quot; is the first letter in the Arabic alphabet).
So, we can say there are three types of tanween:
* fatHa ''tanween''.
* kasra ''tanween''.
* dhamma ''tanween''.

==Pronunciation==

'''fatHa tanween: '''
The fatHa ''tanween'' is pronounced &quot;en&quot;, as in &quot;then&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;men&quot;, etc. Even though many native Arabic speakers would use &quot;an&quot; to indicate it, since &quot;a&quot; maps to the &quot;aaaa&quot; sound, &quot;en&quot; is probably more accurate.

'''kasra tanween: '''
The kasra tanween is pronounced &quot;in&quot;, as in &quot;in&quot;, &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;fin&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, etc.
Again, some native Arabic speakers might indicate a kasra ''tanween'' with an &quot;en&quot;, thinking that &quot;e&quot; sounds like the Arabic &quot;yaa&quot; letter (&quot;ii&quot; vowel). This is a mistake that stems from not knowing how native English speakers pronounce the &quot;e&quot; sound.

'''dhamma tanween: '''
The dhamma ''tanween'' is pronounced as a short &quot;oo&quot; followed by an &quot;n&quot;. This sounds like the short &quot;un&quot; in &quot;uno&quot; as pronounced in Spanish, not like the long &quot;oon&quot; in &quot;soon&quot;.

'''tanween at the end of a sentence: '''
If the ''tanween'' is the last thing in the sentence, it's not pronounced. In the case of a fatHa-tanween, the alif is pronounced as a long vowel.

The following pronunciation guide for the case where the tanween falls at the end of a sentence works for all letters in all forms.

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+6&quot;&gt;
 سً
&lt;/font&gt;(sann)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

''Technically, &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;سً &lt;/font&gt; should be written as &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt; ساً&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;سًا&lt;/font&gt;.''
''And &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;بً&lt;/font&gt; should be written as &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;باً&lt;/font&gt; OR &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;بًا&lt;/font&gt;. This is due to stopping (waqf) pronounciation, and spelling rules. Any letter except for &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ء&lt;/font&gt; (hamza) and &lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt;ة&lt;/font&gt; (taa marbooTah), always ends in an alif when it ends in fatHataan (&quot;fatHataan&quot; means &quot;two fatHas&quot;).''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Early Origins Of Hip Hop ==

The roots of hip hop are in West African and African-American music. The griots of West Africa are a group of traveling singers and poets, whose musical style is reminiscent of hip hop. True hip hop arose during the 1970s when block parties became common in New York City, especially the Bronx. Block parties were usually accompanied by music, especially funk and soul music. The early DJs at block parties began isolating the percussion breaks to hit songs, realizing that these were the most dance-able and entertaining parts; this technique was then common in Jamaica (see dub music) and had spread via the substantial Jamaican immigrant community in New York City, especially the godfather of hip hop, DJ Kool Herc. Dub had arose in Jamaica due to the influence of American sailors and radio stations playing R&amp;B. 
DJ Kool Herc
 

Large sound systems were set up to accommodate poor Jamaicans, who couldn't afford to buy records, and dub developed at the sound systems (refers to both the system and the parties that evolved around them). Herc was one of the most popular DJs in early 70s New York, and he quickly switched from using reggae records to funk, rock and, later, disco, since the New York audience did not particularly like reggae. Because the percussive breaks were generally short, Herc and other DJs began extending them using an audio mixer and two records. Mixing and scratching techniques eventually developed along with the breaks. As in dub, performers began speaking while the music played; these were originally called MCs; Herc focused primarily on DJing, and began working with two MCs, Coke La Rock and Clark Kent -- this was the first emcee crew, Kool Herc &amp; the Herculoids.

== Identifying Rap Music ==

The music at which 1 can have its own views without any sorts of the preoccupied thoughts, that creates your true identification of your hip-hop talent, this can be done with only full concenteration of your views related to your life, to your destiny, to your integrity, to your problems, to your love, to your sexual life as well.


===What Is Rap?===
 
Hip hop and Rap are often used as a general name for the whole genre, however whilst they are inextricably linked, it is important to distinguish between the two and acknowledge the differences.  
          
Historically, rap music comes from hip-hop culture. The roots of rap music trace back to the Jamaican ska era of the mid-60s. MCs rapping over party music made its way to New York a decade later, thanks to DJ Kool Herc, a man many crown the &quot;Father of Hip Hop.&quot; Kool Herc migrated from Jamaica to New York in 1967 and helped give birth to the hip-hop culture that would continue to thrive and spread.

The Hip Hop Network notes that while the Sugar Hill Gang's 1979 &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot; was the first breakthrough rap hit, it emerged from a &quot;an inner-city phenomenon centering on DJs and including equal proportions of break dancing, MCing, and graffiti art.&quot; 

More recently, &quot;rap&quot; has been used to describe the aggressive, mass-market produced music of Nas or Eminem. But, as one online encyclopedia points out, &quot;Not all music that has rapping in it, however, is actually rap music, and not all hip-hop music has rapping in it.&quot; Artists like Jurassic 5 and De La Soul typify hip-hop music, which is generally more multi-instrumented and less in-your-face. 

Rap and hip-hop music is now a huge industry, and it has the diversity of a huge industry. Now respected as an established form of music, and many see it as one of the most versatile and original, from Producers/DJs/MCs such as Madlib, crossing Jazz, Blues and other musical styles to influence his work to Dr. Dre producing such commercial names as Eminem and 50 Cent, representing the more 'Rap' commercial style.

'''West Coast Hip Hop'''

West Coast hip hop, also known as California hip hop or West Coast rap, is a style of hip hop music that originated in California in the 1980s. It has since grown into a subgenre of hip hop and has developed several creative centers, most of which are in California.

These centers are: The greater Los Angeles area, Long Beach, the greater San Francisco area (also known as the &quot;Bay&quot; Area ), Oakland/Berkeley, Vallejo, Sacramento/Davis, and Seattle.

'''East Coast hip hop'''

East Coast hip hop (sometimes also referred to as New York hip hop) is a style of hip hop music that originated in New York City during the late-1970s. East Coast hip hop emerged as a definitive subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States, chiefly the West Coast and the South, emerged with different styles of hip hop. It has since grown into a major sub-genre of hip hop, and has played an instrumental role in hip hop history. East Coast hip hop has developed several creative epicenters and local scenes within the Northeastern United States, most of which are primarily located within African-American and Hispanic urban centers.

'''South hip hop'''

Hip hop in the South (sometimes referred to as the dirty South) is a style of hip hop music that has multiple origins in Houston, Miami, Atlanta and Memphis.  Hip hop in the South emerged during the late 1980's and early 1990's.  This regional hip hop has developed into multiple musical sounds like crunk, bounce, snap, chopped &amp; screwed and booty-bass.  Even though initially thought of as unsophisticated and simple, recent success in this region has seen a domination in 2005 of the weekly Top 10 songs in the country and an 2005 '''Academy award''' for Three 6 Mafia [http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1149254697866], a Tennessee-based rap group.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Laam-alif is a ligature. When a ل (laam) comes before an ا (alif) in a word, they automatically come together and form laam-alif. Laam-alif is not a letter, It is how the two letters, laam and then alif are written together.

I removed this line, because there is no difference WYSIWYG editing is available on all platforms as well

Err.. Tex a programming language? Imo it's just a markup language, like html, not programming.

: It's a programming language aimed to typesetting, but you could (theoretically) use it for anything. PostScript is made with the same approach. You can use if-else constructs and there are packages to make dynamic calculations (that are performed while compiling). I'll point this out clearly in the main page.

:: Why '''low-level''' programming language? That sounds like some kind of assembly language.

:::if you are considering a typesetting system, then it's definitely a low-level programming language, because you have to tell the compiler where any object has to be placed, its size, etc. I can't imagine anything lower than this. In any case, it's the &quot;lowest&quot; approach I know for typesetting. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 19:23, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

Hi I noticed that tetex is given as a suggested LaTeX distribution for Unix, but it's currently deprecated, and TeXLive is supposed to be used instead.

== dvipdf and dvipdfm ==

I don't know the difference between ''dvipdf'' and ''dvipdfm'', but when I have used them in the past I always got better output with ''dvipdfm''. I have looked for info on internet, and it looks like it's not just a case, see for example http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/bit/compintro/tips.html , LaTeX section point 8. In the article, at the beginning I just wrote ''dvipdfm'' because I knew it is better, so I didn't want to write about two different tools doing the same thing, when we are sure that one always works better than the other. Is this true? is ''dvipdfm'' a good replacement of ''dvipdf'' in any case? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 22:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

Actually, dvipdfmx is the dvi-to-pdf program that is currently maintained.  it has additional support for cjk, among other things.  dvipdf and dvipdfm are unmaintained and there is no reason to use them.  --karl@tug.org

== Section &quot;Skills needed&quot; ==

I have removed the section &quot;Skills needed&quot;, added to the bulk of the chapter later. It contained such incomprehensible claims as: 
# LaTeX is &quot;very easy&quot; to learn.
# &quot;Familiarity with publishing process is useful.&quot; From what I understand, learning LaTeX has little to do with publishing process.

I am acting on the assumption that the purpose of this book is to make the user use LaTeX effectively, finding quickly how to perform various tasks and solve problems.

== Discrepency of definition ==

I would like to point out a point of confusion I came across as a new user of LaTeX hoping to benefit from this page. During the discussion of installation, first the instructions advise us to download one of the three platform-specific TeX distributions. Later in the discussion, we are told that our &quot;LaTeX distribution&quot; will contain such and such things. But what is a LaTeX distribution? Is it included in the TeX distribution we were advised to download? Where is the discussion on this? This creates confusion, and should be clarified someone who is able to do so. Thanks.

: I've added some details on the different terms. Sadly I fear it will reamin confuse until you actually install and use the whole stuff. The concept is not easy to understand, we cannot do anything about it. If someone feels like he/she can provide a better explanation, feel free to contribute. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 18:30, 31 January 2013 (UTC)

==Re-written first paragraph==

The first paragraph of this page is badly focused, jumping between pronunciation and history, and professional/casual tone. The sentence structure is valid, but the author uses word constructs which are somewhat awkward to English speakers. I have cleaned it up significantly.--[[User:Steelangel|Steelangel]] ([[User talk:Steelangel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Steelangel|contribs]]) 01:34, 1 February 2013 (UTC)</text>

Use the following functions of the word processing program:
== Mail Merge==
Type and print a letter to at least five different people using the same text, but personalizing each letter with the addressee's name appearing at least three times.

The best instructions for doing this can be found in the Help pages of OpenOffice itself.  Knowing that the function is called &quot;mail merge&quot; is the key to finding the right help page.

== Right Justify ==
Using the mouse, highlight the text you wish to right justify.  Then click on the Format tab and select &quot;Paragraph.&quot;  Then click on the &quot;Alignment&quot; tab, check the box labelled &quot;Right,&quot; and click on &quot;OK&quot;.

== Center Title ==
This operation is identical to the &quot;Right Justify&quot; operation, except that instead of checking the &quot;Right&quot; box, check the &quot;Justify&quot; and select &quot;Center&quot; from the pull down menu.

== Change margins and page length ==
Click on &quot;Format&quot; and select &quot;Page.&quot;  Then click on the &quot;Page&quot; tab.  This will bring up a window that will allow you to set the margins (left, right, top, and bottom) as well as the page dimensions.

== Move paragraph ==
Using the mouse, highlight the paragraph.  Then type &lt;ctrl&gt;X to delete the paragraph.  Move the mouse cursor to the paragraph's new location and type &lt;ctrl&gt;V.

== Save ==
Type &lt;ctrl&gt;S or select Save (or Save As) from the File menu.

== Copy and Paste ==
This is almost exactly the same as moving a paragraph, the only difference being that once the paragraph is highlighted you press &lt;ctrl&gt;C instead of &lt;ctrl&gt;X.  This will put the highlighted text in the paste buffer, but it will not delete it from the document.  It can then be pasted into a different place by typing &lt;ctrl&gt;V.

The number ten is not .l, but 1., since numbers are written from left to right, unlike normal words.

Also, drawing guides would be nice. Illustrations that show the direction and order of the strokes.--[[User:66.157.116.9|66.157.116.9]] 21:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

I find this strange (added 1 April 2006 by TwoThirty):
  &quot;Arabic numerals (how the numbers look) are of two
   types, the one's used in North America, and the one's
   not used in North America.&quot;
(&quot;Nort America&quot;:)
This loosely implies South America and Europe would
use non-European &quot;arabic&quot; numbers. On the other hand,
replacing it with &quot;Europe&quot; would imply the same about
North and South America (and most parts of Africa, etc). 
(&quot;two types&quot;:) There seems to be at least three types.
The paragraph is difficult to reformulate. 
Maybe just remove it. The table says it all.

What determines the type of bond formed between two elements? There are two ways of classifying elements to determine the bond formed:  by electronegativity, or by metallic/non-metallic character.  

== Electronegativity ==
Electronegativity is a property of atoms which is reflected in the layout of the periodic table of the elements.  Electronegativity is greatest in the elements in the upper right of the table (e.g., fluorine), and lowest in the lower left (e.g., francium).

{{Wikipedia|Electronegativity}}
''Electronegativity'' is a relative measure of how strongly an atom will attract the electrons in a bond.  Although bonds are the result of atoms sharing their electrons, the electrons can be shared unequally.  The more electronegative atom in a bond will have a slight negative charge, and the less electronegative atom will have a slight positive charge.  Overall, the molecule may have no charge, but the individual atoms will.  This is a result of the electronegativity—by attracting the electrons in a bond, an atom gains a slight negative charge.  Of course, if two elements have equal electronegativity, they will share the electrons equally.
[[Image:Pauling.jpg|thumb|left|Linus Pauling created a commonly-used measure of electronegativity.]]

Metallic elements have low electronegativity, and non-metallic elements have high electronegativity.  If two elements are close to each other on the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|periodic table]], they will have similar electronegativities. 

Electronegativity is measured on a variety of scales, the most common being the ''Pauling scale''.  Created by chemist Linus Pauling, it assigns 4.0 to fluorine (the highest) and 0.7 to francium (the lowest).

==Bonds==
'''Non-polar covalent''' bonds occur when there is equal or near-equal sharing of electrons between the two bonded atoms.  This should make sense because covalent bonds are the sharing of electrons between two atoms.  Molecules such as Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are good examples. Typically, a difference in electronegativity between 0.0 and 0.4 indicates a non-polar covalent bond.

'''Polar covalent''' bonds occur when there is unequal sharing of the electrons between the atoms. Molecules such as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are examples of this. The typical rule is that bonds with an electronegativity difference between 0.5 and 1.7 are considered polar.  The electrons are still being shared between two atoms, but one atom attracts the electrons more than the other.

'''Ionic''' bonding occur when there is complete transfer of the electrons in the bond. This type of bonding does not lead to the formation of molecule, but rather consists of a stacking of a great many ions, such that an overall neutral lattice is formed. Substances such as NaCl and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are examples. Generally, electronegativity differences of 1.8 or greater lead to ionic bonding.  The electronegativity difference is so great that one atom can attract the electrons enough to &quot;take&quot; them from the other atom.

== Notation ==
When drawing diagrams of bonds, we indicate covalent bonds with a line.  We may write the electronegativity using the symbols &lt;math&gt;\delta +&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta -&lt;/math&gt;.  Look at this example.

&lt;center&gt;Hydrogen fluoride (HF): &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\delta + &amp; &amp; \delta - \\ H &amp; - &amp; F \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The plus goes over the less electronegative atom.  From the above diagram, we can see that the fluorine attracts the electrons in the covalent bond more than the hydrogen does.  Fluorine will have a slight negative charge because of this, and hydrogen will have a slight positive charge.  Overall, hydrogen fluoride is neutral.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Many of Celestia's display characteristics and the databases that it uses can be controlled by modifying its configuration file, ''celestia.cfg''.

More extensive changes and additions to Celestia can be provided using Addons and [[Celestia/Celx Scripting|Celx Scripting]].

== Celestia Configuration File==

''The following information is from the comments in the Celestia Configuration File,'' celestia.cfg. 

This file contains configuration data read by Celestia each time it is run. Many of the items may be changed to suit your specific needs or requirements. PLEASE make a backup copy of this file before you make any changes to it.

To learn more about Celestia, visit the Celestia forums at:  http://www.shatters.net/forum/ or the Celestia web site at: http://www.shatters.net/celestia/

=== Data Files ===

This section contains a list of data files that Celestia uses to load  information about stars, constellations and locations. DO NOT change  these file names or the order in which they are listed, unless you  know exactly what you are doing. Most of these files can be viewed  with a plain text editor. Discussion about their content and formats  can be found on the Celestia forums: http://www.shatters.net/forum/   If you want to load all your stars from .stc files, you can now comment  out the StarDatabase entry.

  BoundariesFile               &quot;data/boundaries.dat&quot;

=== User Interface files ===
Despite their &quot;.cel&quot; file extension, these are not CEL scripts, but  rather data files that populate controls such as menus and dialog  boxes.   

*FavoritesFile  -  This is where Bookmarks data are stored. The file does not exist until  you save a Bookmark from within Celestia. You can view this file with  a plain text editor and if you write CEL scripts, it contains some  useful information.   
*DestinationFile  -  This is the list of Destinations used in the Tour Guide dialog box,  accessed via the Navigation Menu. You can edit this file with a plain  text editor to add your own destinations to the dialog box. The order  in which the items are listed in the file is the order in which they  will be listed in the Tour Guide dialog.   

Cursor    This parameter allows you to select from three cursors, but currently  only in the Windows version of Celestia ...   
* White crosshair (&quot;crosshair&quot;) &gt; default cursor   
* Inverting crosshair (&quot;inverting crosshair&quot;)   
* Standard Windows arrow (&quot;arrow&quot;)   

The inverting crosshair can be a better choice because it's more  visible on bright backgrounds. However, should you decide to try this  cursor, TEST IT CLOSELY. Not all graphics chipsets support an inverting  cursor, which will cause Windows to fall back to software emulation.  The emulated cursor interacts with OpenGL applications in unfortunate  ways, forcing a lot of extra redrawing and cutting by half the frame  rate on a GeForce2-equipped laptop. So, if you change this, check your  FPS rates to make sure you haven't kicked Windows into software  emulation mode. 

  FavoritesFile    &quot;favorites.cel&quot;
  DestinationFile  &quot;guide.cel&quot;
  Cursor           &quot;crosshair&quot;

=== Included CEL script files ===   
The following CEL script files are included in the basic Celestia  distribution. These script files may be viewed and edited with a  plain text editor. They may both be modified or replaced to suit your  specific needs.   InitScript is the CEL script that is automatically run each time  Celestia is started. The default script (start.cel) travels to Io, one  of Jupiter's moons.   DemoScript is the CEL script that is run when you press the &quot;d&quot; key  on your keyboard from within Celestia. The default script (demo.cel)  takes you on a short tour of some interesting places in our solar  system.   To learn more about how to use and write CEL scripts and Lua scripts  in Celestia, please visit the Celestia Scripting forum at:    http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=9 

  InitScript  &quot;start.cel&quot;
  DemoScript  &quot;demo.cel&quot;

=== Extras ===
The 'extras' directory is located under the celestia root directory  and is used for storing third-party add-ons to Celestia. To learn  more about Add-Ons for Celestia, visit the Celestia Add-Ons forum at:  http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=6   You may specify additional add-on directories by adding additional  entries, such as the following example shows:  ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;extras&quot; &quot;myextras1&quot; &quot;myextras2&quot; ]   To specify absolute paths on windows, you either have to use &quot;/&quot; or   double backslashes to separate path components. Example:   ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;D:/celestia-extras&quot; ]  or ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;D:\\celestia-extras&quot; ] 

  ExtrasDirectories  [ &quot;extras&quot; ]

=== Font definitions ===
The following entries define the fonts Celestia will use to display text on the display screen. To view the list of fonts available with your distribution of Celestia, look in the fonts directory located  under the Celestia root directory. The default fonts are UTF-8 compatible in order to display non-English characters.   

*Font:      Used to display all informational text. Default: &quot;sans12.txf&quot;   
*LabelFont: Used to display all label text (objects, locations, etc.). Default &quot;sans12.txf&quot;   
*TitleFont: Used to display object names, messages, and script text. Default &quot;sansbold20.txf&quot; 

  Font       &quot;sans12.txf&quot;
  LabelFont  &quot;sans12.txf&quot;
  TitleFont  &quot;sansbold20.txf&quot;

=== Miscellaneous ===

LogoTexture defines the graphic file to be displayed when Celestia is started. The default filename is &quot;logo.png&quot; 

  LogoTexture  &quot;logo.png&quot;

FaintestVisibleMagnitude defines the lowest magnitude at which a star will be displayed in Celestia. This setting may be adjusted real-time via the '[' and ']' keys in Celestia. The default value is 6.0. 

  FaintestVisibleMagnitude 6.0

RotateAcceleration defines the speed at which an object will be  rotated in Celestia, when using a keypress, such as the left and right arrow keys. A higher value will rotate the object quicker, while a lower value will cause a slower rotation. The default value is 120.0. 

  RotateAcceleration 120.0

MouseRotationSensitivity defines the speed at which an object will be rotated in Celestia, when using the mouse press both mouse-buttons or Ctrl+LeftMouseButton, and move the mouse left or right. A higher value will rotate the object quicker, while a lower value will cause a slower rotation. A value of 0.0 (zero) will disable this particular feature. The default value is 1.0. 

  MouseRotationSensitivity 1.0

=== Scripting ===
The following parameter is used in Lua (.celx) scripting.  ScriptScreenshotDirectory defines the directory where screenshots are to be stored. The default value is &quot;&quot;, i.e. Celestia's installation directory. 

  ScriptScreenshotDirectory &quot;&quot;

CELX-scripts can request permission to perform dangerous operations, such as reading, writing and deleting files or executing external programs. If granted, a malicious script could use this to destroy data or compromise system security.  The following parameter determines what Celestia does upon such  requests: &quot;ask&quot;: ask the user if he wants to allow access (default) &quot;allow&quot;: always allow such requests &quot;deny&quot;: always deny such requests.

  ScriptSystemAccessPolicy &quot;ask&quot;

=== Rendering Resources ===
The following lines are render detail settings.  Assigning higher  values will produce better quality images, but may cause some older  systems to run slower.     OrbitPathSamplePoints defines how many sample points to use when    rendering orbit paths. The default value is 100.     RingSystemSections defines the number of sections used to draw rings around a planet.    The default value is 100.     ShadowTextureSize defines the size* of shadow texture to be used.    The default value is 256. Maximum useful value is 2048.     EclipseTextureSize defines the size* of the eclipse texture to be used.    The default value is 128. Maximum useful value is 1024. The ShadowTextureSize and EclipseTextureSize values should both be powers of two (128, 256, 512, etc.). Using larger values will      reduce the jagged edges of eclipse shadows and shadows on planet  rings, but it will decrease the amount of memory available for  planet textures.  The shadow and eclipse texture settings are not used with the OpenGL 2.0 render path, which uses a different technique to render shadows.

  OrbitPathSamplePoints  100
  RingSystemSections     100
 
  ShadowTextureSize      256
  EclipseTextureSize     128

Set the level of multisample antialiasing.  Not all 3D graphics hardware supports antialiasing, though most newer graphics chipsets do.  Larger values will result in smoother edges with a cost in  rendering speed.  4 is a sensible setting for recent, higher-end  graphics hardware; 2 is probably better mid-range graphics.  The default value is 1, which disables antialiasing.

  AntialiasingSamples        4

The following line is commented out by default.  Celestia enables and disables certain rendering features based on the set of extensions supported by the installed OpenGL driver and 3D graphics hardware.  With IgnoreGLExtensions, you may specify a list of extensions that Celestia will treat as unsupported.  This is useful primarily for the developers of Celestia.

   IgnoreGLExtensions [ &quot;GL_ARB_vertex_program&quot; ]

=== LogSize ===

The number of rows in Celestia's internal debug log. This log is displayable onscreen by pressing the ~ (tilde) key (tilde space on some keyboards). The default log size is 200 lines.

 LogSize 5000

=== Labelled Stars ===
The LabelledStars section defines which stars will have text labels  assigned to them, which are visible when this option is turned on. (This section is '''obsolete''' as of Celestia v1.5.0. Star names are displayed depending on the brightness of the stars.)

  LabelledStars

Those who practice journalism are known as journalists.Journalism is often dangerous but very practical in day today world.

News-oriented journalism often is described as the &quot;first draft of history.&quot; Even though journalists often write news articles to a deadline, news media usually edit and proofread the results prior to publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In modern medical science, the use of statistical methods are ubiquitous, insofar as the research builds on quantitative methods. Whether the research question originates in the laboratory, the clinic, or epidemiologic registries, appropriate statistical methods are called for to collect, analyze and interpret the data. The ambition of the present book is to provide an introduction to basic statistical tools, so that it may be used as a companion in a first academic course on statistics for medical students.

The presentation should be as easy to follow as possible while maintaining a sufficient level of rigour. The book will not give insight into all the mathematical background needed to derive the stated results in a formal way, but rather focus on helping the understanding of the student. The exposition will be based on worked examples, with the focus on pedagogical analyses. Ideally, all examples should be taken from relevant and published medical studies, but this needs careful consideration of any copyrights involved. As a simple alternative, suitably simulated data can often be introduced instead.

==Contents==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Analysis of a single sample ==

Before getting started with the theory, we will consider a simple example. The example will expose the basic components of a statistical analysis and aim to give an intuitive understanding of the type of results that can be obtained from such an analysis.

A naive question on the human body temperature is whether or not, it on average is 37&amp;deg;C? To answer this question a study was done, which measured the temperature on 130 individuals. The data can be downloaded here [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/datasets/normtemp.dat normtemp.dat] and documentation can be found in ([http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v4n2/datasets.shoemaker.html Shoemaker, 1996]), and references therein. A brief summary of the data is the following, so-called ''stem-and-leaf'' plot:


  Stem-and-leaf plot for tempC (Body Temperature / Celsius)
  tempC rounded to nearest multiple of .1
  plot in units of .1

  35s | 7
  35. | 899
  36* | 011
  36t | 222222333333
  36f | 444444555
  36s | 66666666666677777777777777
  36. | 888888888888888999999999999
  37* | 0000000000111111111111111111
  37t | 2222222333333
  37f | 44445
  37s | 7
  37. | 8
  38* | 
  38t | 2

This shows, for example, that one person (first from the top) had a body temperature of 35.7&amp;deg;C, another (second from top) had 35.8&amp;deg;C, while two (three and four from the top) had 35.9&amp;deg;C, and so on. Most had temperatures around 36.6&amp;deg;C to 37.3&amp;deg;C.

A very similar graphical presentation of the same data is given in the histogram below:

[[Image:TempC_hist.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Histogram of 130 persons body temperatures.]]

If we want to summarize the data using numbers, two important measures are the ''mean'' and the ''standard deviation'' (SD). For this sample of data, the mean is 36.805&amp;deg;C and the SD is 0.407&amp;deg;C. We will later give a more precise definition of these two ''summary statistics'' but for now we can think of them as giving the central point of the data (the mean) and a measure of the variability of the data around their mean. Graphically, the mean can be thought of as the balancing point of the distribution were the columns of the histogram to have weight identical to their area. The SD can for this kind of data be interpreted as follows: If we take the mean and subtract two times the SD, respectively add two times the SD, then approximately 95% of all the subjects will have body temperatures in this interval.

After this first look at the data, let us return to the question of interest: Is the true average body temperature 37&amp;deg;C? One way of answering this is to turn the question around, and start with assuming that 37&amp;deg;C is actually the true, average temperature. The question then becomes, what would samples of size 130 from such a hypothetical population look like? This can be answered with statistical theory, or &amp;ndash; in this computerized age &amp;ndash; with simulated samples based on random number generation. Specifically, let us assume that this hypothetical population has the distribution of body temperatures shown below:

[[Image:TempC_hypoth.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Distribution of body temperature in a hypothetical population with mean 37&amp;deg;C and an SD of 0.407&amp;deg;C.]]

Imagine that we next draw 1,000 samples, each consisting of 130 individuals. What would their means look like? This is shown here:

[[Image:TempC_samplemean.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Histogram of mean body temperature in 1,000 samples from a hypothetical population with a true mean of 37&amp;deg;C and an SD of 0.407&amp;deg;C.]]

Again we see an approximately bell-shaped histogram. The averages of the samples are centered around 37&amp;deg;C (like the hypothetical distribution was), but with a much smaller spread than before. All of the one thousand averages lie between 36.89&amp;deg;C and 37.10&amp;deg;C. This is the first important observation we can make: The variability of an average is smaller (usually much smaller) than the variability of a single observation. We shall later see, that an explicit formula exists describing this reduction in variability. The second important observation, is that none of the one thousand samples had a mean equal to 36.805&amp;deg;C or less (remember that 36.805&amp;deg;C was the actual mean observed on the &quot;real&quot; individuals). It is thus extremely unlikely to get a sample mean of 36.805&amp;deg;C, had the true average temperature in the population been 37&amp;deg;C. This is what is known as a statistical significant result, which is tecnical jargon for stating that the actually observed data is very different from what would be expected, had the investigated hypothesis (is the true average of body temperatures 37&amp;deg;C?) been true. The answer to our question is thus that while we cannot completely rule that the true average body temperature is 37&amp;deg;, it would be extremely unlikely to observe what we actually did observe, had the true average been 37&amp;deg;. Hence, we conclude that the true average body temperature is not 37&amp;deg;, ie. we reject this hypothesis.

So it was not 37&amp;deg; which is actually not a very informative finding. The far more interesting question is, what the true average body temperature could then be, judged from what we observed in this sample. This is typically answered with a so-called ''confidence interval''. The fundamental rationale behind a confidence interval is to use the data to obtain the best possible (ie. narrow) interval where the true value of a parameter can be expected to be found with a given probability, typically 95%. Formulas for computing the interval depend on type of data and the way they were sampled, but we will defer this to later Chapters and for now concentrate on their interpretation. 

Hence let us again consider the hypothetic population described above with mean 37&amp;deg;C and an SD of 0.407&amp;deg;C.
In the Figure below we see the result of computing 95% confidence intervals for 50 random samples from this hypothetical distribution. Each interval is represented by a dot indicating the mean of the specific sample while the vertical lines indicate the confidence interval computed for the sample.

[[Image:TempC_sampleci.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Fifty 95% confidence intervals based on 50 samples from a hyphypothetical normal distribution with a mean of 37°C and SD of 0.407°C.]]

Note that of the 50 confidence intervals, there are only two which do not contain the true value of 37&amp;deg;C, the true value for this hypothetical population. This matches rather closely with the definition, stating that 95% of such intervals should contain the true value. In other words 5% of the intervals should not contain the true value, which for 50 samples would correspond to 2.5 of the intervals not covering the true value.

For our specific sample based on real observations the 95% confidence interval is (36.73&amp;deg;C; 36.88&amp;deg;C). The main conclusion regarding the average human body temperature based on this dataset, is thus that the best estimate of the true mean is 36.81&amp;deg;C and we are 95% confident that the true value is somewhere in the range of (36.73&amp;deg;C; 36.88&amp;deg;C). It is the latter part of the statement, which is crucial to appreciating the value of a statistical analysis: If conducted properly it yields a measure of the uncertainty of the results, or in everyday words we have measured the likely distance to the true value, ''eventhough'' we don't know its exact value.

This page is very big.  Maybe i should split it up into several pages?  Comment here over the next few days if there is a problem with that.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 09:36, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

== Bandplan? ==

I clicked on the link to this page expecting to see the Amateur Radio Bandplan. The content of this page is irrelevant to amateur radio! [[User:Dodger67|Dodger67]] 10:34, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

== Stuff on the page ==

Is all the stuff about radio stations in Germany relevant to amateur radio? Also, the parts about longwave, mediumwave and shortwave transmiters seems out of whack as there really arn't any amateur bands in the frequencys covered in that table. I'd expect to see something mentioning WWv/WWVH or CHU, or another time becon....

== More about stuff on page ==

Seeing as it doen't make sence for this to be here, and wikibooks has a history to it. I will be removing the content in one step, and adding things such as frequencys for WWV, WWVH, and CHU Canada. I know there are more, but those are what I'll add for now.

On VFD, the general concensus (so far) is that this book be kept. I think however that it needs some work. I dont know where (if anywhere) that this book is shelved. I think that this book needs to expand it's list of topics to cover. I would be happy to start fleshing this book out in the coming weeks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

I just wanted to say... This is a great page!!! I already know the kana, but it helped me remember the proportions of every letter and the correct way to write them. The Mnemonics are great!! Havent seen alot of good Japanese guide pages like this on the net =)

[[User:Obake|Obake]] 15:56, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

== Very good lesson - please provide more! ==

I'm a beginner at Japanese and I'd like to learn the entire Hiragana. At first I thought it was going to be an impossible task because of my bad memory for shapes, but this lesson made it really simple. Please create lessons for the rest of the Hiragana too!! [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 19:21, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Never mind, I just saw that on &quot;Kana Lessons&quot; there are more. However, this first lessson should link to the rest, and so should the overview page where I only saw lesson 1!

== English-equivalent &quot;Sounds-Like&quot;'s ==

The then-current version did not actually say HOW to pronounce the vowels, so I added some allegories. Could use more polish. - [[Special:Contributions/116.71.38.86|116.71.38.86]] ([[User talk:116.71.38.86|talk]])

== Suggestion == 

Throughout this section, the links to the next lesson contain the Japanese text, along with arrows (such as ''On to Lesson 2 - かきくけこ&gt;&gt;''). I would like to suggest removing the arrows (or at least separating them with a space from the other text) so that beginners don't mistake them for Japanese characters. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 01:17, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

== Pronunciation guides, without country-specific bias? ==

The first example says it's pronounced like 'a as in alright', but based on which country's English though? The 'a' in 'alright' sounds like 'ah' for North Americans and 'aww' for Brits and Australians. I suppose the example given is the American version, but as not all the readers of this will be American could there be more general examples given please.</text>

{{wikipedia|Unix-like}}
{{wikipedia|Unix}}
The [[w:operating system|operating system]] installed on many [[w:server|servers]] and some [[w:computer workstation|workstations]] is '''Unix-like'''. But what does it mean to be [[wikt:like#Preposition|like]] Unix? In this book, a Unix-like system is one that is similar to [[../BSD|*BSD]], [[../Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[w:Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]], and [[w:Research Unix|the original Unix]]. Today, [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X]] also qualifies as a Unix-like system.

==General Concepts==
As opposed to the (point and click) (graphical user interfaces) familiar to the general computer user, work usually gets done in unix in a text-based way, through what's known as the (command line shell).

As opposed to a (single-user) operating system which permits computer usage only by one person at one particular time, unix is a
multi-user system, that allows access of multiple users to the computer simultaneously. Normally this is achieved by having the
users access the system (remotely), through digital networks.

Whether accessing (remotely) or not, users need a (user account) before being granted access to the system; for the purposes of
accounting, security, logging and resource management.

Since each particular user account has varying degrees of control over the system and its resources, having the ability to verify
the true identity of a given user is crucial, so a method exists that verifies each user account (username) against a corresponding
(password); in a process known as (logging in).

All Unix-like systems are similar. As with many operating systems for servers, the Unix-like systems can host multiple users and programs simultaneously. Some features are specific to Unix-like systems. The Unix-like systems provide a common [[w:command line interface|command line interface]] called the ''shell''. They also provide a common programming interface for the [[Programming:C|C language]]. The latter fact allows most Unix-like systems to run the same [[:Category:Computer software|application software]] and [[:Category:Desktop environments|desktop environments]].

Unix is popular with programmers for a variety of reasons. A primary reason for its popularity is the building-block approach, where a suite of simple tools can be streamed together to produce very sophisticated results. Another reason is the philosophy that 'everything is a file', which means that a standardized set of operations and functionality can be performed on different file types (directories vs. regular files), hardware devices, and even system processes.

==The shell==
{{wikipedia|Unix shell}}
The ''shell'' is a program unique to Unix-like systems. It lets you type commands to launch other programs.

When you login to the system through a text-only terminal, Unix gives you a login shell. If your system has a [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]] such as [[Using GNOME|GNOME]], [[Using KDE|KDE]], or anything that uses [[Guide to X11|X Window System]], you can access the shell through a program called a console emulator or terminal emulator. This emulates the text-only terminal that the shell requires for running.

Unfortunately, the shell and the commands are hard to learn. Further, many commands require &quot;arguments&quot; to work. For example, the '''rm''' command, which removes files, needs one or more &quot;arguments&quot; naming the files to delete. This book has a [[../Explanations/Shell Prompt/]] chapter which introduces the shell and its many features.

One can automate tasks by saving shell commands in a text file called a [[w:shell script|shell script]]. For example, shell scripts are used to boot the system.

The Unix shell is unique to Unix-like systems. Actually, there are multiple shells available for Unix. These shells extend their features in different ways. For the &quot;Bourne-compatible&quot; shells, there is a book in Wikibooks,[[Bourne Shell Scripting]], to describe them. Most shell scripts are for Bourne-compatible shells.

==The C language==
Unix is the origin of the popular [[Programming:C|C language]]. Every program on the computer links to the ''C library'' which provides basic system features including access to the kernel. Even if an application is written in another language, like C++, it still links to the C library. An interpreted language like perl needs a perl interpreter linked to the C library.

This dependence on C can be a disadvantage. Most Unix-like kernels are written entirely in C; most common programs use C, [[Programming:C plus plus|C++]] or [[Programming:Objective-C|Objective-C]]. It is difficult to add code to these programs in another language such as Fortran. In contrast, some non-Unix systems allow different programming languages to interact more easily.

This book does not describe how to program with C; that is the job of the book [[Programming:C]]. However, planned additions to this book will describe how to build and run Unix programs when you obtain their C source code.

==The kernel and userland==

{{wikipedia|kernel (computer science)}}
{{wikipedia|userland}}
Each Unix-like system has a ''kernel''. This program controls the computer [[wikt:hardware|hardware]].

All other programs on the system are part of ''userland'', which means outside the kernel. The kernel shares the system between all running userland programs. To use the keyboard, the network connection, or another part of the hardware, a userland program must contact the kernel using [[w:system call|system calls]]. The kernel allows multiple programs to share the hardware safely. It also switches programs in and out of the [[w:Central processing unit|processors]]; thus it is a &quot;[[w:Computer multitasking|multitasking]]&quot; kernel.

For example, a web server like [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], through the kernel, can simultaneously make multiple network connections to multiple web browsers. The same computer might also be running other server programs. As another example, a user on desktop system (with [[Using GNOME|GNOME]], [[Using KDE|KDE]], or [[w:Xfce|Xfce]] for example) can simultaneously open multiple windows containing file managers, word processors, and games. While the file manager copies files and the word processor prints a document, the user can play a Tetris clone at the same time.

Today, a very popular kernel is [[../Linux/]]. [[w:Linux kernel|Linux]] qualifies as [[w:Free_software free|free]] and [[w:open source|open source]]; even if Linux is running a server for millions of users, there is no licensing fee. Linux is usually combined with [[w:GNU|GNU]] to form the UNIX-like operating system, GNU/Linux (although there are some instances where it isn't combined with GNU). Thus, an easy way for a home user to obtain a Unix-like system is to install a GNU/Linux distribution that includes a friendly desktop.

When we want to configure the network connection, storage systems, or other parts of the hardware, we must often use special utility programs that configure the running kernel. Some of those programs are described in this book.

==Neutral point of view==
The intention is that this book has [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]]. Thus, this book claims not that Unix is always the best choice for any task. It will mention both advantages and disadvantages of Unix-like systems.

{{TOCleft}}
An '''environment variable''' is a setting normally inherited or declared when a shell is started. You can use shells to set variables; the syntax varies but Bourne shells use:

 '''$ ''VARNAME''=''&quot;new value&quot;'''''
 '''$ export ''VARNAME'''''
 ''or''
 '''$ export ''VARNAME''=''&quot;new value&quot;'''''

Each program started from that shell will have ''VARNAME'' set to ''new value''. The names of environment variables are case-sensitive; by convention they are uppercase.

A '''shell variable''' is like an environment variable, except that it is not exported to new programs started from that shell. (You could export it, but normally you just write a shell initialisation script to set it in each shell.)

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
==EDITOR==
The editor program called by sudoedit, vipw, and other such programs when you tell them to edit a file.

''Examples:''
 EDITOR=vi

 EDITOR=emacs

Also see '''VISUAL'''.

==HOME==
The home directory of the user. Most programs use this shell variable to find your home, thus you can set this variable to override the setting in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt; for your home directory. This way, you can start programs that put dotfiles or other files in a different directory than your usual home directory.

In most shells, &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; refers to your home directory. In C shell, and some more recent versions of Bourne shell, &lt;tt&gt;~tux&lt;/tt&gt; always refers to the home directory of user tux as specified in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;, while &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; (without a username after it) always refers to the value of HOME, even if it differs from your home directory in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;.

==LOGNAME==
The name of the user. This is an easy way for a user to get own username. However, programs must not trust this variable because it can be set to an arbitrary value.

Both LOGNAME and USER should be set to the username.

''Examples:''
 LOGNAME=tux

 LOGNAME=sudhir

==MAIL==
The location of incoming local email. When '''mail''' or another local email reader inherits this environment variable, it uses this variable to find the inbox.

Some users do not have email at their local Unix box, but instead use the Internet to access their mail server, in which case the MAIL environment variable is irrelevant.

Many users do not have MAIL set, in which case the email reader uses the default setting. The default value for user &quot;tux&quot; would be &lt;tt&gt;/var/mail/tux&lt;/tt&gt;, which is where many systems deliver mail.

==MAILCHECK==
:''This is a shell variable, not normally exported as an environment variable.''

The frequency for which &quot;bash&quot; checks and alerts you for new local email.

==MANPATH==
The path used by the man(1) command to search for manual pages.  The MANPATH environment variable is formatted with ':' separators just like the PATH environment variable.

==PAGER==
The pager called by man and other such programs when you tell them to view a file.

''Examples:''
 PAGER=less

 PAGER=more

==PATH==
A space or colon separated list of directories in which the shell searches for executables when a command is run without an absolute path. For example '''ls''' doesn't have an absolute path, but '''/bin/ls''' does).

Some systems set PATH using the system shell initialization files, such as &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt; for Bourne shells. Some systems set PATH before this as part of the login procedure, for example in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/login.conf&lt;/tt&gt; for OpenBSD systems. For example, a Linux box could set the PATH at login, then add &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin&lt;tt&gt; to the path using &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt;, then add &lt;tt&gt;/home/ambler/bin&lt;/tt&gt; to the path using &lt;tt&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/tt&gt;.

The system boot scripts also set PATH. On some Linux boxes, the first command to set the path would seem to be in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit, which is one of the shell scripts invoked by the init process (inittab).

''Examples:''
 PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/home/puffy/bin

If this PATH is set and you type the shell command
 $ '''uname -r'''

then the shell searches for the &quot;uname&quot; executable program. First it searches in /bin, then /sbin, then /usr/bin. If /bin/uname is an executable (which it should be), then the shell stops searching and runs it. If /home/puffy/bin/uname also is executable, it is not run, because the search never reached that directory.

In most cases, you only append to the PATH shell variable before exporting it to the PATH environment variable.  To delete a directory from your search path, you must reassign the entire PATH variable to a new, shorter string, and often this takes a great deal of typing or some cut and paste operations.

==PS1==
:''This is a shell variable, not normally exported as an environment variable.''

The '''bash''' and public domain '''ksh''' shells use this as the prompt string.

Things that can be put in the prompt string include &lt;tt&gt;\h&lt;/tt&gt; (hostname), &lt;tt&gt;\u&lt;/tt&gt; (username), &lt;tt&gt;\w&lt;/tt&gt; (absolute pathname of working directory), &lt;tt&gt;\W&lt;/tt&gt; (name of working directory w/o path), &lt;tt&gt;\d&lt;/tt&gt; (date), &lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; (time).

On some Red Hat boxes, the primary prompt string is set in the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file. The prompt is also set in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/tt&gt;, but the setting in bashrc seems to take precedence. A &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; file runs /etc/bashrc, which sets the prompt. Because every instance of &quot;bash&quot; runs &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt;, the prompt also appears in X sessions started from a display manager such as &quot;xdm&quot;.

On some Slackware boxes, the command line prompt is set in /etc/profile. The xterm and rxvt prompts are different. The prompt is not set for X sessions, but it would be if you write a &lt;tt&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/tt&gt; to do that. Prompts are shell variables set from shell initialisation scripts. They are not xterm settings set by X resources such as &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm&lt;/tt&gt;.

* ''A Practical Guide to Linux'', by Mark G. Sobell and published by Addison-Wesley (1998), has more information on prompt strings at page 331.

==PS2==
:''This is a Primary shell variable, not normally exported as an environment variable.''

The '''bash''' and public domain '''ksh''' shells use this as a secondary prompt string.

==USER==
This variable should have the same setting and purpose as [[#LOGNAME|LOGNAME]].

==VISUAL==
This variable is used to specify the &quot;visual&quot; - ''screen-oriented'' - editor.  Generally you will want to set it to the same value as the EDITOR variable.  Originally EDITOR would have be set to '''ed''' (a line-based editor) and VISUAL would've been set to '''vi''' (a screen-based editor).  These days, you're unlikely to ever find yourself using a  teletype as your terminal, so there is no need to choose different editors for the two.  Nevertheless, it is useful to have both set:  Many programs, including less and crontab, will invoke VISUAL to edit a file, falling back to EDITOR if VISUAL is not set - but others invoke EDITOR directly.

''Examples:''
 VISUAL=mg

 VISUAL=vi

=Learning objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, for a single entity you will be able to 
* create a report specification entirely in XML for Cognos ReportNet
* update a report specification in XML format.
* identify four main sections in a report specification

=Introduction=

Every report created in Cognos ReportNet has a specification that is written in XML, so you can customize it using XML editor or create a report specification entirely in XML.  

=Report Specification Flow=

After you save a report and open it again,  the report specification is pulled from the content store as you can see in Figure 28.1.  When you edit it, the changes remain local on the client machine until you save it. When you save the report, the content store is updated.



Figure 28.1 Report Specification Flow

You can see a sample of web report  in figure 28.2 and this report can be generated from XML file;




Figure 28.2 Sample of a report


=XML in Report Specification Structure=
A report specification consists of four main sections.
* Report Section
** XML Tag: 
*** &lt;report&gt;
*** &lt;modelConnection&gt;
* Query Section
** XML Tag:
*** &lt;querySet&gt;
* Layout Section
** XML Tag:
*** &lt;layoutList&gt;
* Variable Section
** XML Tag:
*** &lt;variableList&gt;

At minimum, a report specification must include the &lt;report&gt;&lt;/report&gt; tags, as well as authoring language and schema information.


The specification header  in Report Section includes information about:
* authoring language, “en-us” indicates American English.  You can use other language than English  for the report
* namespace : http://developer.sample.com/schemas/report/1
* package name: GSR
* model version : @name='model'


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD bgcolor=&quot;lightyellow&quot;&gt;
&lt;report xml:lang=&quot;en-us&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://developer.sample.com/schemas/report/1/&quot;&gt;&lt;!--RS:1.1--&gt;
	&lt;modelConnection name=&quot;/content/package[@name='GSR']/model[@name='model']&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


The query section includes information about:
* Cube elements are indicated by the &lt;cube&gt;&lt;/cube&gt; tags which can contain: 
** facts (&lt;factList&gt;&lt;/factList&gt;. Country, First Name and Last Name are the facts.
** dimensions (&lt;dimension&gt;&lt;/dimension&gt;) consisting of levels(&lt;level&gt;&lt;/level&gt;)
** filters (&lt;filter&gt;&lt;/filters&gt; consiting of conditions(&lt;condition&gt;&lt;/conditions&gt;). Country is the filter    for this report, which is equal to Germany.
* Tabular model is contained in the &lt;tabularModel&gt;&lt;/tabularModel&gt; tags.
** Each tabular model contains data items (&lt;dataItem&gt;&lt;/dataItem&gt;) consisting of fully qualified expressions (&lt;expression&gt;&lt;/expression&gt;)
* The query section of a report is contained in the &lt;querySet&gt;&lt;/querySet&gt;tags.
* The query section can include multiple queries, each of which is contained in the   &lt;BIQuery&gt;&lt;/BIQuery&gt;tags.


Add pages to a report specification:
*You can add many pages to a report. Each page is outlined between the &lt;pageSet&gt; &lt;/pageSet&gt;tags.
** Each page can consist of :
***a body ( mandatory)
***a header
***a footer


Add layout objects to a report:
*Once you have added one or more pages to the report layout, you can add a variety of layout objects, such as : 
** Text items
** Blocks
** Lists
** Charts
** Crosstabs
** Tables


Specify styles for layout objects:
* You can use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attributes to determine the look and feel of objects in the layout.
* CSS values are specified between the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags.
* CSS values can apply to things like font sizes, background colors, and so forth.


Add Variables to a Report:
* You can specify variables between the &lt;variableList&gt;&lt;/variableList&gt; tags of the report specification., and each of variable includes an expression between the &lt;expression&gt;&lt;/expression&gt; tags. 
* We can use Variable 1 that contains a list of possible values, example value: fr for using French language;


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD bgcolor=&quot;lightyellow&quot;&gt;
        &lt;variableList&gt;
         &lt;variable name=”Variable1” type=”locale”&gt;
          &lt;expression&gt;ReportLocale()&lt;/expression&gt;
           &lt;variableValueList&gt;
            &lt;variableValue value=”fr”/&gt;
           &lt;/varialeValueList&gt;
          &lt;/variable&gt;
         &lt;/variableList&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;


Below is the complete XML file for the report in Figure 28.3

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Elementary Haskell}}
You're not restricted to working with just the types provided by default with the language. There are many benefits to defining your own types:

* Code can be written in terms of the problem being solved, making programs easier to design, write and understand. 
* Related pieces of data can be brought together in ways more convenient and meaningful than simply putting and getting values from lists or tuples. 
* Pattern matching and the type system can be used to their fullest extent by making them work with your custom types. 

Haskell has three basic ways to declare a new type:

* The &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; declaration, which defines new data types.
* The &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; declaration for type synonyms, that is, alternative names for existing types.
* The &lt;tt&gt;newtype&lt;/tt&gt; declaration, which defines new data types equivalent to existing ones.

In this chapter, we will study &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt;. In a later chapter, we will discuss &lt;tt&gt;newtype&lt;/tt&gt; and see where it can be useful. 

== &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; and constructor functions ==

&lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; is used to define new data types mostly using existing ones as building blocks. Here's a data structure for elements in a simple list of anniversaries:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Anniversary = Birthday String Int Int Int       -- name, year, month, day
                 | Wedding String String Int Int Int -- spouse name 1, spouse name 2, year, month, day
&lt;/source&gt;

This declares a new data type &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;, which can be either a Birthday or a Wedding.  A Birthday ''contains'' one string and three integers and a Wedding ''contains'' two strings and three integers. The definitions of the two possibilities are separated by the vertical bar. The comments explain to readers of the code about the intended use of these new types. Moreover, with the declaration we also get two ''constructor functions'' for &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;; appropriately enough, they are called &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Wedding&lt;/tt&gt;. These functions provide a way to build a new &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;.

Types defined by &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt; declarations are often referred to as ''algebraic data types'', which is something we will address further in later chapters.

As usual with Haskell, the case of the first letter is important: type names and constructor functions must start with capital letters. Other than this syntactic detail, constructor functions work pretty much like the &quot;conventional&quot; functions we met so far. In fact, if you use &lt;tt&gt;:t&lt;/tt&gt; in GHCi to query the type of, say, &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt;, you'll get:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; :t Birthday
Birthday :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Anniversary
}}

Meaning it's just a function which takes one String and three Int as arguments and ''evaluates to'' an &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;. This anniversary will contain the four arguments we passed as specified by the &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt; constructor.

Calling constructors is no different from calling other functions. For example, suppose we have John Smith born on 3rd July 1968:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
johnSmith :: Anniversary
johnSmith = Birthday &quot;John Smith&quot; 1968 7 3
&lt;/source&gt;

He married Jane Smith on 4th March 1987:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
smithWedding :: Anniversary
smithWedding = Wedding &quot;John Smith&quot; &quot;Jane Smith&quot; 1987 3 4
&lt;/source&gt;

These two anniversaries can, for instance, be put in a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
anniversariesOfJohnSmith :: [Anniversary]
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [johnSmith, smithWedding]
&lt;/source&gt;

Or you could just as easily have called the constructors straight away when building the list (although the resulting code looks a bit cluttered).

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [Birthday &quot;John Smith&quot; 1968 7 3, Wedding &quot;John Smith&quot; &quot;Jane Smith&quot; 1987 3 4]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Deconstructing types ==

To use our new data types, we must have a way to access their contents. For instance, one very basic operation with the anniversaries defined above would be extracting the names and dates they contain as a String. So we need a &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; function (for the sake of code clarity, we used an auxiliary &lt;tt&gt;showDate&lt;/tt&gt; function but let's ignore it for a moment):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
showDate :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; String
showDate y m d = show y ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show m ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show d

showAnniversary :: Anniversary -&gt; String

showAnniversary (Birthday name year month day) =
   name ++ &quot; born &quot; ++ showDate year month day

showAnniversary (Wedding name1 name2 year month day) =
   name1 ++ &quot; married &quot; ++ name2 ++ &quot; on &quot; ++ showDate year month day
&lt;/source&gt;

This example shows how we can deconstruct the values built in our data types.  &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; takes a single argument of type &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt;. Instead of just providing a name for the argument on the left side of the definition, however, we specify one of the constructor functions and give names to each argument of the constructor (which correspond to the contents of the Anniversary). A more formal way of describing this &quot;giving names&quot; process is to say we are ''binding variables''. &quot;Binding&quot; is being used in the sense of assigning a variable to each of the values so that we can refer to them on the right side of the function definition.

To handle both &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;Wedding&quot; Anniversaries, we needed to provide ''two'' function definitions, one for each constructor. When &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; is called, if the argument is a &lt;tt&gt;Birthday&lt;/tt&gt; Anniversary, the first definition is used and the variables &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;month&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;date&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;year&lt;/tt&gt; are bound to its contents. If the argument is a &lt;tt&gt;Wedding&lt;/tt&gt; Anniversary, then the second definition is used and the variables are bound in the same way. This process of using a different version of the function depending on the type of constructor is pretty much like what happens when we use a &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statement or define a function piece-wise.

Note that the parentheses around the constructor name and the bound variables are mandatory; otherwise the compiler or interpreter would not take them as a single argument. Also, it is important to have it absolutely clear that the expression inside the parentheses is ''not'' a call to the constructor function, even though it may look just like one.

{{Exercises|1=
''Note: The solution of this exercise is given near the end of the chapter, so we recommend that you attempt it before getting there.''&lt;/br&gt;
Reread the function definitions above. Then look closer at the &lt;tt&gt;showDate&lt;/tt&gt; helper function. We said it was provided &quot;for the sake of code clarity&quot;, but there is a certain clumsiness in the way it is used. You have to pass three separate Int arguments to it, but these arguments are always linked to each other as part of a single date. It would make no sense to do things like passing the year, month and day values of the Anniversary in a different order, or to pass the month value twice and omit the day.
* Could we use what we've seen in this chapter so far to reduce this clumsiness?
* Declare a &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; type which is composed of three Int, corresponding to year, month and day. Then, rewrite &lt;tt&gt;showDate&lt;/tt&gt; so that it uses the new Date data type. What changes will then be needed in &lt;tt&gt;showAnniversary&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;Anniversary&lt;/tt&gt; for them to make use of Date?.
}}

== &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; for making type synonyms ==

As mentioned in the introduction of this module, code clarity is one of the motivations for using custom types. In that spirit, it could be nice to make it clear that the Strings in the Anniversary type are being used as ''names'' while still being able to manipulate them like ordinary Strings. This calls for a &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; declaration:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type Name = String
&lt;/source&gt;

The code above says that a &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt; is now a synonym for a &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;. Any function that takes a &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; will now take a &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt; as well (and vice-versa: functions that take &lt;tt&gt;Name&lt;/tt&gt; will accept any &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;). The right hand side of a &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; declaration can be a more complex type as well. For example, &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; itself is defined in the standard libraries as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type String = [Char]
&lt;/source&gt;

We can do something similar for the list of anniversaries we made use of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type AnniversaryBook = [Anniversary]
&lt;/source&gt;

Type synonyms are mostly just a convenience. They help make the roles of types clearer or provide an alias to such things as complicated list or tuple types. It is largely a matter of personal discretion to decide how type synonyms should be deployed. Abuse of synonyms could make code confusing (for instance, picture a long program using multiple names for common types like Int or String simultaneously).

Incorporating the suggested type synonyms and the &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; type we proposed in the exercise(*) of the previous section the code we've written so far looks like this:
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
((*) '''last chance to try that exercise without looking at the spoilers.''')
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type Name = String

data Anniversary = 
   Birthday Name Date
   | Wedding Name Name Date

data Date = Date Int Int Int   -- Year, Month, Day

johnSmith :: Anniversary
johnSmith = Birthday &quot;John Smith&quot; (Date 1968 7 3)

smithWedding :: Anniversary
smithWedding = Wedding &quot;John Smith&quot; &quot;Jane Smith&quot; (Date 1987 3 4)

type AnniversaryBook = [Anniversary]

anniversariesOfJohnSmith :: AnniversaryBook
anniversariesOfJohnSmith = [johnSmith, smithWedding]

showDate :: Date -&gt; String
showDate (Date y m d) = show y ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show m ++ &quot;-&quot; ++ show d 

showAnniversary :: Anniversary -&gt; String
showAnniversary (Birthday name date) =
   name ++ &quot; born &quot; ++ showDate date
showAnniversary (Wedding name1 name2 date) =
   name1 ++ &quot; married &quot; ++ name2 ++ &quot; on &quot; ++ showDate date
&lt;/source&gt;

Even in a simple example like this one, there is a noticeable gain in simplicity and clarity compared to the same task using only Ints, Strings, and corresponding lists.

Note that the &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; type has a constructor function which is called &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; as well. That is perfectly valid and indeed giving the constructor the same name of the type when there is just one constructor is good practice, as a simple way of making the role of the function obvious.

{{body note|1=
After these initial examples, the mechanics of using constructor functions may look a bit unwieldy, particularly if you're familiar with analogous features in other languages. There are syntactical constructs that make dealing with constructors more convenient. These will be dealt with later on, when we return to the topic of constructors and data types to explore them in detail.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Luca1500. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Luca1500~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Workout==
For wrestling, submission/BJJ, or MMA, I like interval training, that is, doing a workout (whatever it happens to be) at an alternating aerobic and anaerobic pace. My goal, with regard to the conditioning element of a match, is to keep up a good aerobic pace with my opponent, of course forcing him to do the same in the process, then attack (anaerobic activity pressing such also on my opponent in response to me), then go back to an aerobic pace, repeating the process throughout the match. My thinking is that the winner conditioning-wise is the individual who can recover from an anaerobic burst back to an aerobic state to prepare for the next successful anaerobic burst or attack the quickest.

So when I train for competition I may, for example, roll with somebody at a typical solid aerobic pace for one minute, be very aggressive the next 30 seconds, go back to an aerobic pace for a minute, and so on. Or your could run (jog, sprint, jog, sprint, etc.) in a similar manner. Or your could to a hard takedown drill for two minutes and jog for one, repeating the process over and over. You get the picture.

Also, keep track of how many minutes of aerobic and anaerobic activity you are doing to increase it gradually and systematically so you know for sure how your training is going. It is not just the volume of training (more is not always better as you can overtrain) but also how you train whether you are talking technique, conditioning, or strength.


I generally try to maintain a modicum of noncompetition shape for general training (learning to improve the technical aspect of my game), although there have been times over the past couple of years that has simply not been possible. I like to cycle my training for both physical and mental preparation reasons. It has been my experience that you need to avoid the same routine all year else you get burned out and fail to progress maximally. It is my understanding that lifting ought to be done with some variably in order of exercise to avoid habituating the nervous system; at least that's what I was taught at Penn State some years ago.

I think that it is wise to take (at least, depending on what you are trying to accomplish in the competitive arena) one day off per week even if you are training intensely for competition, again for both physical and mental reasons. There are some people, including those who are very good, who probably overtrain. Mimicking them because &quot;they are champions&quot;, etc. is not necessarily the wisest thing to do as some people win in spite of (versus because of) how they train. For example, some people train (cardio or strength) like maniacs but may win owing to technical and mental factors (including because of the volume of training) although may not objectively be in maximal physiologic condition (e.g., weaker than they would have been without overtraining).

If you are training two or three times per week BJJ, wrestling, etc., I would suggest lifting on other days. As you &quot;ramp up&quot; your training for competition (especially serious competition) that level of training is not likely to be adequate so you will have to lift on days you are training. I think you are right on target keeping the hours between your strength and jiu jitsu training maximal (if you lift before BJJ). I lift in the morning before work and train BJJ in the evening. My view is that you will profit from improving the technical aspect of your game when you are relatively fresh and not having a major fatigue factor interfering with learning or ingraining new skills (i.e., if you are drill technique with which you are not particularly familiar or proficient while fatigued you are probably going to take longer to develop skillful technique). Being a pipsqueak and rolling with guys, some of who are twice my size, it is just too risky injury-wise to get a hard lift in before BJJ practice. If I am hurt, I cannot train or compete adequately.

One option, depending on your schedule, would be to lift after your BJJ practice if time is really tight, although not vice versa which I think is risky (when you roll in BJJ).

One thing that is crucial, I think, is to recognize that, over the long run, it is skill, not conditioning or strength, that will be the largest factor in success. That is not to say that cardio, strength, nutrition, psychological preparation, etc. are not important, just make sure that in your &quot;training portfolio&quot; that actual training (learning technique and sparring technique) does not become &quot;the odd man out.&quot; &quot;Major in the major subjects, minor in the minor subjects.&quot; The other things are to supplement, not substitute, the whole reason for what you do: BJJ.

Also, recognize when it is worthwhile to just take a day off, particularly from lifting. My experience has been that three times per week is best for most of my training cycle but that when things really ramp up for competition it is easy, simply by virtue of the volume of training to increase in the upswing in your training cycle, to get fatigued, dread practice, etc. At that point, wisdom is taking a day off from lifting (get a massage, etc.) and even consider lifting twice per week toward the end of your training cycle as you get close to competition so that the volume of doing what you will be doing in competition increases proportionally. I personally have found it helpful to lift two days per week freeweights and one day Nautilus with a trainer who busts my you-know-whats for a brutal hour (with substantial negative training). I make that guy earn his 35 bucks (none of this just yapping motivational crap)! If I feel fatigued or start to feel burned out, I chuck one of the freeweight days.

When training now, I like to go on a short run 5x/week (two or three miles) before lifting. I gradually add interval training to the run. I am best at wrestling, second best at BJJ, and weakest with my stand up. Therefore, in part because of inefficiency with my boxing, I find that an excellent cardio workout. I think that skills with which were are most proficient (read efficient) are a bit more of a challenge to push ourselves with. So boxing rounds with a partner holding mitts does me wonders, again, in part as I am less skilled and efficient (and therefore get more fatigued) with those techniques.

One exercise I like for cardio, strength, and mental reasons, and is easy to do in your BJJ room, is carrying a partner on my back around the perimeter of the room. You can do this in rounds with a brief walking break (i.e., to keep moving). This gets my heart rate through the roof if your partner (or instructor) can push and motivate you. You can do this to mimic rounds in a match or do the aerobic-anaerobic mix with your partner or coach telling you when to jog and when to sprint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Variables==
In programming a variable is simply a place to store data. A variable has a name and a data type. In Visual Basic .NET, a variable is declared using the Dim (short for Dimension) statement. Here is the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim varName As varType
&lt;/source&gt;

''varName'' is the name of your variable.

''varType'' is the data type of the variable. Types include string, integer, double, boolean, etc.

For example, to declare an integer named MyInt use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyInt As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;


By default, the variables case doesn't allow to distinguish them, so ''myint'' will automatically be converted in ''MyInt'' by the IDE if it's declared like that.

On the other hand, to make a program ignore the case in the string values, &lt;code&gt;Option Compare Text&lt;/code&gt; should be added.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Option Compare Text    ' By commenting this line the result becomes False
Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim string1 As String = &quot;a&quot;
        Dim string2 As String = &quot;A&quot;
        MsgBox(string1 = string2)
    End Sub
End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

===Data Types===
Data Types define the type of data that a variable can store. Some variables store numbers, others store names. The built-in VB.NET type aliases and their equivalent .NET Framework types follow:

====Integers====
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!VB Alias||.NET Type||Size||Range

|}

====Other pre-defined types====
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
!VB Alias||.NET Type||Size (bits)||Range
|-

|-
|Boolean||System.Boolean||32 bits (4 bytes)||True or False
|-
|Object||System.Object||32/64 bits (4/8 bytes)||Platform dependent (a reference to an object).

|}

==Using Variables==

===Assigning Values===


A value is the data contained in a variable.
To assign a value to a variable that is already declared, use an equal sign.

===Suffix for Literals===
Integral literals, such as 42 and 1000, are of type &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/font&gt; by default. String and character literals, such as &lt;font color=&quot;#A31515&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;#A31515&quot;&gt;&quot;À&quot;&lt;/font&gt;, are of type &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;String&lt;/font&gt; by default. To specify the type for a literal, suffixes are used. The suffixes are appended immediately after the literals, in the manner &amp;lt;literal&amp;gt;&amp;lt;suffix&amp;gt;, without any whitespace between.

===Examples===
For string and char variables, use double quotes around value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 strMyVariable = &quot;The String&quot;
 chrMyVariable = &quot;À&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
For date variables, use hashes/pounds around the value, in the format #&amp;lt;month&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;day&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;hour&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;minute&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;second&amp;gt; &amp;lt;AM|PM&amp;gt;#:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 dtMyVariable = #7/4/1776 12:01:50 PM#
&lt;/source&gt;

For all others, remove the quotes and hashes/pounds:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 bytMyVariable = 1
 sbytMyVariable = -2
 shrtMyVariable = 10S
 ushrtMyVariable = 10US
 intMyVariable = 100
 uintMyVariable = 100UI
 lngMyVariable = 1000L
 ulngMyVariable = 1000UL
 sngMyVariable = 1.234F
 dblMyVariable = 1.567R
 decMyVariable = 1234567.89D
 boolMyVariable = True
 objMyObject = New Object
&lt;/source&gt;

===Initial Value===

To assign a variable the value of another variable, simply replace the value on the right side of the equal sign with the name of the variable that holds the desired data.

You can also assign a value to a variable in the declaration itself.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim myVariable As String = &quot;StringValue&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Important:''' Visual Basic always assigns the value of the right variable to the left variable. The variable on the left takes the value of the right variable. The variable on the right does not change.

==Constants==
Constants are like variables that don't change. They take the place of values that you would not like to type over and over. Constants are declared using the keyword &quot;Const&quot;. Their values are defined in their declaration - they also use data types.
Here is the syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Const cnstMyConstant As String = &quot;The very long string&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Here is an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Const cnstPi As Single = 3.14159265F
&lt;/source&gt;
Constants are very useful when you need to type the same numbers/strings/etc many times.
For example, to convert from radians to degrees you can type 180/Pi constant:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Const cnstRadToDeg As Single = 57,29579143
&lt;/source&gt;
And use it like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Degrees = Radians / cnstRadToDeg
&lt;/source&gt;
This constant is useful in functions like Sin, Cos, Tan, Arctan, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Simple arrays==
An array is simply a variable that can store more then one piece of data. The data is stored in a list. If you declare an integer, then that variable can only store one integer. An array of integers can store many integers. Each one is given its own number. &lt;br/&gt;
For example, this line of code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray(5) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

will give an array like this

{|
|'''Index'''
|'''Data'''
|-
|00
|Nothing
|-
|01
|Nothing
|-
|02
|Nothing
|-
|03
|Nothing
|-
|04
|Nothing
|-
|05
|Nothing
|-
|}
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim arrayName(upperBound) As arrayType
&lt;/source&gt;

This is similar to declaring a normal variable with one difference, the upperBound argument. 
Unlike previous versions versions of Visual Basic, all arrays in Visual Basic .NET start at 0 and go to the upperBound, for Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray(10) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

will declare a variable called MyArray with space for 11 Integers.
The integers are stored in MyArray(0), MyArray(1),..., MyArray(10).

To declare an array and assign values in a single line, use the following
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray() As Integer = New Integer(4) { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way to create an array is as follows
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()

       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;c&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;d&quot;
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()

   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that anytime these lines are used:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Dim MyArray As System.Array
 MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

This means the same thing, and is easier to use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

The (''number'') after the name of the variable declares it as a string.

To access one of the elements in the array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()

       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;c&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;d&quot;
       Console.WriteLine(MyArray.GetValue(2)) 'returns c
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()

   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

How many elements do we have in the array?
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;c&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;d&quot;
       Console.WriteLine(MyArray.Length)
       'displays 4
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
       '    
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Display all the elements in the array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       '
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Sort the array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before sorting&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After sorting&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Sort in descending order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       Dim DescSortCompare = New DescSortCompareClass
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray, DescSortCompare)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
   '
   Public Class DescSortCompareClass
       Implements IComparer
       '
       Function Compare(ByVal x As Object, ByVal y As Object) As Integer _
          Implements IComparer.Compare
           Return x &gt; y
       End Function
       '
   End Class
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

Reverse the array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before reversing the array&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Reverse(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After reversing the array&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
   '
 End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

Now that we have &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;/code&gt;, here is another way to sort in descending order without &lt;code&gt;IComparer&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray(0) = &quot;a&quot;
       MyArray(1) = &quot;d&quot;
       MyArray(2) = &quot;b&quot;
       MyArray(3) = &quot;c&quot;
       '
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray)
       Array.Reverse(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

With Option Strict On, we would need to use SetValue to assign array elements.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Option Strict On
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
       '
       Dim MyArray As System.Array
       Dim En As System.Collections.IEnumerator
       MyArray = System.Array.CreateInstance(GetType(String), 4)
       '
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;a&quot;, 0)
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;d&quot;, 1)
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;b&quot;, 2)
       MyArray.SetValue(&quot;c&quot;, 3)
       '
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Before descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       Array.Sort(MyArray)
       Array.Reverse(MyArray)
       En = MyArray.GetEnumerator
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;After descending sort&quot;)
       Do While En.MoveNext
           Console.WriteLine(En.Current())
       Loop
       '
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

==Multi-Dimensional arrays==
Arrays also can be multi-dimensional - 2D, 3D, 4D etc.
For example, this line of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 'Declare an 2D Array with integers(X, Y)
 Dim My2DArray(2, 2) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

Will give an array like this:
{|
|'''Index'''
|'''Data'''
|-
|0, 0
|Nothing
|-
|0, 1
|Nothing
|-
|0, 2
|Nothing
|-
|1, 0
|Nothing
|-
|1, 1
|Nothing
|-
|1, 2
|Nothing
|-
|2, 0
|Nothing
|-
|2, 1
|Nothing
|-
|2, 2
|Nothing
|-
|}

2D arrays can be used in games like a Tic-Tac-Toe.

3D arrays can be thought of as an array of 2D arrays.  Where a 2D array has rows and columns, as in a game of Tic Tac Toe, the 3D array stores multiple grids of Tic Tac Toe.

To declare a 3D array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 'Declare an 3D Array of integers(X, Y)
 Dim My3DArray(1, 2, 2) As Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the first dimension would typically be the number of arrays in this 3D array.  We know these are 2D arrays as the second dimension specifies how many rows in these arrays and the third dimension the number of columns.

== Arrays manipulations methods ==
* &lt;code&gt;Split()&lt;/code&gt; : to transform a string into an array, according to the separator which is placed in parameter.
* &lt;code&gt;Join()&lt;/code&gt; : to convert an array into a string.
* &lt;code&gt;Filter()&lt;/code&gt; : to filter some array entries.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Module Module1
   Sub Main()
     Dim ArrayName() As String = Split(&quot;lorem ipsum dolor sit&quot;, &quot; &quot;)
     Console.WriteLine(ArrayName(1))  ' displays &quot;ipsum&quot;

     ArrayName(4) = &quot;amet&quot;
     Dim ArrayContent As String = String.Join(&quot; &quot;, ArrayName)
     Console.WriteLine(ArrayContent)

     Dim SubArray = Filter(ArrayName, &quot;o&quot;, True, CompareMethod.Text)
     Console.WriteLine(String.Join(&quot; &quot;, SubArray))  ' displays the words including &quot;o&quot;

     Console.ReadLine()
   End Sub
 End Module 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medieval art dates roughly from the period 500-1500 AD. 

European medieval art is generally centered around the architecture and icons of the Roman Catholic Church. The Christian Church grew from the fourth century onwards as the Roman empire collapsed. The pagan gods were no longer worshipped and such was the power of this new Christian religion that Iconoclasts destroyed early pagan statues and religious objects during the reign of Constantine, Emperor of Rome from 306 to 337. From the ashes of Classical Rome came a new Europe where the Christian Church became intricately entwined in the politics and economics of the day. Charlemagne (c. 742 – 814), a Frankish king, united Western Europe and was given the title &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot; (Imperator Augustus) by Pope Leo III on the 25 December 800 C.E. From this moment on the Christian Church and the State had forged a bond that would last for centuries.

== Romanesque ==
The Romanesque period refers roughly to the eleventh and first half of the twelfth centuries.  The term Romanesque was first given to this type of architecture in the 19th Century due to the use of round-headed arches and masonry barrel vaults, practices that had been common in ancient Roman architecture. The kinds of monuments that were sufficiently permanent to survive--mainly church buildings and sculpture--were commissioned by the Church.

Common characteristics of Romanesque architecture are thick, stone walls and large, exterior buttresses to support them, rounded arches, and barrel vaults.  The windows in these structures are usually small due to the restraints of using ashlar masonry.  The exteriors of Romanesque churches, as compared to the modular Carolingian and Ottonian churches of the ninth and tenth centuries, have unified decorative schemes of architectural and sculptural elements that unite the design as a whole.  These design elements include blind arcades, (rows of arches set flush against the wall's surface), and corbel tables, (series of arches mounted, not on columns, but on decorative stone brackets, called corbels), both of which often run around the entire perimeter; down the exterior nave wall, and around the transepts and apse, tying the structure together visually.

[[File:Psalm 24 Initial A.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th century manuscript page - Psalm 24]]

One major development of eleventh and twelfth-century architecture is the addition of increasingly elaborate programmes of figural sculpture on the exterior, particularly at the West end, usually the main entrance to the church.  Standing figures of sacred Biblical authors, such as prophets and apostles, as well as saints and Old Testament kings were placed against the walls beside the doorways, called jambs.  The arches over doorways, instead of being left open, were usually filled with semi-circular slabs of stone, called tympana (sing. tympanum).  The subject matter in the tympana was dominated by representations of the Last Judgment when, according to traditional teaching, Christ would return and divide the world into those who will receive eternal reward, and those who will be punished.  Romanesque sculpture is marked by a love of inventive surface patterns, and an expressive approach to the human body, using elongation, unnatural poses and emphatic gestures to convey states of mind.

Among smaller art forms, Romanesque manuscript illustrators continued to present full-page author portraits, for example, before the beginning of each Gospel book; but also elaborated the written word with historiated initials, that is, the first letter of a section drawn large, containing relevant figures or even narrative scenes; and marginal miniatures, the small scenes, sometimes fanciful and strange, drawn in the margins of the page.  Metalwork, and carved gems and ivory share some of the expressive and decorative qualities of monumental sculpture and manuscript painting.

== Gothic ==
Gothic architecture originated in southern France, around 1140, beginning with the innovative construction of the choir of Saint-Denis. Several characteristics mark Gothic architecture including the use of flying buttresses, elaborate stained-glass windows, ribbed vaults, pointed arches, and a distinct emphasis on verticality. 

'Several of these characteristics are exemplified in specific cathedrals:

'Flying buttresses: Notre Dame de Paris&lt;br&gt;
Stained Glass: Chartres Cathedral&lt;br&gt;
Distinct Verticality: Amiens Cathedral'

In contrast to the dark, claustrophobic Romanesque churches, Gothic cathedrals present a light, airy atmosphere due mainly to their ribbed vaults and flying buttresses which are able to support thinner walls, higher ceilings, and large, light filled windows.


== East Asian art, 500-1500 ==


== South Asian art, 500-1500 ==


== Islamic art to 1500 ==

From c. 670 to 1500, Islam expanded from its roots in modern-day Saudi Arabia to an empire stretching from Morocco to India. The spread of Islam throughout Eurasia was accompanied by the development of an artistic style which was closely related to Islam and its interpretation by regional dynasties. Islamic arts and architecture vary widely according to region but have a few unifying features. The Qur'an forbids depictions of the Prophet Muhammed and depictions of any person in religious art; therefore, Islamic artistic decoration is characterized by abstract floral and vegetal motifs rather than figural representation. Also, the Qu'ran discourages the construction of any building that would outlive its architect unless it serves Islam or the community in some way; therefore, surviving works, particularly works of architecture, tend to be public buildings like mosques, gardens and markets. (Palaces also frequently survive, although this could easily be because of the desire to preserve works of that quality of construction and decoration). Finally, the Arabic language, as the language of the Qur'an, is deeply embedded in Islamic artistic tradition; text is often featured as meaningful decoration in works of art and architecture.

This page summarizes the main features of the *BSD kernel and system, especially in comparison to other Unix-like systems. Currently, this page covers the free variants of *BSD, especially DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. There are also nonfree variants.

The Wikibook, [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]], gives an overview of BSD in its [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley Software Distribution]] chapter.

==General==
* The *BSD systems are descendants of AT&amp;T Unix (though non-free Unix code was removed) so they feel more like Unix than  GNU/Linux.  AT&amp;T had cheaply licensed the code to universities including Berkeley where major enhancements such as TCP/IP was then developed. The last BSD release from Berkeley had non-free code removed so more persons could use it. Today, the *BSD projects honor their ancestry putting BSD at the end of their names.
* The four big *BSD systems are '''free software''' and '''open source'''. While *BSD does use some copylefted GNU programs, most of *BSD is '''not copyleft''', which leaves everyone free to make non-free versions of *BSD and distribute binaries without source code. However, some parts of *BSD have extra terms in the license that annoy some people, and which are not found in the GNU licenses. In particular, there was enough dislike for the &quot;advertising clause&quot; (which requires marks on certain ads) that the Regents of the University of California removed it from their license; some other *BSD copyright holders still use the clause.
* The core system, including kernel and userland, is maintained in one CVS tree. This is similar to OpenSolaris and OpenDarwin, but GNU/Linux programs and kernels are in separate trees, and the development trees of non-free Unix-like systems are normally not public. Compare:
** DragonFly BSD http://www.dragonflybsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/
** FreeBSD http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/
** NetBSD http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/
** OpenBSD http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/
** OpenSolaris http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/
** OpenDarwin http://cvs.opendarwin.org/index.cgi/
* The *BSD sources are stored in '''/usr/src/''' and the kernel in '''/usr/src/sys/'''. The *BSD kernel and system programs are heavily integrated, and so must be upgraded together.

==Kernel==
* Recall that a ''kernel'' is the interface between programs and hardware. Unix-like kernels provide device drivers and networking support and allow multiple users and programs to share the system.
* The *BSD kernel (often installed at &quot;/bsd/&quot;) is ''monolithic'', which means that it is one program in one memory-addressing space. Thus the kernel avoids forming and sending messages between parts of itself.
** DragonFly BSD is changing some of this.
** The original AT&amp;T Unix and Linux are also monolithic, while mkLinux and the kernel of Mac OS X are modular.
* The kernel is actually the original AT&amp;T Unix with all of its files replaced. The BSD university project had added or replaced so much stuff (the VAX port, the networking features, the fast file system, ...) that *BSD projects could take the free parts and produce completely free kernels without needing a Unix license. A consequence of this is that the BSD kernel has a similar structure to commercial Unix kernels also descended from AT&amp;T Unix.
* The kernel contains a &quot;securelevel&quot; feature which attempts to permanently restrict what all users (including root, the superuser) can do after a certain point in the boot process.
* The kernel boot messages (also visible with '''dmesg''', on all Unix systems) are organized and shows where each device was detected.
** In contrast, the Linux drivers seem to give any boot messages that they feel like. The mounting and examining of &quot;/proc&quot; and &quot;/sys&quot;, or the use of tools like &quot;lspci&quot;, is a better strategy on Linux.

==Userland==
* Recall that ''userland'' consists of all the software above the kernel. This section describes the userland included with the base system.
* The programs in &lt;tt&gt;/bin/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/sbin/&lt;/tt&gt; are statically linked.
** This is because &lt;tt&gt;/usr/&lt;/tt&gt; might not be mounted, so the shared library &lt;tt&gt;/usr/lib/libc.so&lt;/tt&gt; cannot be used.
** ''Static linking'' is when each program is in one file, without the need for other files (shared libraries) containing code shared by programs. The library code is copied into the programs.
* The main text editor in the base system is &quot;vi&quot;. This is nvi included with BSD, and ultimately the original vi, and is not some other vi implementation such as vim. Actually, nvi is a clone of the original vi. The clone was necessary to remove some non-free Unix code.
** OpenBSD also includes &quot;mg&quot;, an editor resembling Emacs 17 but without any free but copylefted GNU code. FreeBSD includes &quot;ee&quot;, the &quot;easy editor&quot; with some similarities to [http://www.nano-editor.org/ nano] and [http://www.washington.edu/pine/ pico] (both of which are in the ports tree, although nano is free software and pico isn't).

== Ports ==
* There is a ports tree or packages tree originally from FreeBSD. This consists of Makefiles that automate the downloading, extracting, patching, and building of software for *BSD. This is the main way of installing stuff that is not part of the base system.
** On NetBSD this is called '''pkgsrc'''. A unique feature of the pkgsrc tree is that it also works on other operating systems. DragonFly BSD also uses pkgsrc.
** Thus installing a program is often two easy steps. First, type a &quot;cd&quot; command to the directory containing the port (for example, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/ports/games/nethack/&lt;/tt&gt;). Then, type a &quot;make install&quot; command and wait for everything to finish.
** Building software takes a long time, so many prefer to use a binary package instead of a &quot;make install&quot;.
* The system compiler is the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) with C, C++, Objective C, and Fortran 77.
** By default, gcc does not look in &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/&lt;/tt&gt; for header files and libraries; it only looks at the base system.
** The base system can rebuild itself with gcc.</text>

The core of Apple's Mac OS X (and its predecessor NextStep) is Darwin, which contains a lot of BSD code, especially FreeBSD 5 code.

==Background==
=== General ===
* Darwin, like other *BSD systems, is distributed as a complete Unix-like operating system, including the kernel, shell commands, C compiler, and other important utilities.
* Darwin is different from other *BSD systems. As listed below, it has several changes that the other *BSD systems lack.
* Darwin is named for [[wikipedia:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]].

=== Kernel ===
* ''Name:'' The kernel is called xnu. It consists of a modified Mach [[wikipedia:microkernel|microkernel]] and a &quot;server&quot; which is a port of the BSD kernel.
* ''Processor architecture:'' Mac OS X runs on both PowerPC- and Intel-based Macs
* ''Dualithic:'' The kernel uses a dualithic design. The Mach [[wikipedia:microkernel|microkernel]] contains device drivers, multitasking, and interprocess communication. Other kernel services, such as networking, filesystems, and traditional Unix system calls, must be provided by &quot;servers&quot;.
** Darwin uses one server, a port of the BSD kernel. Thus networking is similar to other *BSD systems and the UFS filesystem from BSD is also available. This is in contrast to GNU Hurd, which uses a difficult design consisting of many servers.
** NextStep probably introduced the dualithic design because Mach microkernel was more portable than BSD, or provided better multitasking benefits than BSD. They could port Mach to x86 and PowerPC. Since then, NetBSD has made *BSD very portable and created a monolithic NetBSD/macppc port. FreeBSD and OpenBSD are taking the NetBSD code for their Macintosh hardware ports.
** Apple (before it bought NextStep) used a similar strategy to port Linux, an x86 operating system, to PowerPC. The ''mkLinux'' (microkernel Linux) project started by porting Linux/x86 to use Mach. Then Mach was ported to Macintosh hardware. After Linux 2.0 appeared, Linux was more portable and the monolithic Linux/powerpc port displaced mkLinux. Apple bought NextStep and switched to using Darwin.
** The microkernel and server are tightly integrated. The microkernel expects the Darwin BSD server, so using another server, such as the mkLinux server, would be difficult.
* ''Device drivers:'' Because they are handled by Mach, device drivers are much different than in NetBSD/macppc. With Darwin, Apple made many replacements to the NextStep drivers.
** Darwin runs on any Mac the corresponding Mac OS X runs.
* ''HFS+ filesystem:'' Darwin also contains an implementation of the HFS+ filesystem introduced in Mac OS 8.1. It does not run on the classic Mac OS file system HFS used in in the Macintosh system software before Mac OS 8.1. HFS+, and not UFS, is the preferred filesystem for Darwin.

=== Userland ===
* ''GNU commands:'' Darwin replaces several BSD userland programs with their GNU equivalents; this makes Darwin feel more like GNU/Linux than BSD in several cases. In newer Darwin releases, GNU bash is the default shell, as it is on GNU/Linux.
* ''NetInfo:'' The NetInfo database has stored user and group information since the time of NextStep. The other *BSD systems use the traditional &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/etc/master.passwd&lt;/tt&gt; system instead. (The two files exist on Darwin, but typically do not contain normal users.)

=== Version Numbering ===
Apple labels the Darwin source code with version numbers that match Mac OS X version numbers.
* ''Jaguar:'' Darwin 6.''v'' = Mac OS 10.2.''v''
* ''Panther:'' Darwin 7.''v'' = Mac OS 10.3.''v''
* ''Tiger:'' Darwin 8.''v'' = Mac OS 10.4.''v''
* ''Leopard'': Darwin 9.''v'' = Mac OS 10.5.''v''

For example, the Darwin source code corresponding to Mac OS 10.4.3 is Darwin 8.3.

Why would anyone want to bind their own books?  Here are a few answers to that question, though this list is by no means exhaustive.

==Preservation==
With the right choice of binding techniques and materials, books can survive hundreds of years of gentle use.  Even mediocre books outlive most electronic storage media: magnetic tapes and disks lose their magnetization, and optical media such as CDs and DVDs are prone to oxidation of the metallic layer and degradation of any heat-sensitive dye.  The format of the printed word is immune to trends in editing software and advances in compression protocols.  Creating printed copies can preserve digital information for the long term.

Existing printed matter can also be preserved and made more usable by proper bookbinding techniques.  If a book is damaged, replacing the binding can be a relatively straightforward process.  Brittle, decayed paper can be replaced entirely, using a photocopier and some careful planning [http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/book/index.html]; the copied book can then be placed in a more durable, permanent binding.

==Creation==
Books can be works of visual art in their own right, regardless of their content.  Hopefully, the methods in this book will introduce more artists to this practical and beautiful medium.  Also, making one's own sketchbook, journal, photo album, or notebook often serves as an inspiration to capture other forms of expression with more energy and personality.

==Convenience==
Information is easy to find on the internet, but most people find that e-books, integrated circuit spec sheets [http://caladan.nanosoft.ca/book.php], professional journal articles, and many other materials are easier to use if they are printed out and bound together.  While stapling the top corner may be appropriate for thin documents that will be kept in a file folder and read only a few times, a little extra effort produces a volume that goes comfortably from bookshelf to backpack, and can be leafed through several times a day without worrying that the outside pages will fall off.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">1.  Dial condition--It is very difficult to improve the appearance of most watch dials. They are designed to be protected, and anything strong enough to remove dirt is also likely to remove markings or coatings.  Sometimes spot cleaning with a toothpick can reduce some marks, but it is just as likely to make things worse.  Watch dials can be &quot;redialed&quot;--This is basically repainted.  Quality can range from very good (although rarely as good as the original) to very obviously re-painted.  Prices begin at $20 or so, not counting removing the dial and shipping. 

2.  Case condition.  If a watch is gold-tone, check edges, lugs and high spots for missing plating.  If the gold has worn off, polishing will make it look good temporarily, but the brass underneath will soon tarnish--The transition from gold to brass can bee seen with a loupe. 

3.  Movement condition.  Mechanical watches should wind and set smoothly. There should be slight resistance when setting--If there is too little resistance, make sure the minute hand moves under its own power, and if it is a calendar (or jump-hour) manually turn the watch to where the calendar starts to move, then make sure the minute hand continues to move while advancing the calendar.   The movement should be clean inside, and the balance should be turning evenly and at least half a turn. 

4.  Crown.  Fairly easy to replace, but make sure you know how much your watchmaker charges first.  Manual wind watches with worn smooth crowns are especially irritating.  

5.  Crystal--This may be important, or may be a minor problem.  If the crystal is plastic and not cracked or discolored, most scratches can be [[Plastic crystal polishing|polished]] very easily. Domed round plastic crystals and flat glass crystals usually have generic replacemnt crystals readily available.  Fancy crystals can be difficult to find a match for.

A general note - don't feel rushed to buy the first watch that comes along.  In general, if you find one specific watch online that meets your criteria, then you will find more than one.  Shop around, and get a feel for price and the range of condition that your chosen model can be found in.  A common mistake is to buy an inferior watch, and then loose money on it later when you try to sell it to fund the purchase of one in better condition that comes along.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am Timothy J Scriven, I believe wikipedia can be a powerful source for social change by simply producing the unbiased truth. I live in NSW and of 2006 I am completing my HSC. My home is terrigal, a beautiful area.  

I worry about some of the directions wikipedia has taken in relation to the NPOV policy. I believe the policy should not be used as an excuse to place material's in articles which seems sympathetic to suicide, paedophilia etc. Furthermore I believe that wikipedia should, while keeping the NPOV policy in place in some form, favour current mainstream scientific opinion. While I can understand the rationale behind the NPOV policy I think it often makes for less, not more, encylopediac articles written in the style of “Some expert’s believe that this view point is wrong because...” “However it might be noted that...” “Some have argued that...” etc, which while following the letter do not follow the spirt of the NPOV policy. 

I'm passionately committed to: 

Saving the enviorment.
The rule of law. 
Fighting the emotional, sexual, mental and physical abuse of children. 
Freedom of speech. 
Preserving human rights and making culpable before international courts those who violate them. 
The importance of internet self regulation in addition to government regulation.
Legal reform so that the legal system better addresses the problem of moral luck. 
Combating police corruption. 
Upholding the importance of analytic skills.
Analytic Philosophy.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You might have heard of [[Open_Source|Open Source]], and perhaps you have heard about Mozilla Firefox, a new web browser, or of Linux, an alternative operating system to Windows; both attempt to challenge the mainstream software provided by the likes of Microsoft and, to a lesser extent, Apple. Open Source Software is not explicitly political - it has adherents across the political spectrum - but the method of development has led a number of theorists to suggest it is applicable to other areas of life. Moreover, it has the potential to change the way we work, govern ourselves and access the media.

This is a new area of study with an unstable lexicon, however, Lawrence Lessig - a professor at Stanford Law School, has dubbed the movement 'Free Culture', a term he borrowed from Richard Stallman's Free Software. Cooperation, Sharing, Global and Knowledge are its key concepts. In its most extreme (and idealistic) form, it is a system where everyone has a equal access to knowledge and information, where society would be free to live in a world of peace, discussion, tolerance, happiness, and understanding. Yes, this is the most idealistic view and we think that it is a goal that society should have. Even many of us claim that it is not possible, but we should strive for it.

This movement is spread through different subjects, the main ones of which are:

:*[[Open Culture/Information|Information]] (e.g., Wikipedia)
:*[[Open Culture/Technology|Technology]] (Linux, Mozilla)
:*[[Open Culture/Media|Media]]  (P2P, CreativeCommons)
:*[[Open Culture/Politics|Politics]] (www.opendemocracy.net)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first subject, '''Information''', is perhaps the oldest part of this movement. Gutenberg can be considered one of its earliest advocates, since he invented the printing press, allowing the public at large to read and become educated. Today, Open Information has grown phenomenally with the internet, which allows anybody online to access an immense wealth of knowledge.

More recently there have been more or less successful attempts to centralize open knowledge. Wikipedia, for example, is an online encyclopedia where anyone can contribute, correct, or complete articles. In April 2005 it had some 538,000 articles in English (and more than 940 articles added per day), making it larger than any other encyclopedia, printed or online.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technology''', the most visible part of the Open Culture movement can be most easily illustrated in the field of computer software and hardware.  

A branch of the Free Software movement known as Open Source software is a commonly-cited example.  As in all cases of &quot;free&quot; culture the free software and open source movements are founded on a premise whereby the user is not restricted in the use of the software.  The user is encouraged to build upon what has gone before without fear of being restricted by legal or ethical constraints.  

Many users of free software from around the world are able to contribute to the development of applications that are useful, so it is in effect not a single company that creates software for the customers but customers that contribute to making useful software for themselves  as part of a community.

The common examples include the various types of the GNU/Linux Operating System, the Mozilla suite of internet applications (Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, Seamonkey, and others), and the OpenOffice.org Office Suite.  Each of those applications have significant shares in their respective markets and may pose a threat to their traditional, proprietary competitors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Media''', another area of Open Culture, includes content-sharing such as Napster, and other P2P networks. It is very recent, mainly having come with the recent development of internet. These networks allow everyone to share their photos, music and videos so that everyone has access to all the media he would like and gives his own production to everyone.

What are the incentives to produce new media if one can't get any money out of it? Some incentives include communicating one's thoughts, beliefs and knowledge. And to be sure that one's work will at least have a reference to the author, one can use licenses like the ones that Creative Commons proposes.

mankind increasingly are going to be captured by media and this is &quot;'''media imperative'''&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many different websites and groups are promoting discussions about national or international politics, these are strong actors in the open culture movement, because they want to have everyone contribute to the different subjects to advance the general knowledge. Though this has been said to be a manifestation of left wing politics.

However, politically-oriented websites tend to attract politically opinionated individuals, and, as a result, Open Culture has not been as successful in such venues as might have been anticipated. For instance, Indymedia, regarded by some as Open, is regarded by many as a failure in that deletions and IP banning is performed by a closed group, and the Open publishing is exploited by parties who might better be deleted, but are not deleted, because the deletion powers vest in the closed groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It has long been realized that Lego blocks are much more than children's toys, they are grown up's toys as well. With the introduction of Technic Lego (c) and later on Mindstorms Lego (c) Lego became much more than static modeling. It became a live, multi-dimensional simulation. With Lego we can now reproduce much more than simple models of buildings and still objects, we can now make robots and moving modules that accurately represent the world.

LEGO Design has two forms: Creative and Instructional. Instructional building is done with detailed instructions as a guide. Lego Inc. supplies building instructions with all of their products which contain details of the different uses of the parts and tips on their use in creative designing. Creative design involves building without instructions, which requires a lot more creativity and at the end is the most valued type of design.

In this guide we give many instructional designs which were produced by Lego or submitted by independent designers. Alongside are also many tips on how to produce your own successful designs using your Lego at home.

Remember, the important thing is not to make the best model or accurately reproduce reality. The most important thing is to have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Official Lego(c) instructions ==

Usually, you might start out with a LEGO set that comes in a box and includes basic pieces, special pieces, and stickers.  In the box there is a set of instructions that details every aspect of the step by step building process.  You are almost guaranteed to build something that is sleek, uniform, and closely representative of something. It is recommended that you begin with simple instructions before moving on to the more advanced instructions which are usually found in larger sets.

PAY ATTENTION! Most Lego instructions are designed as step-by-step pictures which illustrate your progress through the stages. To move on to the next stage you must identify the pieces that were added to the new picture since the last one, and add the corresponding pieces to your own model. Many times there are little changes which easily evade the eye, much of the time changes are not easily identified, and other times pieces can be misidentified causing confusion as progress continues. Always pay close attention to the development of the pictures so that you identify the small changes. Lego isn't as difficult as origami, but the lack of clear instructions can make it just as irritating.

Note that many times extra pieces are included in Lego packages, so if you find extras after you've completed the model there is no real reason to panic.

== Fan instructions ==

The amazing invention of the internet has among many, many other things permitted the millions of Lego fans to come together and share their creative inventions with each other. Once you have mastered Official Lego models it is recommended that you check out different Lego fan sites where you can find thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of different models fitting almost every kind of budget. Most of these models do not have instructions, they are unique creations, but a search for &quot;custom LEGO instructions&quot; will find many that do.after doing it with the instructions try it without the instructions to get better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The beauty of LEGO is truly revealed when you start building without instructions.  It is best to start with a large collection of standard LEGO pieces (i.e. rectangles, squares, etc.) and an assortment of speciality pieces, perhaps acquired from demolished projects that used a box kit.  A large pool of standard pieces will allow you to use the colors you want and still have enough pieces, and the speciality pieces add the occasional design function you will need to express your creative ideas.

The design process usually starts with an idea.  Visualize what you want to build.  Start with the basics.  If you want to build a house, first design the framework.  After you have a frame, add a roof, and then exterior decorations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following are things you should (or ideally should) have:
* LEGO elements. LEGO is available either in bulk packages with a variety of bricks, plates, and other elements, or as sets which can be used to build the model on the box or other creations.
* Base-plates can usually be bought individually, although some come with sets. Like their name implies, they act as a base for models and help provide support. Base-plates are most available in 32x32 and 48x48, but various sizes, colors, and shapes exist. 
* Mini-figures add realism to LEGO models. They are generally included with some sets, and some special sets are released which are just mini-figures and accessories. Again, consider what you want to do before purchasing.
* If you are building a Technic model, wheels, axles, and other elements are included in LEGO Technic sets. An electric motor can be purchased separately to add motion to the model.
* If necessary, sets and parts can be purchased from the LEGO company's Shop-at-Home catalog, or from various web sites that buy and sell LEGO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several types of standard pieces, characterized and identified by the number of studs that piece contains. The &quot;studs&quot; are the little bumps on the top of almost every element in the LEGO system. A stud fits into grooves found on the bottom of almost every other element in the LEGO system. Obviously, a stud can only fit in a groove and vice versa, and so is the most basic understanding in building with LEGO.

This means that as such LEGO models can only be built &quot;one way up&quot;, but there are also special parts to work around this and allow for a variety of angular designs.

LEGO bricks are referred to by mathematical proportions much like timber; for example a &quot;2x4 brick&quot; is a brick that is 2 studs wide and four studs long. The 2x4 is the first and most common LEGO element of all. For most applications you will end up needing greater quantities of this brick than of any of the other elements.

There are two basic types of LEGO elements, &quot;bricks&quot; and &quot;plates&quot;. Put simply, bricks are the thick elements and plates are the thin ones; plates are always 1/3 of the height of a brick, so a mixture of plates and bricks can be used, but they still meet at the same height.

In special cases a plate-based part may be 2/3 of a brick, or a &quot;brick&quot; may actually be several bricks high itself, and these can allow for greater flexibility in construction.

LEGO pieces come in a wide variety of colors. Basic bricks and plates are available in around 64 colors, while some specialized elements only come in a few colors. Specialty chromed and glow-in-the-dark elements are also available, as well as transparent varieties of many of the solid colors.

Sometimes you want to build something that will not fall down if it gets bumped or dropped.  When you are building the walls of a house, for example, make sure you build it well.  Just like in a brick house, the bricks are not stacked right on top of each other.  They are staggered.  This gives strength to your building, and creates a strong foundation from which to build your creative incarnation.

Strength is important when building with LEGOs. In case it gets mis-handled while being moved or built, it might break. Hours of hard work could literally crumble away. A strong creation will last its part.

= Impressionism =

Photography in the nineteenth century both challenged painters to be true to nature and encouraged them to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like color, that photography lacked. This divergence away from photographic realism appears in the work of a group of artists who from 1874 to 1886 exhibited together, independently of the Salon. The leaders of the independent movement were Claude Monet, August Renoir, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, and Mary Cassatt. They became known as Impressionists because a newspaper critic thought they were painting mere sketches or impressions. The Impressionists, however, considered their works finished. 
Many Impressionists painted pleasant scenes of middle class urban life, extolling the leisure time that the industrial revolution had won for middle class society. In Renoir's luminous painting Luncheon of the Boating Party, for example, young men and women eat, drink, talk, and flirt with a joy for life that is reflected in sparkling colors. The sun filtered through the orange striped awning colors everything and everyone in the party with its warm light. The diners' glances cut across a balanced and integrated composition that reproduces a very delightful scene of modem middle class life. 

[[File:BoatingParty-PhillipsCollection-IMG 0066.jpg|thumb|Luncheon of the Boating Party by Renoir (1881)]]

Since they were realists, followers of Courbet and Manet, the Impressionists set out to be &quot;true to nature,&quot; a phrase that became their rallying cries. When Renoir and Monet went out into the countryside in search of subjects to paint, they carried their oil colors, canvas, and brushes with them so that they could stand right on the spot and record what they saw at that time. In contrast, most earlier landscape painters worked in their studio from sketches they had made outdoors. 
The more an Impressionist like Monet looked, the more she or he saw. Sometimes Monet came back to the same spot at different times of day or at a different time of year to paint the same scene. In 1892 he rented a room opposite the Cathedral of Rouen in order to paint its facade over and over again. He never copied himself because the light and color always changed with the passage of time, and the variations made each painting a new creation. The differences are obvious when we compare the painting of Rouen Cathedral that is now in Switzerland with the one that is now in Washington, D.C. 
Realism meant to an Impressionist that the painter ought to record the most subtle sensations of reflected light. In capturing a specific kind of light, this style conveys the notion of a specific and fleeting moment of time. Impressionist painters like Monet and Renoir recorded each sensation of light with a touch of paint in a little stroke like a comma. The public back then was upset that Impressionist paintings looked like a sketch and did not have the polish and finish that more fashionable paintings had. But applying the paint in tiny strokes allowed Monet, Renoir, or Cassatt to display color sensations openly, to keep the colors unmixed and intense, and to let the viewer's eye mix the colors. The bright colors and the active participation of the viewer approximated the experience of the scintillation of natural sunlight. 
The Impressionists remained realists in the sense that they remained true to their sensations of the object, although they ignored many of the old conventions for representing the object &quot;out there.&quot; But truthfulness for the Impressionists lay in their personal and subjective sensations not in the &quot;exact&quot; reproduction of an object for its own sake. The objectivity of things existing outside and beyond the artist no longer mattered as much as it once did. The significance of &quot;outside&quot; objects became irrelevant. Concern for representing an object faded, while concern for representing the subjective grew. The focus on subjectivity intensified because artists became more concerned with the independent expression of the individual. Reality became what the individual saw. With Impressionism, the meaning of realism was transformed into subjective realism, and the subjectivity of modem art was born.

==Camille Pissarro (1830-1903)==
 
Born July 10, 1830 in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. His father, a Portuguese Jew, ran a general store. Although Pissarro attended school in Paris and demonstrated an exceptional talent for drawing, he returned to St. Thomas in 1847 to work in the family business. During the ensuing years his interest in art persisted, and in 1855 his parents finally yielded to his ambition to become a painter. 

Pissarro reached Paris in time to see the important World's Fair of 1855. He was particularly impressed by the landscapes of Camille Corot and other members of the Barbizon group, who had taken the first steps toward working directly from nature, and by the ambitious and forthright realism of Gustave Courbet, although his own work increasingly gravitated toward landscape rather than figurative subjects.

During the next 10 years, Pissarro received some academic training at the École des Beaux-Arts, but he spent most of his time at the Académie Suisse, where free classes were offered. This was an important gathering place for those artists whose ambitions and sensibilities lay outside the teaching of the official schools, for it offered greater opportunity to discuss and develop personal ideas about painting and art in general. In this setting Pissarro became friends with Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Paul Cézanne, who were seeking alternatives to the established methods of painting. Pissarro's works at this time were occasionally, though by no means consistently, accepted at the annual Salons. More importantly, however, he received critical backing and encouragement from the journalist and critic Émile Zola.
 
During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-7, Pissarro and Monet went to London, where they were impressed by the landscape paintings of John Constable and J.M.W. Turner. By this time Pissarro and Monet had begun to work directly from nature and to develop the unique style that would later be called Impressionism. In their pursuit of this new and revolutionary direction, the lessons of the earlier English landscapists provided crucial and much-needed support, particularly in terms of the loose handling of paint, the abstractness, and the strong response to nature that characterized their own paintings. When Pissarro returned to his home at Louveciennes near Paris, he found that the Prussians had destroyed nearly all of his paintings. 

By the early 1870s, the work of Pissarro and his colleagues had been rejected by the Salon, France's official state-run art show, on repeated occasions. In 1874, they held their own exhibition, a show of &quot;independent&quot; artists, which included the work of Pissarro, Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Edgar Degas, and Berthe Morisot. This was the first Impressionist exhibition (the term &quot;Impressionist,&quot; originally used derisively, was actually coined by a newspaper critic). There were seven similar exhibitions from 1874-86, and Pissarro was the only artist who participated in all eight. This fact is important because it reveals something about Pissarro's relation to Impressionism generally: he was the patriarch and teacher of the movement, constantly advising younger artists, introducing them to one another, and encouraging them to join the revolutionary trend that he helped to originate. 
In 1892, a large retrospective of Pissarro's work finally brought him the international recognition he deserved. Characteristic paintings are Path through the Fields (1879), Landscape, Eragny (1895), and Place du Théâtre Français (1898). He died in Paris on November 12, 1903. Although his work was generally less innovative than that of his major contemporaries, his contributions as an artist should not be underestimated in the development of the Impressionist painting style.


==Edgar Degas (1834-1917)==

Born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas on July 19, 1834, in Paris, France. A member of an upper-class family (his father was a banker), Degas was originally intended to practice law, which he studied for a time after finishing secondary school. In 1855, however, he enrolled at the famous École des Beaux-Arts, or School of Fine Arts, in Paris, where he studied under Louis Lamothe, a pupil of the classical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. 
In order to supplement his art studies, Degas traveled extensively, including trips to Naples, Florence, and Rome (where he lived for three years), in order to observe and copy the works of such Renaissance masters as Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna, and Nicolas Poussin. From his early classical education, Degas learned a good deal about drawing figures, a skill he used to complete some impressive family portraits before 1860, notably The Belleli Family (1859). 
In 1861, Degas returned to Paris, where he executed several &quot;history paintings,&quot; or works with historical or Biblical themes, which were then the most sought-after paintings by serious art patrons and particularly the prestigious state-run art show, the Salon, held each year in Paris. He also began copying works by the Old Masters from the Louvre, which he would continue doing for many years. With his historical paintings (including 1861's Daughter of Jephthah, based on an incident from the Old Testament) and his finely-wrought portraits of friends, family members, and clients, the young Degas quickly established a reputation among French art circles and never suffered from the financial problems that plagued many of his contemporaries. 

[[File:Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas 021.jpg|thumb|right|''The Dance Class'' (La Classe de Danse)  by Edgar Degas (1873–1876)]]

Soon, however, Degas began to shift his focus from historical painting to depictions of life in contemporary Paris. By 1862, he had begun painting various scenes from the racecourse, including studies of the horses, their mounts, and the fashionable spectators. Degas' style after the early 1860s was influenced by the budding Impressionist movement, including his friendship with Édouard Manet, as well as his introduction to Japanese graphic art, with its striking representation of figures. Along with his work painting scenes from the racetrack, Degas began concentrating on portraits of groups, most notably of female ballet dancers, who became Degas' most famous subjects.
Degas served in the artillery division of the French National Guard during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. Upon his return, he worked on even more ambitious studies of groups, often in motion, in both indoor and outdoor settings. In October 1872, Degas visited the United States for five months, spending time in New Orleans, Louisiana, where some members of his family were in the cotton business. From this experience came his famous painting New Orleans Cotton Office (1873).

Many of Degas' paintings featured the artist's experiments with unorthodox visual angles and asymmetrical perspectives, somewhat like a photographer's treatment of a subject. Examples of this style are A Carriage at the Races (1872), which features a human figure who is almost cut in half by the edge of the canvas, and Ballet Rehearsal (1876), a group portrait of ballerinas that appears almost cropped at the edges. From 1873 to 1883, Degas produced many of his most famous works, both paintings and pastels, of his favorite subjects, including the ballet, the racecourse, the music hall, and café society. 
Though he never suffered from lack of money or interest in his work, Degas stopped exhibiting at the Salon in 1874, and thereafter displayed most of his works alongside those of the other Impressionists, including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro. His strong focus on draftsmanship, portraiture, and composition distanced him from the rest of the artists identified as Impressionists.

Sometime in the 1870s, Degas began to suffer a loss of vision, which limited his ability to work. He began increasingly to work as a sculptor, producing bronze statues of horses and ballet dancers, among other subjects. A number of his sculptures, including Little Dancer Aged Fourteen (1880-81), were figures dressed in real costumes, and many of them captured the moment of transition between one position to another, giving the statues a real sense of immediacy and motion.
As Degas' eyesight grew worse, he became an increasingly reclusive and eccentric figure. In the last years of his life, he was almost totally blind. Edgar Degas died on September 27, 1917, in Paris, leaving behind in his studio an important collection of drawings and paintings by his contemporaries as well as a number of statues crafted in wax and metal, which were cast in bronze after his death.

==Claude Monet (1840-1926)==

Born November 14, 1840, in Paris, France. Claude Monet was a seminal figure in the evolution of Impressionism, a pivotal style in the development of modern art. In 1845 his family moved to Le Havre, and by the time he was 15, Monet had developed a local reputation as a caricaturist. Through an exhibition of his caricatures in 1858, Monet met Eugène Boudin, a landscape painter who exerted a profound influence on the young artist. Boudin introduced him to outdoor painting, an activity that he entered reluctantly but which soon became the basis for his life's work. 
By 1859 Monet was determined to pursue an artistic career. He visited Paris and was impressed by the paintings of Eugène Delacroix, Charles Daubigny, and Camille Corot. Against his parents' wishes, Monet decided to stay in Paris. He worked at the free Académie Suisse, where he met Camille Pissarro, and he frequented the Brasserie des Martyrs, a gathering place for Gustave Courbet and other realists who constituted the vanguard of French painting in the 1850s. 
Formative Period

Monet's studies were interrupted by military service in Algeria from 1860 to 1862. The remainder of the decade witnessed constant experimentation, travel, and the formation of many important artistic friendships. In 1862, he entered the studio of Charles Gleyre in Paris and met Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille. During 1863 and 1864, he periodically worked in the forest at Fontainebleau with the Barbizon artists Théodore Rousseau, Jean François Millet, and Daubigny, as well as with Corot. In Paris in 1869, he frequented the Café Guerbois, where he met Édouard Manet. 
At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Monet traveled to London, where he met the adventurous and sympathetic dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. The following year Monet and his wife, Camille, whom he had married in 1870, settled at Argenteuil, which became a semi-permanent home (he continued to travel throughout his life) for the next six years. 
Monet's constant movements during this period were directly related to his artistic ambitions. The phenomena of natural light, atmosphere, and color captivated his imagination, and he committed himself to an increasingly accurate recording of their enthralling variety. He consciously sought that variety and gradually developed a remarkable sensitivity for the subtle particulars of each landscape he encountered. Paul Cézanne is reported to have said, &quot;Monet is the most prodigious eye since there have been painters.&quot; 
Relatively few of Monet's canvases from the 1860s have survived. Throughout the decade, and during the 1870s as well, he suffered from extreme financial hardship and frequently destroyed his own paintings rather than have them seized by creditors. A striking example of his early style is Terrace at Sainte-Adresse (1867). The painting contains a shimmering array of bright, natural colors, eschewing completely the somber browns and blacks of the earlier landscape tradition. 

===Monet and Impressionism===
 
As William Seitz wrote in 1960, &quot;The landscapes Monet painted at Argenteuil between 1872 and 1877 are his best-known, most popular works, and it was during these years that Impressionism most closely approached a group style. Here, often working beside Renoir, Sisley, Caillebotte, or Manet, he painted the sparkling impressions of French river life that so delight us today.&quot; During these same years, Monet exhibited regularly in the Impressionist group shows, the first of which took place in 1874. On that occasion his painting Impression: Sunrise (1872) inspired a hostile newspaper critic to call all the artists &quot;Impressionists,&quot; and the designation has persisted to the present day. 

[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant) by Monet (1872)]]

Monet's paintings from the 1870s reveal the major tenets of the Impressionist vision. Along with Impression: Sunrise, Red Boats at Argenteuil (1875) is an outstanding example of the new style. In these paintings, Impressionism is essentially an illusionist style, albeit one that looks radically different from the landscapes of the Old Masters. The difference resides primarily in the chromatic vibrancy of Monet's canvases. Working directly from nature, he and the other Impressionists discovered that even the darkest shadows and the gloomiest days contain an infinite variety of colors. To capture the fleeting effects of light and color, however, Monet gradually learned that he had to paint quickly and to employ short brushstrokes loaded with individualized colors. This technique resulted in canvases that were charged with painterly activity; in effect, they denied the even blending of colors and the smooth, enameled surfaces to which earlier painting had persistently subscribed. 

Yet, in spite of these differences, the new style was illusionistically intended; only the interpretation of what illusionism consisted of had changed. For traditional landscape artists, illusionism was conditioned first of all by the mind: that is, painters tended to depict the individual phenomena of the natural world-leaves, branches, blades of grass-as they had studied them and conceptualized their existence. Monet, on the other hand, wanted to paint what he saw rather than what he intellectually knew. And he saw not separate leaves, but splashes of constantly changing light and color. According to Seitz, &quot;It is in this context that we must understand his desire to see the world through the eyes of a man born blind who had suddenly gained his sight: as a pattern of nameless color patches.&quot; In an important sense, then, Monet belongs to the tradition of Renaissance illusionism: in recording the phenomena of the natural world, he simply based his art on perceptual rather than conceptual knowledge. 

During the 1880s, the Impressionists began to dissolve as a cohesive group, although individual members continued to see one another and they occasionally worked together. In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny, but he continued to travel-to London, Madrid, and Venice, as well as to favorite sites in his native country. He gradually gained critical and financial success during the late 1880s and the 1890s. This was due primarily to the efforts of Durand-Ruel, who sponsored one-man exhibitions of Monet's work as early as 1883 and who, in 1886, also organized the first large-scale Impressionist group show to take place in the United States. 

Monet's painting during this period slowly gravitated toward a broader, more expansive and expressive style. In Spring Trees by a Lake (1888) the entire surface vibrates electrically with shimmering light and color. Paradoxically, as his style matured and as he continued to develop the sensitivity of his vision, the strictly illusionistic aspect of his paintings began to disappear. Plastic form dissolved into colored pigment, and three-dimensional space evaporated into a charged, purely optical surface atmosphere. His canvases, although invariably inspired by the visible world, increasingly declared themselves as objects that are, above all, paintings. This quality links Monet's art more closely with modernism than with the Renaissance tradition.

Modernist, too, are the &quot;serial&quot; paintings to which Monet devoted considerable energy during the 1890s. The most celebrated of these series are the haystacks (1891) and the façades of Rouen Cathedral (1892-1894). In these works Monet painted his subjects from more or less the same physical position, allowing only the natural light and atmospheric conditions to vary from picture to picture. That is, he &quot;fixed&quot; the subject matter, treating it like an experimental constant against which changing effects could be measured and recorded. This technique reflects the persistence and devotion with which Monet pursued his study of the visible world. At the same time, the serial works effectively neutralized subject matter per se, implying that paintings could exist without it. In this way his art established an important precedent for the development of abstract painting.

===Late Work===
 
Monet's wife died in 1879; in 1892 he married Alice Hoschedé. By 1899 his financial position was secure, and he began work on his famous series of water lily paintings. Water lilies existed in profusion in the artist's exotic gardens at Giverny, and he painted them tirelessly until his death there on December 5, 1926. Monet's late years were by no means easy. During his last two decades, he suffered from poor health and had double cataracts; by the 1920s, he was virtually blind. 
In addition to his physical ailments, Monet struggled desperately with the problems of his art. In 1920, he began work on 12 large canvases (each measuring 14 feet in width) of water lilies, which he planned to give to the state. To complete them, he fought against his own failing eyesight and against the demands of a large-scale mural art for which his own past had hardly prepared him. In effect, the task required him to learn a new kind of painting at the age of 80. The paintings are characterized by a broad, sweeping style; virtually devoid of subject matter, their vast, encompassing spaces are generated almost exclusively by color. Such color spaces were without precedent in Monet's lifetime; and moreover, their descendants have appeared in contemporary painting only since the end of World War II. 

==Berthe Morisot (1841-1895)==

[[File:Edouard Manet 040.jpg|thumb|Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets by Manet (1872)]]

Born January 14, 1841, in Bourges, France. The daughter of a high-ranking government official and granddaughter of the influential Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot began studying painting alongside her sister Edma when both were young. Though women were not allowed to join official arts institutions, like schools, until the last few years of the nineteenth century, Morisot and her sister earned a certain measure of respect within art circles for their budding talent. 
After copying masterpieces from the Louvre Museum in the late 1850s under Joseph Guichard, Berthe and Edma began painting outdoor scenes while studying with the well-known landscape painter Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot. Berthe Morisot worked with Corot, who became a family friend, from 1862 to 1868. She first exhibited her paintings at the prestigious state-run art show, the Salon, in 1864, and her work was shown there regularly for the next decade..

Morisot was greatly influenced by her friendship with Édouard Manet, to whom she was introduced in 1868 by their fellow artist Henri Fantin-Latour. Though Morisot was never a pupil of Manet's, she soon abandoned aspects of Corot's teachings and destroyed almost all of her early work in favor of a more unconventional and modern approach, with the encouragement of Manet and others, including Edgar Degas and Frédéric Bazille. She also played an important role in Manet's career, posing for a number of his paintings-notably The Balcony (1869) and Repose (c. 1870) - and encouraging him to adapt some tenets of Impressionism into his work.
 
 
Beginning in 1874, Morisot refused to show her work at the Salon, choosing to join a fledgling group of Impressionist painters that included Degas, who would become Morisot's lifelong friend, as well as Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, and Alfred Sisley. Morisot agreed to take part in the first independent exhibition of Impressionist paintings, which opened in a photographer's studio on Paris's Boulevard des Capucines in April 1874. In doing so, she went against the advice of Édouard Manet, who refused to exhibit with the Impressionists and was determined to make his name at the Salon. Among the paintings she showed at the exhibition were The Cradle, The Harbor at Cherbourg, Hide and Seek, and Reading. 
In December 1874, at the age of 33, Morisot married Manet's younger brother, Eugène, also a painter. Eugène Manet supported his wife in her work and the marriage gave Morisot social and financial stability while she continued her painting career. On a census form, Morisot famously recorded herself as &quot;without profession,&quot; underscoring her vision of her life and work within, not outside of, the traditional feminine sphere. She participated in all of the Impressionist exhibitions save one, in 1877, when she was pregnant with her daughter, Julie, born in 1878. 

Morisot painted in oils, watercolors, and pastels, and produced numerous drawings. Her wide range of subjects included portraits (many of her sister Edma), landscapes, still lives, and the domestic scene, particularly traditional feminine occupations. A particularly notable example of the latter was Woman at Her Toilette (c. 1879), which she displayed in the fifth Impressionist exhibition in 1880. For some of her later works, Morisot noticeably changed her style, making numerous sketches of a subject before beginning a painting rather than relying on spontaneous observation, as in her earlier work. Paintings that showcased her new style included The Cherry Tree (1891-92) and Girl with a Greyhound (1893).
Eugène Manet died in April 1892, after a long illness. Morisot's friends and fellow artists rallied around her and her young daughter Julie, and she continued to work. Though never commercially successful during her lifetime, Morisot outsold several of her fellow Impressionists, including Monet, Renoir, and Sisley. She had her first solo exhibition in 1892 at the Boussod and Valadon gallery, where she sold a number of works, and she earned further recognition in 1894, when the French government purchased her oil painting Young Woman in a Ball Gown.
In the winter of 1894-95, Morisot contracted pneumonia. She died on March 2, 1895, at the age of 54. After her death, Renoir and Degas organized a retrospective of her work, which garnered serious critical acclaim and ensured her place in art history as one of the founding members of the revolutionary Impressionist movement.

==Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919)==
 
Born February 25, 1841, in Limoges, France. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Paris. Because he showed a remarkable talent for drawing, Renoir became an apprentice in a porcelain factory, where he painted plates. Later, after the factory had gone out of business, he worked for his older brother, decorating fans. Throughout these early years, Renoir made frequent visits to the Louvre, where he studied the art of earlier French masters, particularly those of the 18th century-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher, and Jean Honoré Fragonard. His deep respect for these artists informed his own painting throughout his career. 
During the 1870s, a revolution erupted in French painting. Encouraged by artists like Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, a number of young painters began to seek alternatives to the traditions of Western painting that had prevailed since the beginning of the Renaissance. These artists went directly to nature for their inspiration and into the actual society of which they were a part. As a result, their works revealed a look of freshness and immediacy that in many ways departed from the look of Old Master painting. The new art, for instance, displayed vibrant light and color instead of the somber browns and blacks that had dominated previous painting. These qualities, among others, signaled the beginning of modern art. 

==Early Career==
In 1862, Renoir decided to study painting seriously and entered the Atelier Gleyre, where he met Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Jean Frédéric Bazille. During the next six years, Renoir's art showed the influence of Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, the two most innovative painters of the 1850s and 1860s. Courbet's influence is especially evident in the bold palette-knife technique of Diane Chasseresse (1867), while Manet's can be seen in the flat tones of Alfred Sisley and His Wife (1868). Still, both paintings reveal a sense of intimacy that is characteristic of Renoir's personal style. 
 
The 1860s were difficult years for Renoir. At times he was too poor to buy paints or canvas, and the Salons of 1866 and 1867 rejected his works. The following year the Salon accepted his painting Lise. He continued to develop his work and to study the paintings of his contemporaries-not only Courbet and Manet, but Camille Corot and Eugène Delacroix as well. Renoir's indebtedness to Delacroix is apparent in the lush painter like that of the Odalisque (1870). 
Renoir and Impressionism
In 1869, Renoir and Monet worked together at La Grenouillère, a bathing spot on the Seine. Both artists became obsessed with painting light and water. According to Phoebe Pool (1967), this was a decisive moment in the development of Impressionism, for &quot;It was there that Renoir and Monet made their discovery that shadows are not brown or black but are colored by their surroundings, and that the 'local color' of an object is modified by the light in which it is seen, by reflections from other objects and by contrast with juxtaposed colors.&quot; 
The styles of Renoir and Monet were virtually identical at this time, an indication of the dedication with which they pursued and shared their new discoveries. During the 1870s, they still occasionally worked together, although their styles generally developed in more personal directions. 
In 1874, Renoir participated in the first Impressionist exhibition, along with Monet, Edgar Degas, Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro, and Berthe Morisot. His works included The Opera Box (1874), a painting that shows the artist's penchant for rich and freely handled figurative expression. Of all the Impressionists, Renoir most consistently and thoroughly adapted the new style-in its inspiration, essentially a landscape style-to the great tradition of figure painting. 

Although the Impressionist exhibitions were the targets of much public ridicule during the 1870s, Renoir's patronage gradually increased during the decade. He became a friend of Caillebotte, one of the first patrons of the Impressionists, and he was also backed by the art dealer Durand-Ruel and by collectors like Victor Choquet, the Charpentiers, and the Daidets. The artist's connection with these individuals is documented by a number of handsome portraits, for instance, Madame Charpentier and Her Children (1878).
 
In the 1870s, Renoir also produced some of his most celebrated Impressionist genre scenes, including The Swing and The Ball at the Moulin de la Galette (both 1876). These works embody his most basic attitudes about art and life. They show men and women together, openly and casually enjoying a society diffused with warm, radiant sunlight. Figures blend softly into one another and into their surrounding space. Such worlds are pleasurable, sensuous, and generously endowed with human feeling. 

===Renoir's &quot;Dry&quot; Period===

During the 1880s, Renoir gradually separated himself from the other Impressionists, largely because he became dissatisfied with the direction the new style was taking in his own hands. In paintings like The Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881), he felt that his style was becoming too loose, that forms were losing their distinctiveness and sense of mass. As a result, he looked to the past for a fresh inspiration. In 1881, he traveled to Italy and was particularly impressed by the art of Raphael. 
During the next six years, Renoir's paintings became increasingly dry: he began to draw in a tight, classical manner, carefully outlining his figures in an effort to give them plastic clarity. The works from this period, such as The Umbrellas (1883) and Les grandes baigneuses (1884-1887), are generally considered the least successful of Renoir's mature expressions. Their classicizing effort seems self-conscious, a contradiction to the warm sensuality that came naturally to him. 

===Late Career===
By the end of the 1880s, Renoir had passed through his dry period. His late work is truly extraordinary: a glorious outpouring of monumental nude figures, beautiful young girls, and lush landscapes. Examples of this style include The Music Lesson (1891), Young Girl Reading (1892), and Sleeping Bather (1897). In many ways, the generosity of feeling in these paintings expands upon the achievements of his great work in the 1870s. 
Renoir's health declined severely in his later years. In 1903, he suffered his first attack of rheumatoid arthritis and settled for the winter at Cagnes-sur-Mer. By this time he faced no financial problems, but the arthritis made painting painful and often impossible. Nevertheless, he continued to work, at times with a brush tied to his crippled hand. Renoir died at Cagnes-sur-Mer on December 3, 1919, but his death was preceded by an experience of supreme triumph: the state had purchased his portrait Madame Georges Charpentier (1877), and he traveled to Paris in August to see it hanging in the Louvre.

==Edouard Manet (1832-1883)==
 
Born January 23, 1832 in Paris, France, to Auguste Édouard Manet, an official at the Ministry of Justice, and Eugénie Désirée Manet. Manet's father, who had expected his son to study law, vigorously opposed his wish to become a painter. The career of naval officer was decided upon as a compromise, and at the age of 16 Édouard sailed to Rio de Janeiro on a training vessel. Upon his return he failed to pass the entrance examination of the naval academy. His father relented, and in 1850 Manet entered the studio of Thomas Couture, where, in spite of many disagreements with his teacher, he remained until 1856. During this period, Manet traveled abroad and made numerous copies after the Old Masters in both foreign and French public collections. 
Early Works
Manet's entry for the Salon of 1859, The Absinthe Drinker, a thematically romantic but conceptually daring work, was rejected. At the Salon of 1861, his Spanish Singer, one of a number of works of Spanish character painted in this period, not only was admitted to the Salon but won an honorable mention and the acclaim of the poet Théophile Gautier. This was to be Manet's last success for many years. 

[[File:Edouard Manet 024.jpg|Edouard Manet 024|thumb|Le déjeuner sur l'herbe by Manet (1863)]]
 
In 1863, Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, a Dutch pianist. That year he showed 14 paintings at the Martinet Gallery; one of them, Music in the Tuileries, remarkable for its freshness in the handling of a contemporary scene, was greeted with considerable hostility. Also in 1863, the Salon rejected Manet's large painting Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe, or Luncheon on the Grass, and the artist elected to have it shown at the now famous Salon des Refusés, created by the emperor under the pressure of the exceptionally large number of painters whose work had been turned away. Here, Manet's picture attracted the most attention and brought forth a kind of abusive criticism that was to set a pattern for years to come. 

In 1865, Manet's Olympia produced a still more violent reaction at the official Salon, and his reputation as a renegade became widespread. Upset by the criticism, Manet made a brief trip to Spain, where he admired many works by Diego Velázquez, to whom he referred as &quot;the painter of painters.&quot; 

===Support of Baudelaire and Zola===
Manet's close friend and supporter during the early years was Charles Baudelaire, who, in 1862, had written a quatrain to accompany one of Manet's Spanish subjects, Lola de Valence, and the public, largely as a result of the strange atmosphere of the Olympia, linked the two men readily. In 1866, after the Salon jury had rejected two of Manet's works, Émile Zola came to his defense with a series of articles filled with strongly expressed, uncompromising praise. In 1867, he published a book that contains the prediction, &quot;Manet's place is destined to be in the Louvre.&quot; This book appears on Zola's desk in Manet's portrait of the writer (1868). In May of that year, the Paris World's Fair opened its doors, and Manet, at his own expense, exhibited 50 of his works in a temporary structure, not far from Gustave Courbet's private exhibition. This was in keeping with Manet's view, expressed years later to his friend Antonin Proust, that his paintings must be seen together in order to be fully understood. 
 
Although Manet insisted that a painter be &quot;resolutely of his own time&quot; and that he paint what he sees, he nevertheless produced two important religious works, Dead Christ with Angels and Christ Mocked by the Soldiers, which were shown at the Salons of 1864 and 1865, respectively, and ridiculed. Only Zola could defend the former work on the grounds of its vigorous realism while playing down its alleged lack of piety. It is also true that although Manet despised the academic category of &quot;history painting&quot; he did paint the contemporary Naval Battle between the Kearsarge and the Alabama (1864) and The Execution of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (1867). The latter is based upon a careful gathering of the facts surrounding the incident and composed, largely, after Francisco Goya's Executions of the Third of May, resulting in a curious amalgam of the particular and the universal. Manet's use of older works of art in elaborating his own major compositions has long been, and continues to be, a problematic subject, since the old view that this procedure was needed to compensate for the artist's own inadequate imagination is rapidly being discarded.

===Late Works===
Although Manet influenced the Impressionists during the 1860s, during the next decade it appears that it was he who learned from them. His palette became lighter; his stroke, without ever achieving the analytical intensity of Claude Monet's, was shorter and more rapid. Nevertheless, Manet never cultivated plein-airism seriously, and he remained essentially a figure and studio painter. Also, despite his sympathy for most of the Impressionists with whom the public associated him, he never exhibited with them at their series of private exhibitions, which began in 1874. He was particularly close to the female Impressionist Berthe Morisot, whom he met in 1868. Manet was a great influence on Morisot, and she in turn helped him accept some of the tenets of Impressionism to greater effect in his work; she also posed for him numerous times, notably for The Balcony (1869) and Repose (c. 1870). In 1874, Morisot married Manet's younger brother, Eugéne, also a painter. 
Manet had his first resounding success since The Spanish Singer at the Salon of 1873 with his Bon Bock, which radiates a touch and joviality of expression reminiscent of Frans Hals, in contrast to Manet's usually austere figures. In spite of the popularity of this painting, his success was not to extend to the following season. About this time he met the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, with whom he remained on intimate terms for the remainder of his life. After Manet's rejection by the jury in 1876, Mallarmé took up his defense. 

[[File:Edouard Manet 004.jpg|thumb|Edouard Manet 004|thumb|right|Le Bar des Folies-Bergère by Manet (1881-1882)]]
 
Toward the end of the 1870s, although Manet retained the bright palette and the touch of his Impressionist works, he returned to the figure problems of the early years. The undeniable sense of mystery is found again in several bar scenes, notably the Brasserie Reichshoffen, in which the relationships of the figures recall those of Luncheon on the Grass. Perhaps the apotheosis of his lifelong endeavors is to be found in his last major work, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (1881-1882). Here, in the expression of the barmaid, is all the starkness of the great confrontations of the 1860s, but bathed in a profusion of colors. While we are drawn to the brilliantly painted accessories, it is the girl, placed at the center before a mirror, which dominates the composition and ultimately demands our attention. Although her reflected image, showing her to be in conversation with a man, is absorbed into the brilliant atmosphere of the setting, she remains enigmatic and aloof. Manet produced two aspects of the same personality, combined the fleeting with the eternal, and, by &quot;misplacing&quot; the reflected image, took a step toward abstraction as a solution to certain lifelong philosophical and technical problems. 
In 1881, Manet was finally admitted to membership in the Legion of Honor, an award he had long coveted. By then he was seriously ill. Therapy at the sanatorium at Bellevue failed to improve his health, and walking became increasingly difficult for him. In his weakened condition he found it easier to handle pastels than oils, and he produced a great many flower pieces and portraits in that medium. In the spring of 1883, his left leg was amputated, but this did not prolong his life. He died peacefully in Paris on April 30. 
Manet was short, unusually handsome, and witty. His biographers stress his kindness and unaffected generosity toward his friends. The paradoxical elements in his art are an extension of the man: although a revolutionary in art, he craved official honors; while fashionably dressed, he affected a Parisian slang at odds with his appearance and impeccable manners; and although he espoused the style of life of the conservative classes, his political sentiments were those of the republican liberal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sometimes, the built in string functions are not the most convenient or elegant solution to the problem at hand. If the task involves manipulating complicated patterns of characters, ''regular expressions'' can be a more effective tool than sequences of simple string functions.

Visual Basic has no built-in support for regular expressions. It can use regular expressions via VBScript Regular Expression Library, though. If you have Internet Explorer installed, you almost certainly have the library. To use it, you must add a reference to the project; on the ''Project'' menu choose ''References'' and scroll down to ''Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions''. There might be more than one version; if so, choose the one with the highest version number, unless you have some particular reason to choose an old version, such as compatibility with that version on another machine.

==Class outline==
Class outline of VBScript.RegExp class:

==Constructing a regexp==

A method of constructing a regular expression object:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

A method of constructing a regular expression object that requires that, in Excel, you set a reference to Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = new RegExp
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Testing for match==

An example of testing for match of a regular expression
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set RegExp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   RegExp.Pattern = &quot;[0-9][0-9]*&quot;
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 1 passed.&quot;
   End If
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;a354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 2 passed.&quot; 'This one passes, as the matching is not a whole-string one
   End If
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;abc&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 3 passed.&quot; 'This one does not pass
   End If
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of testing for match in which the whole string has to match:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set RegExp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   RegExp.Pattern = &quot;^[0-9][0-9]*$&quot;
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 1 passed.&quot;
   End If
   If RegExp.Test(&quot;a354647&quot;) Then
     MsgBox &quot;Test 2 passed.&quot; 'This one does not pass
   End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finding matches==
An example of iterating through the collection of all the matches of a regular expression in a string:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;a.*?z&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True 'Without global, only the first match is found
   Set Matches = Regex.Execute(&quot;aaz abz acz ad1z&quot;)
   For Each Match In Matches
     MsgBox &quot;A match: &quot; &amp; Match
   Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finding groups==
An example of accessing matched groups:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;(a*) *(b*)&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True
   Set Matches = Regexp.Execute(&quot;aaa bbb&quot;)
   For Each Match In Matches
     FirstGroup = Match.SubMatches(0) '=aaa
     SecondGroup = Match.SubMatches(1) '=bbb
   Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Replacing==

An example of replacing all sequences of dashes with a single dash:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;--*&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True
   Result = Regexp.Replace(&quot;A-B--C----D&quot;, &quot;-&quot;) '=&quot;A-B-C-D&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of replacing doubled strings with their single version with the use of two sorts of ''backreference'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
   Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
   Regexp.Pattern = &quot;(.*)\1&quot;
   Regexp.Global = True
   Result = Regexp.Replace(&quot;hellohello&quot;, &quot;$1&quot;) '=&quot;hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Splitting==
There is no direct support for splitting by a regular expression, but there is a workaround. If you can assume that the split string does not contain Chr(1), you can first replace the separator regular expression with Chr(1), and then use the non-regexp split function on Chr(1).

An example of splitting by a non-zero number of spaces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  SplitString = &quot;a b  c   d&quot;
  Set Regexp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
  Regexp.Pattern = &quot;  *&quot;
  Regexp.Global = True
  Result = Regexp.Replace(SplitString , Chr(1))
  SplitArray = Split(Result, Chr(1))
  For Each Element In SplitArray
    MsgBox Element 
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example application==

For many beginning programmers, the ideas behind regular expressions are so foreign that it might be worth presenting a simple example before discussing the theory. The example given is in fact the beginning of an application for scraping web pages to retrieve source code so it is relevant too.

Imagine that you need to parse a web page to pick up the major headings and the content to which the headings refer.  Such a web page might look like this:

[[Image:Visual Basic Classic RegExp Example Web Page.png|frame]]

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;RegEx Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;RegEx Example&lt;/h1&gt;
        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        &lt;h2&gt;Level Two in RegEx Example&lt;/h2&gt;
          bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
      &lt;h1&gt;Level One&lt;/h1&gt;
        cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
        &lt;h2&gt;Level Two in Level One&lt;/h2&gt;
          dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

What we want to do is extract the text in the two ''h1 elements'' and all the text between the first ''h1'' and the second ''h1'' as well as all the text between the second ''h1 element'' and the end of body tag.

We could store the results in an array that looks like this:

{|
|-
|&quot;RegEx Example&quot;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;      aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n&lt;h2&gt;Level Two in RegEx Example&lt;/h2&gt;\nbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
|-
|&quot;Level One&quot;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;     cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\n&lt;h2&gt;Level Two in Level One&lt;/h2&gt;\n
          dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|}

The ''\n'' character sequences represent end of line marks.  These could be any of ''carriage return'', ''line feed'' or ''carriage return'' followed by ''line feed''.

A regular expression specifies patterns of characters to be matched and the result of the matching process is a list of sub-strings that match either the whole expression or some parts of the expression.  An expression that does what we want might look like this:
  &lt;nowiki&gt;
  &quot;&lt;h1&gt;\s*([\s\S]*?)\s*&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
  &lt;/nowiki&gt;
Actually it doesn't quite do it but it is close.  The result is a collection of matches in an object of type ''MatchCollection'':
  &lt;nowiki&gt;
  Item 0
    .FirstIndex:89
    .Length:24
    .Value:&quot;&lt;h1&gt;RegEx Example&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
    .SubMatches:
      .Count:1
      Item 0
        &quot;RegEx Example&quot;
  Item 1
    .FirstIndex:265
    .Length:20
    .Value:&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Level One&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
    .SubMatches:
      .Count:1
      Item 0
        &quot;Level One&quot;
  &lt;/nowiki&gt;
The name of the item is in the ''SubMatches'' of each item but where is the text?  To get that we can simply use ''Mid$'' together with the ''FirstIndex'' and ''Length'' properties of each match to find the start and finish of the text between the end of one ''h1'' and the start of the next.  However, as usual there is a problem.  The last match is not terminated by another ''h1'' element but by the end of ''body'' tag.  So our last match will include that tag and all the stuff that can follow the body.  The solution is to use another expression to get just the body first:

  &quot;&lt;body&gt;([\s\S]*)&lt;/body&gt;&quot;

This returns just one match with on sub-match and the sub match is everything between the body and end body tags.  Now we can use our original expression on this new string and it should work.

Now that you have seen an example here is a detailed description of the expressions used and the property settings of the Regular Expression object used.

A regular expression is simply a string of characters but some characters have special meanings.  In this expression:

  &quot;&lt;body&gt;([\s\S]*)&lt;/body&gt;&quot;

there are three principal parts:

  &quot;&lt;body&gt;&quot;
  &quot;([\s\S]*)&quot;
  &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&quot;

Each of these parts is also a regular expression.  The first and last are simple strings with no meaning beyond the identity of the characters, they will match any string that includes them as a substring.  

The middle expression is rather more obscure.  It matches absolutely any sequence of characters and also captures what it matches.  Capturing is indicated by surrounding the expression with round brackets.  The text that is captured is returned as one of the ''SubMatches'' of a match.

{|
|-
|&lt;body&gt;||matches just &lt;body&gt;
|-
|(||begins a capture expression
|-
|[||begins a character class
|-
|\s||specifies the character class that includes all white space characters
|-
|\S||specifies the character class that includes all non-white space characters
|-
|]||ends the character class
|-
|*||means that as many instances of the preceding expression as possible are to be matched
|-
|)||ends the capture expression
|-
|&lt;/body&gt;||matches &lt;/body&gt;
|}

In the case studies section of this book there is a simple application that you can use to test regular expressions: [[../Regular Expression Tester|Regular Expression Tester]].

Hello Kmarinas86, welcome to Wikibooks! I suggest that you go read [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and learn what this project is about. Then you can [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|become a contributor]].

I noticed that your first contribution, [[Cyclic Multiverse Theory]], is now on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. It seems that it had [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cyclic Multiverse Theory|faced deletion on Wikipedia]], and some Wikipedia users had unfortunately suggested moving the page to Wikibooks. We have [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works|rules against original research]], which is what your contribution seems to be.

There is almost certainly some wiki that can take original-research contributions. I wonder if [[wikinfo:Main Page|Wikinfo]] would take it. They are similar to Wikipedia, but have [[wikinfo:Wikinfo:About/Comparisons to Wikipedia|several significant differences]]. I do not contribute to Wikinfo (though I read it sometimes) so I am not immediately sure if it is an appropriate place. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:29, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual Basic has a traditional set of built in string operations.  Unlike many languages Visual Basic strings are always [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] so they can hold any character.  They are also always dynamically allocated and are of almost unlimited length (theoretically up to about 2^31 characters, about 2000 million). 

Note that Unicode uses more than one byte to represent each character.  As far as VB is concerned Unicode characters are two bytes which gives 2^16 or 65536 possible values.  This is enough even for Chinese, Japanase and Korean character sets (''CJK'').  In fact Unicode defines 17 planes each of which has room for 2^16 code points but VB (and Windows) uses only the [[w:Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]] (''BMP'').

See [http://web.archive.org/web/20080626021549/http://www.romanpress.com/Articles/Strings_R/Strings.htm What Are VB Strings?] for a concise explanation of the internal workings of Visual Basic Classic strings.

==[[../Built In String Functions|Built In String Functions]]==
Visual Basic provides a reasonable set of traditional functions for manipulating and searching strings.  These functions are usually all that is needed for most programs that are not primarily concerned with text processing.  

==[[../Regular Expressions|Regular Expressions]]==
A regular expression is a character string in which some characters have special meanings.  Such a string can be used to search for substrings in another string in much more sophisticated ways than the built in InStr function.

For example this expression:

  &quot;(dog|cat)&quot;

will match either 'dog' or 'cat'.

Visual Basic has no built in regular expression functions, but these are available in the VBScript regular expression library.  If your program does a lot of text processing ''regular expressions'' are definitely worth learning even though they may seem intimidating at the start.  In practice most programmers find that the more arcane expressions are rarely used and the same idioms are recycled over and over so there is really not as much to learn as it at first appears.

Fireman's carry: Begin by tying up with inside control. Next you will need to do a draw-in step (take a step backwards to draw the opponent in to you). As they step in towards you, drop to your left knee while holding on to the inside control with your left hand(DO NOT LET GO). Take your right arm and wrap it around the opponents right leg. Drop your left shoulder to the mat and sit through to a headlock.

Lots of this stuff made it into the 1999 C standard or is available via the optimizer. The standard C way to do a rotation is to use shifting, masking, and oring. A good compiler, like gcc, will use a rotate instruction for this. Variable length array stuff is in the 1999 standard. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:54, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

: Yes. Should we spell out exactly how to do that here, or just link to other sections of this book for more details? [[C Programming/Further math#shift and rotate]] discusses the rotate instruction. [[Talk:C Programming/Weaknesses of C]] briefly mentions the &quot;variable length array&quot; syntax and the &quot;flexible array member&quot; syntax. Where in this book is the right place to fully explain how to use them? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:44, 3 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

----
Tight waist tilt-get a tight waist and drive your opponent at a 11 o'clock angle(if you have the tight waist in your right hand)while driving pull the waist and secure an arm with your other arm and get into a tight near fall position.not good for pinning but great for getting quick easy points 

'''Riding Legs'''

''The key to riding legs is constantly repositioning your hips!''
When you ride legs, or &quot;throw legs in&quot; you need to have excellent balance.
This will be explained starting from referees position, on the left side.

1- Take your left leg and kick it between your opponents left arm and left leg, then rap it around his left leg. 

2-Using your Right Leg, do what is called a &quot;Dig Shin.&quot; where you put your foot under your opponents shin and raise itup to keep your opponent off balance. It also acts like an emergency brake if you get thrown.

3- ALWAYS GRAB HOLD OF SOMETHING WHEN RIDING LEGS! GRAB HIS ARM OR LEG, THROW IN A HALF, ANYTHING!

Now there are a couple moves you can work from here...

*Guillotine
One of the best/hardest moves in wrestling. With your left leg in, use your left arm to hook his right arm. Then grab his right wrist with your right hand. Lift the arm just high enough to where you can duck your head under it, and pop it up on the other side of the arm. Release his arm with your left arm but stay on th wrist with your right. Arch back SLOWLY, while SLOWLY reaching your left arm towards his head. Once you have his head and he is on his back, let go of his wrist and connect both hands around his head. Pull his head toward you and arch into him with your hips, HARD. Stand by for the win.

*Banana Split
A less complicated move than the guillotine. With the left leg in, reach your left arm to the inside of his right leg. Connect your right hand behind the leg with your left. Then arch backwards and roll him onto his back. Arch into him as hard as possible. 

*Inverted Spladle
This move is dangerous in the higher weights, so let the little guys stick to this one (103-140)
With the left leg in, reach with your RIGHT arm inside of the right leg. Connect with your left hand in FRONT of the right leg. Roll to his back. If you lock this up correctly, and hang on tight, there is practically no way to lose, unless you are losing by 4 points and you run out of time for the pin.

*Power Half
This is a pretty basic move. all you have to do is get both of your legs in  then get in a half and hook it up with your other hand then begin powering them over. 
  
*Helicopter
This is a simple move where you throw the leg that is not hooked to the other side of the opponents body like your leg is the arm of a helicopter then when the opponent falls to his hip cross face him to the mat.(swing your leg as hard as possible)

[[Image:Artocarpus heterophyllus fruits at tree.jpg|thumb|Jackfruit]]

The '''jackfruit''' is a very large fruit from trees native to south-western [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]. Jackfruit can be up to 90cm long, 50cm in diameter, and weight up to 36kg. The taste is similar to that of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], but milder and less juicy. It is popular throughout [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]] and [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-east Asia]].

Jackfruit can be eaten as a fresh fruit, both ripe and unripe. It is also often combined into cooked meals, both sweet and savoury. Jackfruit can be bought in cans, and as dried pieces. 

{{Wikipedia|Jackfruit}}
[[Category:Jackfruit recipes|*]]


===Young fruit===
The young fruit is called ''Polos'' in Sri Lanka. It is a dish with spices to replace meat curries in Sri Lankan cuisine. The skin of unripe (young) jack fruit must be pared first and discarded and then the whole fruit can be chopped into edible portions and cooked to be eaten. The raw young fruit is not edible. Young jackfruit has a mild flavour and distinctive poultry like texture. The cuisines of India,Nepal,Bangladesh,Sri Lanka,Indonesia,Cambodia, and Vietnam use cooked young jackfruit. In Indonesia, young jackfruit is eaten as gudeg. In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food.
[[Image:Jackfruit chips.jpg|thumb||upright|Jackfruit chips]]


===Ripe fruit===
Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet with subtle flavouring. It can be used to make a variety of dishes including custards, cakes, halo-halo and more. Ripe jackruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried and sold as jackfruit chips.

== Move this book ==

Shouldnt this book be moved to [[Google_Services_And_Products/Gmail]] , its more organized --[[User:Ncusa367|Ncusa367]] ([[User talk:Ncusa367|talk]]) 18:11, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

: I have to respectfully disagree with your oppinion that the single page at [[Google_Services_And_Products/Gmail]] is more organised than [[Gmail]]. I suggest that we merge the content to this book and link here. We could place this book under [[Google_Services_And_Products]] but, frankly, I don't see the need for it.
: An argument could be made to place it under a book on free email services. Since there are multiple ways of categorising it, but it doesn't depend on any other modules, I think it's better to keep things seperate and link books on related topics. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:42, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

== Delete the old name convention redirects ==

The argument against is that there is no real need and one shouldn't delete pages that might have links pointing to them from outside Wikibooks. The argument for is that deleting these helps clear up the [[Special:AllPages]] indices and this wikibook is hardly such a big player that anyone will have links dating back a couple of years to the pages here. Anyone against? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:06, 12 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Native American cuisine|Native American Cuisine]]

This is a traditional [[Cookbook:Native American cuisine|Native American]] [[cookbook:flatbread|flatbread]] usually made on an open fire or a [[Cookbook:Barbecue|barbecue]], or fried in a pan of hot oil over a stove top. This recipe uses modern techniques and tools.

Fry bread is best served hot, topped with melted margarine, [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or agave nectar, berry [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], or [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]].

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tsp|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] (alternatively and for a healthier end product, you can substitute either 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of plain yogurt, or a 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of soured milk as a leavening agent instead of baking powder, but add 2 hours to the rest time for the dough, and the dough must be left somewhere warm.  You can include the baking powder as well to get a very puffy version of frybread as an optional ingredient) 
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] (alternatively, you can use mayonaise in place of shortening for a crispy, crunchier texture)
* 2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] hot water (if using yogurt or soured milk for leavening, use a 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of water instead)

==Procedure==
# Mix flour, baking powder (or yogurt or soured milk) and salt in a bowl.
# Use a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] (or two butter knives) to cut the shortening  (or mayonaise) into the flour.
# Add the hot water and mix until the water is incorporated.
# Turn out the dough on a lightly floured board.
# Knead the dough until it is soft and smooth.
# Wrap the dough in plastic and let the dough rest for 30 minutes (if using yogurt or soured milk as a leavening agent, let the dough rest for 2 hours).
# Divide the dough into 6 pieces, roll each into a ball, and roll into flat disks with a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]].
# Brush one side of each disk with melted margarine and place on a barbecue over a [[Cookbook:Barbecuing#.22Mississippi.22_Method|3 Mississippi]] fire (you can also fry the dough in hot oil over a stovetop.  The dough cooks rapidly and will brown in about 12 seconds and must be turned over to allow the opposite side to brown, then be removed from the oil and placed sideways into a colander or large bowl lined with paper towels to allow the oil to drain off the finished product).
# Brush the opposing side of the bread with margarine and flip the bread on the barbecue.
# Cook until both sides are golden brown. Serve hot.
