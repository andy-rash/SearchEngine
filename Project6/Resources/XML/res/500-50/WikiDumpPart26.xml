'''Chapter 3'''

==verses 1-4 (done)==
1 Now there was one of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus&amp;#8722;a ruler among the Judeans.
 
2 He came to Jesus &lt;s&gt;by&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;at&lt;/B&gt; night and said, &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can &lt;s&gt;do&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;perform&lt;/B&gt; these signs &lt;s&gt;which&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;as&lt;/B&gt; you &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;have been&lt;/B&gt; doing, unless God is with him.

3 &quot;In all truthfulness, I tell you,&quot; answered Jesus, &quot;that unless a &lt;s&gt;man&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;person&lt;/B&gt; is born &lt;s&gt;anew&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;again&lt;/B&gt; he (&lt;B&gt;or she&lt;/B&gt;) cannot see the Kingdom of God.&quot;  

4 &quot;How is it possible,&quot; Nicodemus asked, &quot;for a man to be born when he is old? Can he &lt;s&gt;a second time&lt;/s&gt; enter his mother's womb &lt;B&gt;the second time&lt;/B&gt; and be born &lt;B&gt;again&lt;/B&gt;?&quot; 
==verses 5-8 (done)==
5 &quot;Again, truthfully I tell you,&quot; replied Jesus, &quot;that unless a &lt;s&gt;man&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;person&lt;/B&gt; is born of water and the Spirit, he (&lt;B&gt;or she&lt;/B&gt;) cannot enter the Kingdom of God. 

6 Whatever is born of &lt;s&gt;the flesh&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;woman&lt;/B&gt; is &lt;s&gt;flesh&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;of the body&lt;/B&gt;, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit. 

7 Do not be astonished at my telling you, `You must all be born &lt;s&gt;anew&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;again&lt;/B&gt;.' 

8 The wind blows &lt;s&gt;where&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;wherever&lt;/B&gt; it chooses; &lt;s&gt;and&lt;/s&gt; you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. &lt;s&gt;So is it with&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;And&lt;/B&gt; in the same way&lt;/B&gt; everyone who has been born of the Spirit &lt;B&gt;is moved by the Spirit&lt;/B&gt;.&quot;  
==verses 9-12 (done)==
9 &quot;&lt;B&gt;Still&lt;/B&gt;, how is all this possible?&quot; asked Nicodemus. 

10 &lt;s&gt;Are you,&quot; replied Jesus&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Jesus answered, saying, &quot;Are you&lt;/B&gt; `’the Teacher of Israel,' and yet &lt;s&gt;do&lt;/s&gt; you &lt;B&gt;do&lt;/B&gt; not understand these &lt;s&gt;things&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;principles&lt;/B&gt;? 

11 In all truthfulness, I tell you that we speak what we know, and give evidence concerning what we have witnessed, and yet, &lt;s&gt;you&lt;/s&gt; all &lt;B&gt;of you&lt;/B&gt; reject our testimony. 

12 If I have told you of &lt;B&gt;such&lt;/B&gt; things on earth and none of you &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; me, how will you &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; me if I tell you of &lt;B&gt;heavenly&lt;/B&gt; things &lt;s&gt;in heaven&lt;/s&gt;?

==verses 13-16 (done)==
13 There is no one who has gone up to Heaven, except One who has come down from Heaven, namely the Son of Man whose home is &lt;s&gt;in&lt;/s&gt; heaven &lt;B&gt;itself&lt;/B&gt;. 

14 &lt;B&gt;For even&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;And just&lt;/s&gt; as Moses lifted &lt;s&gt;high&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;up&lt;/B&gt; the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be &lt;s&gt;lifted up&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;elevated&lt;/B&gt;, 

15 in order that every&lt;B&gt;one&lt;/B&gt; who &lt;U&gt;believes&lt;/U&gt; in Him may have eternal Life.&quot; 

16 For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only born Son, that every&lt;B&gt;one&lt;/B&gt; who &lt;U&gt;believes&lt;/U&gt; in Him should not &lt;s&gt;perish&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;s&gt;experience&lt;/s&gt; be subject to death&lt;/B&gt; but have eternal Life.
==verses 17-20 (done)==
17 &lt;B&gt;For&lt;/B&gt; God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. 

18 &lt;s&gt;He who believes in Him does not come up for judgement&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Believers&lt;/U&gt; in Him do not come under condemnation&lt;/B&gt;: &lt;s&gt;He who does not believe has&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;while those who do not &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; have&lt;/B&gt; already received &lt;B&gt;their&lt;/B&gt; sentence, because &lt;s&gt;he has not believed&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;of lack of &lt;U&gt;belief&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt; in the &lt;s&gt;name&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;person&lt;/B&gt; of God's only Son.

19 &lt;s&gt;And&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Then&lt;/B&gt; this is the &lt;s&gt;test by which men are judged&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;judgment process&lt;/B&gt; &amp;#8722; &lt;B&gt;that&lt;/B&gt; the Light has come into the world, and &lt;s&gt;men&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;people&lt;/B&gt; have loved the darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds have been &lt;s&gt;wicked&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;evil&lt;/B&gt;.

20 For every wrongdoer hates the &lt;B&gt;L&lt;/B&gt;ight, and does not come into &lt;s&gt;it&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;the Light&lt;/B&gt;, for fear his/&lt;B&gt;her&lt;/B&gt; actions should be exposed.
==verses 21-24 (done)==
21 But &lt;B&gt;the one&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;he&lt;/s&gt; whose actions are true comes into the light, that his/&lt;B&gt;her&lt;/B&gt; actions may be plainly shown to have been done &lt;B&gt;through&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;in&lt;/s&gt; God.

22 After this, Jesus and His disciples went &lt;B&gt;in&lt;/B&gt;to &lt;B&gt;the&lt;/B&gt; Judea&lt;B&gt;n countryside&lt;/B&gt;; and there He &lt;B&gt;remained&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;stayed in company&lt;/s&gt; with them and baptized.

23 And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were many pools &lt;B&gt;of water&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;and streams&lt;/s&gt;  there; and &lt;B&gt;a long procession of&lt;/B&gt; people came and received baptism.

24 (For John &lt;B&gt;the Baptist&lt;/B&gt; &lt;B&gt;had&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;was&lt;/s&gt; not yet &lt;B&gt;been&lt;/B&gt; thrown into prison.)

==verses 25-30 (done)==
25 &lt;s&gt;So&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;At that time&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;s&gt;a discussion having arisen on the part of&lt;/s&gt; John's disciples &lt;B&gt;had a serious discussion&lt;/B&gt; with a &lt;s&gt;Jew&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Judean partisan&lt;/B&gt; about purification,
 
26 &lt;B&gt;and&lt;/B&gt; they came to John &lt;s&gt;and reported to him&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;with the report&lt;/B&gt;, &quot;Rabbi, &lt;s&gt;he&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;the one&lt;/B&gt; who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, &lt;s&gt;and to&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;about&lt;/B&gt; whom you bore testimony is now baptizing, and &lt;s&gt;great numbers of&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;many&lt;/B&gt; people are &lt;s&gt;resorting&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;turning&lt;/B&gt; to him.&quot;

27 &quot;A man cannot &lt;s&gt;obtain&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;gain&lt;/B&gt; anything,&quot; replied John, &quot;unless it has been &lt;s&gt;granted to&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;given him&lt;/B&gt; from Heaven.

28 You &lt;s&gt;yourselves can bear witness to my having&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;were there when I&lt;/B&gt; said, `I am not the Christ,' but, `I am His &lt;s&gt;appointed&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;acknowledged&lt;/B&gt; forerunner.'

29 He who &lt;s&gt;has&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;is with&lt;/B&gt; the bride is the bridegroom; &lt;s&gt;and&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;even so,&lt;/B&gt; the bridegroom's friend who stands &lt;B&gt;expectantly&lt;/B&gt; by his side &lt;s&gt;and listens to him&lt;/s&gt;, rejoices &lt;s&gt;heartily&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;greatly&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;on&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;upon&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;account of&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;hearing&lt;/B&gt; the bridegroom's voice. &lt;s&gt;This is&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;In this&lt;/B&gt; my joy &lt;B&gt;is&lt;/B&gt; now complete.
 
30 &lt;s&gt;He must grow greater&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;His work must increase&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;s&gt;but I must grow less&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;and mine must decrease&lt;/B&gt;.

==verses 31-36 (done)==
31 He who comes from above is above &lt;s&gt;all&lt;/s&gt;. He who &lt;s&gt;springs&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;comes&lt;/B&gt; from the earth not only springs from the earth, but speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
 
32 What He has seen and heard, to that He &lt;s&gt;bears witness&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;gives testimony&lt;/B&gt;; but His evidence no one accepts.

33 &lt;s&gt;Any&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;All&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;man&lt;/s&gt; who &lt;s&gt;has&lt;/s&gt; accept&lt;s&gt;ed&lt;/s&gt; His testimony &lt;s&gt;has&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;have&lt;/B&gt; &lt;s&gt;solemnly declared&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;set their seal on the declaration&lt;/B&gt; that God is true.

34 &lt;s&gt;For&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;He is the One&lt;/B&gt; whom God has sent &lt;B&gt;and&lt;/B&gt; speaks God's words; &lt;B&gt;for&lt;/B&gt; God does not give the Spirit in &lt;s&gt;sparing&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;small&lt;/B&gt; measure.&quot;

35 The Father loves the Son and has &lt;s&gt;entrusted&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;placed&lt;/B&gt; everything &lt;B&gt;in&lt;/B&gt;&lt;s&gt;to&lt;/s&gt; His hands.

36 &lt;s&gt;He&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;Those&lt;/B&gt; who &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; in the Son &lt;s&gt;has&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;have&lt;/B&gt; eternal Life; &lt;s&gt;he&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;those&lt;/B&gt; who do&lt;s&gt;es&lt;/s&gt; not &lt;U&gt;believe&lt;/U&gt; the Son will not &lt;s&gt;see&lt;/s&gt; &lt;B&gt;experience that&lt;/B&gt; Life, but &lt;B&gt;bear the brunt of&lt;/B&gt; God's anger &lt;s&gt;remains upon him&lt;/s&gt;.

|2 He came to Jesus at night and said, &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can perform these signs as you have been doing, unless God is with him.
|&lt;small&gt;Teaching: accredited by God&lt;/small&gt;

|4 &quot;How is it possible,&quot; Nicodemus asked, &quot;for a man to be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb the second time and be born again?&quot;
|&lt;small&gt;Proselytize a Judean&lt;br&gt;official: unheard of&lt;/small&gt;

|3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born ''of water'' and of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

|5 &quot;Again, truthfully I tell you,&quot; replied Jesus, &quot;that unless a person is born of water and the Spirit, he (or she) cannot enter the Kingdom of God.

|3:8 The wind (o. pneuma) blows where it decides, and you hear the ''sound'' thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. (o. pneuma)
|sound&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;phi;&amp;omega;&amp;nu;&amp;eta;&amp;nu;&lt;/B&gt; (5456)
|8 The wind blows wherever it chooses; you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. And in the same way everyone who has been born of the Spirit is moved by the Spirit.&quot;

|3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; ''but that'' the world through him ''might be saved''.

|3:18 He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not ''is condemned already'', because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

|3:20 For every one that does evil hates the light, ''neither comes to the light'', lest his deeds should be reproved.

|20 For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come into the Light, for fear his (or her) actions should be exposed.
|&lt;small&gt;Actions speak louder:&lt;br&gt;conviction or convicted.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|3:21 But he that ''does truth'' comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

|3:22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the ''land of Judaea''; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

There's a [[wikipedia:boat|boat]] floating in a [[wikipedia:swimming pool|pool]]. First, you place the (large) ball of lead in the boat, and measure the water's level. Then, you take the ball out and drop it into the pool, and measure the water's level again. Assuming the boat doesn't sink from the lead ball being in it, ''during which measurement will the water's level be higher''?

The water's level will be higher when the ball is in the boat. 

When the ball is in the boat, it displaces the volume of water that weighs the same as the ball (see [[wikipedia:buoyancy | buoyancy]]). When the ball is in the water, it only displaces as much water as its volume.

For example, assume the ball's volume is 1.000 cubic metre. Then its mass is 11340 kg, and when placed in the boat it displaces 11340kg of water, which is the same as 11.340 cubic metres. When the ball is in the water, it onl displaces its own volume, which equals 1.000 cubic metre.

More water is displaced when the ball is in the boat, and so the water level rises more, leading to our result.

This simple tutorial shows how you can use IC Send module to control any desired parameter of your favourite instrument with a cool sequencer from another instrument. You just need to understand how to browse through Reaktor structure.

'''The idea of this tutorial was created on Reaktor User Forum. [http://www.nativeinstruments.de/forum_us/showthread.php?t=26329 See the whole story].'''

In addition you can download a demonstration ensemble from the [http://www.nativeinstruments.de/site/index.php?id=userlibrary_us&amp;type=0&amp;ulbr=1&amp;plview=detail&amp;patchid=3388 User Library].

==Use IC Send to send gate (rhythm) signal==
# First, you have to find the sequencer in Massive. Normally, you would right-click on the sequencer in panel and choose '''Show in structure''', but Massive uses Mouse Area, which detects mouse-clicks, and therefore the right button doesn't work. But it's not difficult to find the sequencer in the structure: open '''Massive''' and go down into the structure:
#*Massive
#*Drums
#*Drum1 (Kick/snare)
#*Proto1
# Insert '''IC Send module''' (Build-In Module, Terminal, IC Send) and wire it to '''G1''' terminal of &quot;'''Macro'''&quot; macro:&lt;br&gt;[[Image:1 proto 1.gif]]
# Look at the '''Massive panel'''. You may need to move the visible IC Send module to a desired position:&lt;br&gt;[[Image:2 massive panel with ic send.gif]]
# Insert new '''instrument''' into the ensemble - a desired drum synthesizer or sampler (sampler doesn't really make sense, because Massive is a sampler!). In this tutorial, we will use HiHat synthesizer from DSQ-32.ens.
# Connect the sound output of '''HiHat''' to '''Audio Out''' (your sound card) in the highest level of Reaktor structure.
# Go inside of '''HiHat''' Instrument and find '''Gate''' input terminal.
# Insert '''IC Receive''' (Buil-In Module, Termina, IC Receive) and wire it to input HiHat macro:&lt;br&gt;[[Image:3 gate replace.gif]]
# From the '''Massive''' panel, open the menu of '''IC Send''' module and select HiHat &gt; IC Receive:&lt;br&gt;[[Image:4 ic send to ic receive.gif]]&lt;br&gt;This way you create a wireless connection between the sequencer in Massive and Gate input of HiHat instrument. Please note, that this connection works between two instruments! That's a very fast and creative feature! Without doing much cables etc, you can quickly connect any sequencer to your favourite instrument.
# Have fun!

==Modulate a knob with Massive modulation track==
The idea here is to automate a knob with sequencer from Massive. It means, that the knob will automatically turn or jump, along with a sequence you can co compose. This can be very cool, it will add life to the &quot;flat&quot; sound of your instrument. Using this method you can automate any knob, or many knobs at the same time. Can you turn 10 knobs at the same time? With this method you can! Note that for this use, it’s not necessary to add an additional IC Receive module anywhere in the target instrument, even if you haven’t added one before; the Send module will automatically see all the available parameters on its own; pretty cool!
# Open Massive structure and go to macro '''Aux. MOD seq 12-13-14-''', '''Stacked Macro'''. That's the modulation sequencer of Massive.
# Insert '''Out Port''' (Build-In Module, Terminal, Out Port)
# Rename the '''Out Port''' to '''G''' and wire it to G output of '''MOD SEQ id 12''' macro:&lt;br&gt;[[Image:5 mod seq id 12.gif]]
# Go one level higher, insert '''IC Send''' module (Build-In Module, Terminal, IC Send) and wire it '''G''' output of the '''Stacked Macro''':&lt;br&gt;[[Image:6 ic send from stacked.gif]]. &lt;br&gt;The reason why IC Send is not placed inside of Stacked Macro is that it would mess up the way stacked macro is displayed. This way it's just more convenient and flexible in panel design.
# Go back to Massive panel, unlock it, and move '''IC Send''' module to desired position. Then lock the panel again. Open IC Send menu and select '''ClosedHihat:Cut''':&lt;br&gt;[[Image:8 ic send to cut.gif]]&lt;br&gt;It will send the modulation track values to '''Cutoff''' knob in HiHat instrument and move it automatically! Make sure to select MOD 1 sequence in Massive panel, because this is the modulation sequence we use, one of three at your disposal in Massive. Just imagine - if you add 2 more IC Send modules to the other two modulation sequencers, and send the signal to different knobs, you will get a lively modulated drum track, especially if the lenght of modulation sequences is not the same, they can make nice, varied permutations...
# Have fun!

==Comment==
In this example we use IC Send to transmit gate signal, which is usually a range 0..1. IC Send and IC Receive modules can send a range of values, which is defined in their properties. The default range is 0..1 - and it works fine for gate signal. It won't work though with note pitch, which is range 0..127. To send pitch through IC Send and IC Receive you must change the range of both modules in their properties to 0..127. If you don't change it and leave the default min and max values, the receive module will always show 1 (the default max value) since the values incoming to IC Send are usually above 1 (60 for C3).

Use exactly four 4's to form ''every [[wikipedia:integer|integer]] from 1 to 50'', using only the operators '&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;', '&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;', '&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;', '&lt;math&gt;/&lt;/math&gt;', '()' (brackets) &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; (square), and '!' ([[wikipedia:factorial|factorial]]). The square and factorial operators should be used as sparingly as possible. If 44 (which is 4 x 10 + 4) can be avoided, avoid it. In this version of the problem, the square root operator is not allowed.

The field of computing as we know it today started in 1947 with three scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories—[[w:William Shockley|William Shockley]], [[w:Walter Brattain|Walter Brattain]], and [[w:John Bardeen|John Bardeen]]—and their groundbreaking invention: the [[w:transistor|transistor]]. In 1956, the first fully transistor-based computer, the [[w:TX-0|TX-0]], was completed at MIT. The first [[w:integrated circuit|integrated circuit]] was created in 1958 by [[w:Jack Kilby|Jack Kilby]] at Texas Instruments, but the first high-level programming language existed even before then.

&quot;The [[w:Fortran|Fortran]] project&quot; was originally developed in 1954 by IBM. A shortening of &quot;''The IBM Mathematical '''For'''mula '''Tran'''slating System''&quot;, the project had the purpose of creating and fostering development of a procedural, imperative programming language that was especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. It was a breakthrough in terms of productivity and programming ease (compared to assembly language) and speed (Fortran programs ran nearly as fast as, and in some cases, just as fast as, programs written in assembly). Furthermore, Fortran was written at a high-enough level (and thus was machine independent enough) to become the first widely adopted programming language. The Algorithmic Language ([[w:ALGOL 58|Algol 58]]) was derived from Fortran in 1958 and evolved into [[w:ALGOL 60|Algol 60]] in 1960. The [[w:Combined Programming Language|Combined Programming Language (CPL)]] was then created out of Algol 60 in 1963. In 1967, it evolved into [[w:BCPL|Basic CPL]], which was itself, the base for [[w:B (programming language)|B]] in 1969. Finally, B, the root of C, was created in 1971.

C was the direct successor of B, a stripped down version of BCPL, created by [[w:Ken Thompson|Ken Thompson]] at Bell Labs, that was also a [[w:compiled language|compiled language]] - [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/kbman.pdf User's Reference to B], used in early internal versions of the UNIX operating system.  As noted in Ritchie's [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html C History] : &quot;The B compiler on the PDP-7 did not generate machine instructions, but instead 'threaded code', an interpretive scheme in which the compiler's output consists of a sequence of addresses of code fragments that perform the elementary operations. The operations typically — in particular for B — act on a simple stack machine&quot;.  Thompson and [[w:Dennis Ritchie|Dennis Ritchie]], also working at Bell Labs, improved B and called the result NB. Further extensions to NB created its logical successor, C. Most of UNIX was rewritten in NB, and then C, which resulted in a more portable operating system.

The portability of UNIX was the main reason for the initial popularity of both UNIX and C. Rather than creating a new operating system for each new machine, system programmers could simply write the few system-dependent parts required for the machine, and then write a C compiler for the new system. Since most of the system utilities were thus written in C, it simply made sense to also write new utilities in C.

The American National Standards Institute began work on standardizing the C language in 1983, and completed the standard in 1989. The standard, ANSI X3.159-1989 &quot;Programming Language C&quot;, served as the basis for all implementations of C compilers.  The standards were later updated in 1990 and 1999, allowing for features that were either in common use, or were appearing in C++.

==Getting Started==
The goal of this book is to introduce you to the C programming language. Basic computer literacy is assumed, but no special knowledge is needed.

Before you can start programming in C, you will need a '''C [[w:Compiler|compiler]]'''. A compiler is a program that converts C code into executable [[w:machine code|machine code]].&lt;ref&gt;Actually, GCC's(GNU C Compiler) '''cc''' (C Compiler) translates the input .c file to the target cpu's assembly, output is written to an .s file. Then '''as''' (assembler) generates a machine code file from the .s file. Pre-processing is done by another sub-program '''cpp ''' (C PreProcessor), which is not to be confused with '''c++''' the compiler.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum software requirements to program in C is a [[w:Text Editor|text editor]], as opposed to a [[w:Word Processor|word processor]]. A plain text Notepad Editor can be used but it does not offer any advanced capabilities such as code completion or debugging. There are many text editors (see [[w:List of text editors|List of Text Editors]]), among the most popular are [[w:Notepad++|Notepad++]] for Windows, [[w:Sublime Text|Sublime Text]], [[w:Vim (text editor)|Vim]] and [[w:Emacs|Emacs]] are also available cross-platform. These text editors come with [[w:syntax highlighting|syntax highlighting]] and line numbers, which makes code easier to read at a glance, and to spot syntax errors.

Though not absolutely needed, many programmers prefer and recommend using an [[w:Integrated development environment|Integrated development environment]] ('''IDE''') instead of a text editor. An IDE is a suite of programs that developers need, combined into one convenient package, usually with a graphical user interface. These programs include a text editor, linker, project management and sometimes bundled with a compiler. They also typically include a debugger, a tool that will preserve your C source code after compilation and enable you to do such things as step through it manually, or alter data as an aid to finding and correcting programming errors.

For beginners it is recommended not to use an IDE, since it hides most of what is going on. Using the command line builds up familiarity with the toolchain. An IDE may be useful to somebody with programming experience but knows how the IDE works. So as a general guideline: Do not use an IDE unless you know what the IDE does!

On '''GNU/Linux''', GCC is almost always included automatically.

On '''Microsoft Windows''', Dev-C++ is recommended for beginners because it is easy to use, free, and simple to install. Although the initial developer (Bloodshed) hasn't updated it since 2005, a new version appeared in 2011, made by an independent programmer, and is being actively developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate option for those working only in the Windows environment is the proprietary Microsoft Visual Studio Express which is free of charge and has an excellent debugger.

On '''Mac OS X''', the Xcode IDE provides the compilers needed to compile various source files. The newer versions do not include the command line tools. They need to be downloaded via Xcode-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Downloads.

===Dev-C++===
[[w:Dev-C Plus Plus|Dev C++]] is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) for the C++ programming language, available from [http://www.bloodshed.net/ Bloodshed Software]. An updated version is available at [http://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.com/ Orwell Dev-C++].&lt;br /&gt;
C++ is a programming language which contains within itself most of the C language, plus extensions. Most C++ compilers will compile C programs, sometimes with a few adjustments (like invoking them with a different name or command line switch). Therefore, you can use Dev C++ for C development.

However, Dev C++ is not the compiler. It is designed to use the [[w:MinGW|MinGW]] or [[w:Cygwin|Cygwin]] versions of [[Wikipedia:GCC|GCC]] - both of which can be obtained as part of the Dev C++ package, although they are completely different projects. &lt;br /&gt;
Dev C++ simply provides an editor, syntax highlighting, some facilities for the visualisation of code (like class and package browsing) and a graphical interface to the chosen compiler. Because Dev C++ analyses the error messages produced by the compiler and attempts to distinguish the line numbers from the errors themselves, the use of other compiler software is discouraged since the format of their error messages is likely to be different.

The latest version of Dev-C++ is a [[Wikipedia:beta version|beta]] for version 5. However, it still has a significant number of bugs. All the features are there, and it is quite usable. It is considered one of the best free software C IDEs available for Windows.

A version of Dev C++ for Linux is in the pipeline. It is not quite usable yet, however. Linux users already have a wealth of IDEs available. (e.g. [[w:KDevelop|KDevelop]] and [[w:Anjuta|Anjuta]].) Most of the graphical text editors, and other common editors such as ''emacs'' and ''vi(m)'', support [[w:syntax highlighting|syntax highlighting]].

===GCC===
The [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) is a [[w:free software|free]] set of compilers developed by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]].


;Steps for Obtaining the GCC Compiler if You're on GNU/Linux:
On '''GNU/Linux,''' Installing the GNU C Compiler can vary in method from [[w:Linux distribution|distribution]] to distribution. (Type in '''cc -v''' to see if it is installed already.)
* For [[w:Redhat|Redhat]], get a GCC [[w:RPM Package Manager|RPM]], e.g. using Rpmfind and then install (as root) using &lt;code&gt;rpm -ivh gcc-''version''-''release''.''arch''.rpm&lt;/code&gt;
* For [[w:Fedora Core|Fedora Core]], install the GCC compiler (as root) by using &lt;code&gt;[[w:yum|yum]] install gcc&lt;/code&gt;.
* For [[w:Mandrake|Mandrake]], install the GCC compiler (as root) by using &lt;code&gt;[[w:urpmi|urpmi]] gcc&lt;/code&gt;
* For [[w:Debian|Debian]], install the GCC compiler (as root) by using &lt;code&gt;[[w:Advanced Packaging Tool|apt-get]] install gcc&lt;/code&gt;.
* For [[w:Ubuntu|Ubuntu]], install the GCC compiler (along with other necessary tools) by using &lt;code&gt;sudo [[w:Advanced Packaging Tool|apt-get]] install build-essential&lt;/code&gt;,  or by using Synaptic. You do not need Universe enabled.
* For [[w:Slackware|Slackware]], the package is available on their [http://www.slackware.com/pb/ website] - simply download, and type &lt;code&gt;installpkg gcc-xxxxx.tgz&lt;/code&gt;
* For [[w:Gentoo|Gentoo]], you should already have GCC installed as it will have been used when you first installed.  To update it run (as root) &lt;code&gt;emerge -uav gcc&lt;/code&gt;.
* For [[w:Arch Linux|Arch Linux]], install the GCC compiler (as root) by using &lt;code&gt;pacman -S gcc&lt;/code&gt;.
* If you cannot become root, get the GCC tarball from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ and follow the instructions in it to compile and install in your home directory. Be warned though, you need a C compiler to do that - yes, GCC itself is written in C.
* You can use some commercial C compiler/IDE.


;Steps for Obtaining the GCC Compiler if You're on BSD Family Systems:
* For [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]], [[w:FreeBSD|FreeBSD]], [[w:NetBSD|NetBSD]], [[w:OpenBSD|OpenBSD]], [[w:DragonFly BSD|DragonFly BSD]], [[w:Darwin|Darwin]] the port of GNU gcc is available in the base system, or it could be obtained using the ports collection or [[w:pkgsrc|pkgsrc]].


;Steps for Obtaining the GCC Compiler if You're on Windows:
There are two ways to use GCC on Windows: Cygwin and MinGW. Applications compiled with Cygwin will not run on any computer without Cygwin, so MinGW is recommended. MinGW is simpler to install, and takes less disk space.

To get MinGW, do this:
# Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ download and save this to your hard drive.
# Once the download is finished, open it and follow the instructions. You can also choose to install additional compilers, or the tool Make, but these aren't necessary.
# Now you need to set your PATH. Right-click on &quot;My computer&quot; and click &quot;Properties&quot;. Go to the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab and click on &quot;Environment variables&quot;. Go to the &quot;System variables&quot; section and scroll down until you see &quot;Path&quot;. Click on it, then click &quot;edit&quot;. Add &quot;;C:\mingw\bin\&quot; (without the quotes) to the end.
# To test if GCC works, open a command prompt and type &quot;gcc&quot;. You should get the message &quot;gcc: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated.&quot;. If you get this message, GCC is installed correctly.

To get Cygwin, do this:
# Go to http://www.cygwin.com and click on the &quot;Install Cygwin Now&quot; button in the upper right corner of the page.
# Click &quot;run&quot; in the window that pops up, and click &quot;next&quot; several times, accepting all the default settings.
# Choose any of the Download sites (&quot;ftp.easynet.be&quot;, etc.) when that window comes up; press &quot;next&quot; and the Cygwin installer should start downloading.
# When the &quot;Select Packages&quot; window appears, scroll down to the heading &quot;Devel&quot; and click on the &quot;+&quot; by it. In the list of packages that now displays, scroll down and find the &quot;gcc-core&quot; package; this is the compiler.  Click once on the word &quot;Skip&quot;, and it should change to some number like &quot;3.4&quot; etc. (the version number), and an &quot;X&quot; will appear next to &quot;gcc-core&quot; and several other related packages that will now be downloaded.
# Click &quot;next&quot; and the compiler as well as the Cygwin tools should start downloading; this could take a while.  While you're waiting for the installation to finish, download any text-editor designed for programming.  While Cygwin does include some, you may prefer doing a web search to find other alternatives.  While using a stock text editor is possible, it is not ideal. 
# Once the Cygwin downloads are finished and you have clicked &quot;next&quot;, etc. to finish the installation, double-click the Cygwin icon on your desktop to begin the Cygwin &quot;command prompt&quot;.  Your home directory will automatically be set up in the Cygwin folder, which now should be at &quot;C:\cygwin&quot; (the Cygwin folder is in some ways like a small unix/linux computer on your Windows machine -- not technically of course, but it may be helpful to think of it that way).
# Type &quot;gcc&quot; at the Cygwin prompt and press &quot;enter&quot;; if &quot;gcc: no input files&quot; or something like it appears you have succeeded and now have the gcc compiler on your computer (and congratulations -- you have also just received your first error message!).

The current stable (usable) version of GCC is 4.9.1 published on 2014-07-16, which supports several platforms. In fact, GCC is not only a C compiler, but a family of compilers for several languages, such as C++, [[Ada Programming|Ada]], [[Java]], and [[Fortran]].

Once gcc is installed, it can be called with a list of c source files
that have been written but not yet compiled. eg.  there is a main.c file
that includes a some functions described in myfun.h and implemented 
in myfun_a.c   and  myfun_b.c   ,  then it is enough to write

  gcc   main.c myfun_a.c myfun_b.c 

myfun.h  is included in main.c  , but if is in a separate header files
directory , then that directory can be listed after a  &quot;-I &quot; switch.

In larger programs,  Makefiles and gnu make program can compile
c files into intermediate files ending with suffix  .o which can be linked
by gcc.

How to compile each object file is usually described in the Makefile
with the object file as a label ending with a colon followed by two spaces 
(tabs are often bad characters) followed by a list of other files that are 
dependencies, eg. .c files and .o files compiled in another section,
and on the next line, the invocation of gcc that is required.
typing   &lt;code&gt;man  make&lt;code&gt;  or  &lt;code&gt;info make&lt;/code&gt;   often gives the information 
needed to jog the memory on how to use make, and the same
goes for gcc, although gcc has a lot of option switches, the
main ones being -g to generate debugging for gdb to allow
it to show source code during stepping through of the machine
code program.  gdb has a 'h' command that shows what it can do,
and is usually started with  'gdb a.out'  if a.out is the anonymous
executable machine code file that was compiled by gcc.

=== Embedded systems ===
* Most CPUs are microcontrollers in embedded systems, often programmed in C, but most of the compilers mentioned above (except GCC) do not support such CPUs. For specialized compilers that do support embedded systems, see [[Embedded Systems/C Programming]].

=== Other C compilers ===
We have a long [[C Programming/Compilers | list of C compilers]] in a much later section of this Wikibook.
''Which of those compilers would be suitable for beginning C programmers, that we should say a few words about getting started with that particular compiler in this section of this Wikibook?''

As with nearly every other programming language learning book, we use the ''[[w:Hello world program|Hello world]]'' program to introduce you to C.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
   return 0;
}
  
&lt;/source&gt;
This program prints &quot;Hello, world!&quot; and then exits.

And if you want to hold the output and it does not exit, you may use the &lt;code&gt;getchar();&lt;/code&gt; as following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
   getchar();
   return 0;
}
  
&lt;/source&gt;
Enter this code into your text editor or IDE, and save it as &quot;hello.c&quot;.

Then, presuming you are using GCC, type &lt;code&gt;gcc -o hello hello.c&lt;/code&gt;. This tells gcc to compile your hello.c program into a form the machine can execute. The '-o hello' tells it to call the compiled program 'hello'.

If you have entered this correctly, you should now see a file called hello. This file is the binary version of your program, and when run should display &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

Here is an example of how compiling and running looks when using a terminal on a unix system. &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; is a common unix command that will list the files in the current directory, which in this case is the directory &lt;code&gt;progs&lt;/code&gt; inside the home directory (represented with the special tilde, ~, symbol). After running the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; command, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; will list a new file, &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; in green. Green is the standard color coding of &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; for executable files. 

 ~/progs$ ls
 hello.c
 ~/progs$ gcc -o hello hello.c
 ~/progs$ ls
 &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;  hello.c
 ~/progs$ ./hello
 Hello, world!
 ~/progs$

===Part-by-part explanation===

&lt;code&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tells the C compiler to find the standard header called ''[[w:stdio.h|&lt;stdio.h&gt;]]'' and add it to this program. In C, you often have to pull in extra optional components when you need them. ''&lt;stdio.h&gt;'' contains descriptions of standard input/output functions which you can use to send messages to a user, or to read input from a user.

&lt;code&gt;int main(void)&lt;/code&gt; is something you'll find in every C program. Every program has a ''main'' function. Generally, the main function is where a program begins.  However, one C program can be scattered across multiple files, so you won't always find a main function in every file.
The ''int'' at the beginning means that main will return an integer to the operating system when it is finished.

&lt;code&gt;puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; is the statement that actually puts the message to the screen. ''puts'' is a string printing function that is declared in the file ''stdio.h'' (which is why you had to ''#include'' that at the start of the program) &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; automatically prints a newline at the end of the string.

&lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt; will return zero (which is the [[w:en:Integer (computer science)|integer]] referred to on line 3) to the operating system. When a program runs successfully its return value is zero (GCC4 complains if it doesn't when compiling). A non-zero value is returned to indicate a warning or error.

The empty line is there because it is (at least on UNIX) considered good practice to end a file with a new line. In gcc using the &lt;code&gt;-Wall -pedantic -ansi&lt;/code&gt; options, if the file does not end with a new line this message is displayed: &quot;warning: no newline at end of file&quot;. (The newline isn't shown on the example because MediaWiki automatically removes it)

==Introductory Exercises==

===On GCC===
If you are using a Unix(-like) system, such as [[w:GNU/Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]], or [[w:Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]], it will probably have GCC installed. Type the hello world program into a file called first.c and then compile it with gcc. Just type:

 gcc first.c

Then run the program by typing:

 ./a.out

or, If you are using Cygwin.

 a.exe


You should now see your very first C program.



There are a lot of options you can use with the gcc compiler. For example, if you want the output to have a name other than a.out, you can use the -o option. The following shows a few examples:

;&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;: indicates that the compiler is supposed to generate an ''object file'', which can be later linked to other files to form a final program.
;&lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt;: indicates that the next parameter is the name of the resulting program (or library).  If this option is not specified, the compiled program will, for historic reasons, end up in a file called &quot;a.out&quot; or &quot;a.exe&quot; (for cygwin users).
;&lt;code&gt;-g3&lt;/code&gt;: indicates that ''debugging information'' should be added to the results of compilation.
;&lt;code&gt;-O2 -ffast-math&lt;/code&gt;: indicates that the compilation should be optimized.
;&lt;code&gt;-W -Wall -fno-common -Wcast-align -Wredundant-decls -Wbad-function-cast -Wwrite-strings -Waggregate-return -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes&lt;/code&gt;: indicates that gcc should warn about many types of suspicious code that are likely to be incorrect.
;&lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt;: indicates that gcc should only preprocess the code; this is useful when you are having trouble understanding what gcc is doing with #include and #define, among other things.


All the options are well documented in the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.0/gcc/Debugging-Options.html manual page] for GCC.

=== The Classical &quot;Hello, World!&quot; Program ===
Tradition dictates that we begin with a very simple program, which simply displays the characters &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on the screen and immediately exits.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
  return 0;
} 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The task itself sounds like it should be simple enough, and the truth of the matter is that most of the above code is what some refer to as [[w:Boilerplate_code | boilerplate code]]. The line that's doing the work we're interested in is &lt;code&gt;printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an example of a [[w:Macro_(computer_science) | macro]].
Loosely speaking, '''macros''' allow us to tell a part of the compiler - the '''preprocessor''' - to modify the code we've written before it is compiled. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; macro is retrieving C code that has already been written from the file stdio.h. Files used in this way are called '''header files''' and are saved with the '''.h''' extension. In this program, the only thing we needed from &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; was the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function.

Both &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; are examples of C's [[C_Programming/Preliminaries#Basics_of_Using_Functions | functions]]. Although they serve similar purposes, functions are quite different from macros. We'll be committing a great deal of discussion to each later. In computer science, the term '''function''' tends to be used a bit more loosely than in mathematics. For now, it suffices to say that functions let us define a complex process that we want to reference frequently.

Finally, we consider the last line, &lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt;. When the operating system executes our program, it's useful to be able to let the OS know whether or not the program succeeded. We do this with an '''exit status''', which we send to the operating system by C's &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement. In this case, we provide an exit status of &quot;0&quot; to indicate that execution succeeded without error. As our programs grow in complexity, we can use other integers as codes to indicate other types of errors. This style of providing exit statuses is a [http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Exit-Status.html long standing convention].

You probably have a few more questions, like ''What's up with this '' &lt;code&gt;int argc, char** argv&lt;/code&gt; ''business? That's weird.'' or ''Why is it'' &lt;code&gt;int main&lt;/code&gt; ''instead of just'' &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;''?'' Don't worry! We'll get to that in short order.

===On IDEs===
If you are using a proprietary IDE you may have to select console project, and to compile you just select build from the menu or the toolbar. The executable will appear inside the project folder, but you should have a menu button so you can just run the executable from the IDE.

One can also find opensource IDE's like [[w:Eclipse_(software)|Eclipse]], [[w:Netbeans|Netbeans]] or [[w:Qt_Creator|Qt Creator]]. The process will be the same as in a proprietary IDE.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hypopharynx Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*2,500-3,000 annual cases in US
*Pyriform sinus most common (65-75%), posterior pharyngeal wall 10-20%, postcricoid region 5-15%
*Majority (&gt;80%) present with Stage III-IV disease
*Highly associated with tobacco use; EtOH impact not as clear (per Perez, 5th ed). Also occupational exposure to dust, iron compounds, fumes
*HPV associated in 20-25%, clinical implications not yet clear
*May arise in the setting of [[w:Plummer-Vinson_syndrome|Plummer-Vinson syndrome]], characterized by iron deficiency anemia, hypopharyngeal webs, weight loss, and dysphagia


==Anatomy==
*Extent
**Superior extent - level of superior border of hyoid bone / floor of valecula
**Inferior extent - level of lower border of cricoid cartilage
**Anterior extent - connection of the two pyriform sinuses at post cricoid region. 
**Posterior extent - posterior pharyngeal wall

*Subsites
**Bilateral pyriform sinuses
***Extends from pharyngoepiglottic fold to upper end of esophagus, at the lower border of cricoid cartilages
***Superiorly are surrounded by thyrohyoid membrane, through which passes the internal branch of superior laryngeal nerves. Tumor involvement can result in referred otalgia
**Postcricoid region
***Mucosa overlying cricoid cartilage. Arytenoids and AE folds form the superior border. Esophageal mucosa forms the inferior border
**Posterior pharyngeal wall
***Squamous mucosa covering middle/inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles, typically &lt;1 cm thinck


==Nodal Drainage==
*Rich lymphatic network draining through thyrohyoid membrane into jugulodigastric LNs; there may also be direct drainage to spinal accessory LNs
*Typical primary drainage for posterior pharyngeal wall: Level II and III, typically below jugulodigastric LN
*Surgical reports show direct drainage to lateral retropharyngeal LNs, bypassing jugulodigastric LNs
*Case report from Dana Farber shows involvement of retropharyngeal LNs at base of skull
*&gt;50% present with clinically positive LNs


*'''Dana Farber, 2007''' PMID 17290070 -- &quot;Retropharyngeal nodes in hypopharynx cancer on positron emission tomography.&quot; (Allen AM, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 10;25(5):599-601.)
**Case report. Hypopharynx T2N1 (2.5cm right jugulodigastric LN)
**PET/CT: Additionally bilateral lateral retropharyngeal nodes (nodes of Rouviere) positive. Patient upstaged to Stage IV (T2N2c)
**Conclusion: recommend including lateral retropharyngeal LNs to base of skull in IMRT volumes

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)'''
&lt;br&gt;'''''Primary Tumor'''''
*T1 - one subsite of hypopharynx and &lt;= 2 cm
:''AJCC Subsites: left/right pyriform sinus, left/right lateral hypopharyngeal wall, posterior hypopharyngeal wall, postcricoid region
*T2 - more than one subsite of hypopharynx or adjacent site, or &gt;2 but &lt;=4 cm
*T3 - &gt;4 cm, or fixation of hemilarynx or extension to esophagus
*T4a - invades thyroid or cricoid cartilage, hyoid, thyroid gland, central compartment soft tissue (e.g, strap muscles, subcutaneous fat)
*T4b - invades prevertebral fascia, encases carotid, involves mediastinum

Note: T4a and T4b are the same as for larynx (glottic, subglottic, and supraglottic)


'''''Regional Lymph Nodes'''''
{{Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Node staging}}


'''''Distant Metastasis'''''
*MX - Cannot be assessed
*M0 - No distant metastasis
*M1 - Distant metastsis


'''''Clinical Stage'''''
*Stage 0 - Tis N0 M0
*Stage I - T1 N0 
*Stage II - T2 N0 
*Stage III - T3 or N1
*Stage IVA - T4a or N2
*Stage IVB - T4b or N3
*Stage IVC - M1

'''Changes from 6th edition:'''
&lt;br&gt;Extension to esophagus is now T3 instead of T4a.

===Older staging systems===

==Treatment==
*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering; 2007''' PMID 17493769 -- &quot;Concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers.&quot; (Lee NY, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Oct 1;69(2):459-68. Epub 2007 May 9.)
**Retrospective. 20 larynx and 11 hypopharynx patients, treated with IMRT and concurrent platinum-based chemo. Most Stage IV disease. RT dose painting GTV 70 Gy (@2.12 Gy/fx), high-risk CTV 59.4 Gy (@1.8 Gy/fx, typically Levels II-IV; Levels I or V not routinely contoured unless judged high risk eg positive Level II), low-risk CTV 54 Gy (@1.64 Gy/fx, uninvolved contralateral neck and base of skull). Chemo cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Q3W or carbo 60-70 mg/m2 + 5-FU 600 mg/m2. Median F/U 2.2 years
**Outcome: 2-year LC 86%, RC 94%, laryngectomy-free 89%, DM-free 92%, OS 63%. 
**Toxicity: No late G2+ xerostomia. PEG-dependent hypopharynx 31% vs. larynx 15%
**Conclusion: IMRT + chemo encouraging LR control in advanced larynx/hypopharynx. However,  high rate of PEG dependency

*'''Kyushu, 2005''' (Japan) PMID 15936545 -- &quot;Chemoradiation therapy with or without salvage surgery for early squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.&quot; (Nakamura K, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**43 patients with Stage I/II: 30-40 Gy +/- chemo, if complete response (75%), RT to 61.2 Gy
**5-year OS 70.4%, DSS 89.5%
**Conclusion: Majority of patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer was curable. However, second malignancies influenced the overall outcome of patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer.

==Pre-op RT vs. Post-op RT==
*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43). 
**'''10-years; 1999''' PMID 1993628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized study of preoperative versus postoperative radiation therapy in advanced head and neck carcinoma: long-term follow-up of RTOG study 73-03.&quot; (Tupchong L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Jan;20(1):21-8.)
***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). Oral cavity (14%), oropharynx (17%), &lt;u&gt;hypopharynx (43%)&lt;/u&gt;, supraglottic larynx (26%) 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting


==Induction Chemo-RT vs. Primary RT alone==
*'''RTOG 68-01'''
**Randomized. 638 patients, Stage III-IV oral cavity (23%), oropharynx (55%), supraglottic larynx (12%), &lt;u&gt;hypopharynx (10%)&lt;/u&gt;. Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) IV MTX 25 mg q3d x5 followed by RT. RT 55-80 Gy
**'''1980''' PMID 7410127 -- &quot;Adjuvant intravenous methotrexate or definitive radiotherapy alone for advanced squamous cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx or hypopharynx.&quot; (Fazekas JT, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 May;6(5):533-41.)
***Outcome: median OS RT vs. MTX-RT: oral cavity 11.8 mo vs. 12.4 mo, oropharynx 13.6 mo vs. 13.1 mo, SGL 17.2 mo vs. 19.2 mo, &lt;u&gt;hypopharynx 9.7 mo vs. 13.4 mo&lt;/u&gt;
***Conclusion: Minimal gain, induction methotrexate should not be used


==Laryngectomy + RT vs. Chemo-RT==
*'''EORTC 24891''' (1990-1993) - Surgery + post-op RT vs Induction cisplatin/5-FU + RT
**Randomized. 194/202 patients. Operable SCC of the pyriform sinus or AE fold, Stage T2-T4 N0-N2b, N3 (N2c initially allowed, stopped in 1992). Arm 1) Immediate surgery + post-op RT 50-70 Gy vs. Arm 2) Induction cisplatin 100 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles. If CR, then RT 70 Gy. If PR, then cisplatin/5-FU x another cycle. If CR, then RT 70 Gy. If PR, or PD anytime, then surgery. RT given 50 Gy bilateral neck + 20 Gy boost to tumor/palpable LNs. Surgery was total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy to allow primary closure
**'''4-years; 1996''' PMID 8656441 &amp;mdash; &quot;Larynx preservation in pyriform sinus cancer: preliminary results of a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase III trial. EORTC Head and Neck Cancer Cooperative Group.&quot; Lefebvre JL et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Jul 3;88(13):890-9.) Median F/U 4.25 years 
***Outcome: median OS surgery 2.1 years vs. chemo-RT 3.7 years (equivalent). Larynx preservation 3-years 42%, 5-years 35%. LF 12% vs. 17%, RF 19% vs. 23% 
***Conclusion: Larynx-preserving strategy is feasible, induction chemo followed by RT is new standard treatment for EORTC.
**'''10-years; 2004''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=26&amp;abstractID=3215 ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;Is laryngeal preservation (LP) with induction chemotherapy (ICT) safe in the treatment of hypopharyngeal SCC? Final results of the phase III EORTC 24891 trial.&quot; (Lefebvre JL, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2004 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition). Vol 22, No 14S (July 15 Supplement), 2004: 5531) Median F/U 10 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS surgery 33% vs. chemo-RT 38%; 10-year OS 14% vs. 13%. 5-year PFS 26% vs. 32%. Larynx preservation 5-years 22% (58% survivors), 10-years 9% (69% survivors)
***Conclusion: Similar survival curves with larynx preservation as with conventional total laryngectomy, with 2/3 survivors retaining their larynx

==Primary Chemo-RT Timing Strategies==
*'''France''' (2001-2005) -- Induction chemo-RT vs. concurrent chemo-RT

Most C compilers have one or more &quot;extensions&quot; to the standard C language, to do things that are inconvenient to do in standard, portable C.

Some examples of language extensions:

* in-line assembly language
* interrupt service routines
* variable-length data structure (a structure whose last item is a &quot;zero-length array&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://c-faq.com/struct/structhack.html comp.lang.c FAQ list: Question 2.6]: &quot;C99 introduces the concept of a flexible array member, which allows the size of an array to be omitted if it is the last member in a structure, thus providing a well-defined solution.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* re-sizeable multidimensional arrays
* various &quot;#pragma&quot; settings to compile quickly, to generate fast code, or to generate compact code.
* bit manipulation, especially bit-rotations and things involving the &quot;carry&quot; bit
* storage alignment
* Arrays whose length is computed at run time.

==Assembler==

See [[Embedded Systems/Mixed C and Assembly Programming]]

==Cg==
Make the main program ( for CPU)  in C, which loads and run the [[Cg_(programming_language)|Cg]] program ( for GPU ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=47 Lesson: 47 from NeHe Productions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1903.asp Cg Bumpmapping by Razvan Surdulescu at GameDev]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusionindustries.com/default.asp?page=cg-hlsl-faq | Cg &amp; HLSL Shading Language FAQ
 by Fusion Industries]&lt;/ref&gt;

#include &lt;Cg/cg.h&gt; /* To include the core Cg runtime API into your  program */
#include &lt;Cg/cgGL.h&gt;  /* to include the OpenGL-specific Cg runtime API */
&lt;/source&gt;

===Minimal program===
* by bobobobo&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobobobo.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/cg-1/ Absolutely minimal CG program for good fundamentals understanding]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Java==

Using the Java native interface (JNI), Java applications can call C libraries.

See also
* [[Java_Programming/Keywords/native]]

==Perl==
To mix Perl and C, we can use XS. XS is an interface description file format used to create an extension interface between Perl and C code (or a C library) which one wishes to use with Perl.

The basic procedure is very simple. We can create the necessary subdirectory structure by running &quot;h2xs&quot; application (e.g. &quot;h2xs -A -n Modulename&quot;). This will create - among others - a Makefile.PL, a .pm Perl module and a .xs XSUB file in the subdirectory tree. We can edit the .xs file by adding our code to that, let's say:
 void
 hello()
   CODE:
     printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
and we can successfully use our new command at Perl side, after running a &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; and &quot;make&quot;.

Further details can be found on the [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlxstut.html perlxstut] [http://perldoc.perl.org perldoc] page.

==Python==
[http://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html Here can be found some details about extending Python with modules written in C]. You might read about [http://cython.org/ Cython] and [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/ Pyrex] as well, that makes easier to create modules in C, translating a Python-like code into C.
{{sect-stub}}
Using the Python [https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html ctypes] module, one can write C code directly into Python.

[[Wikipedia:C (programming language)|C]] is the most commonly used programming language for writing [[Wikipedia:operating systems|operating systems]]. The first operating system written in C is [[Wikipedia:Unix|Unix]]. Later operating systems like [[Wikipedia:Linux|GNU/Linux]] were all written in C. Not only is C the language of operating systems, it is the precursor and inspiration for almost all of the most popular high-level languages available today. In fact, [[Wikipedia:Perl|Perl]], [[Wikipedia:PHP|PHP]], [[Wikipedia:Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Wikipedia:Ruby_(programming_language)|Ruby]] are all written in C.

By way of analogy, let's say that you were going to be learning Spanish, Italian, French, or Portuguese. Do you think knowing Latin would be helpful? Just as Latin was the basis of all of those languages, knowing C will enable you to understand and appreciate an entire family of programming languages built upon the traditions of C. Knowledge of C enables freedom. 

===Why C, and not assembly language? ===

While assembly language can provide speed and maximum control of the program, C provides portability.

Different processors are programmed using different Assembly languages and having to choose and learn only one of them is too arbitrary. In fact, one of the main strengths of C is that it combines  universality and portability across various computer architectures while retaining most of the control of the hardware provided by assembly language.

For example, C programs can be compiled and run on the HP 50g calculator (ARM processor), the TI-89 calculator (68000 processor), Palm OS Cobalt smartphones (ARM processor), the original iMac (PowerPC), the Arduino (Atmel AVR), and the Intel iMac (Intel Core 2 Duo).  Each of these devices has its own assembly language that is completely incompatible with the assembly language of any other.

[[Wikipedia:Assembly language|Assembly]], while extremely powerful, is simply too difficult to program large applications and hard to read or interpret in a logical way. C is a compiled language, which creates fast and efficient executable files. It is also a small &quot;what you see is all you get&quot; language: a C statement corresponds to at most a handful of assembly statements, everything else is provided by library functions.

So is it any wonder that C is such a popular language?

Like toppling dominoes, the next generation of programs follows the trend of its ancestors. Operating systems designed in C always have system libraries designed in C. Those system libraries are in turn used to create higher-level libraries (like [[Wikipedia:OpenGL|OpenGL]], or [[Wikipedia:GTK|GTK]]), and the designers of those libraries often decide to use the language the system libraries used. Application developers use the higher-level libraries to design word processors, games, media players and the like. Many of them will choose to program in the language that the higher-level library uses. And the pattern continues on and on and on...

=== Why C, and not another language? ===

The primary design of C is to produce portable code while maintaining performance and minimizing footprint ([[Wikipedia:CPU time|CPU time]], [[Wikipedia:Computer memory|memory]], disk I/O, etc.). This is useful for [[Wikipedia:Operating systems|operating systems]], [[Wikipedia:Embedded systems|embedded systems]] or other programs where performance matters a lot (&quot;high-level&quot; interface would affect performance). With C it's relatively easy to keep a mental picture of what a given line really does, because most of the things are written explicitly in the code. C has a big codebase for low level applications. It is the &quot;native&quot; language of UNIX, which makes it flexible and portable. It is a stable and mature language which is unlikely to disappear for a long time and has been ported to most, if not all, platforms.

One powerful reason is memory allocation. Unlike most programming languages, C allows the programmer to write directly to memory. Key constructs in C such as structs, pointers and arrays are designed to structure and manipulate memory in an efficient, machine-independent fashion. In particular, C gives control over the memory layout of data structures. Moreover dynamic memory allocation is under the control of the programmer (which also means that memory deallocation has to be done by the programmer). Languages like [[Wikipedia:Java (programming language)|Java]] and Perl shield the programmer from having to worry about memory allocation and pointers. This can be useful since dealing with memory allocation when building a high-level program is a highly error-prone process. However, when dealing with low-level code such as the part of the OS that controls a device, C provides a uniform, clean interface. These capabilities just do not exist in most other languages.

While Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby may be powerful and support many features not provided by default in C, they are not normally implemented in their own language. Rather, most such languages initially relied on being written in C (or another high-performance programming language), and would require their implementation be ported to a new platform before they can be used.

As with all programming languages, whether you want to choose C over another high-level language is a matter of opinion and both technical and business requirements could dictate which language is required.

==Epidemiology==
Less than 3% of all malignancies. 36,000 cases/yr in 2005.  12,660 deaths. 
&lt;br&gt;80% have localized disease at presentation.
&lt;br&gt;Renal cell carcinoma makes up 85% of kidney cancer.
&lt;br&gt;25% present with advanced disease.

==Pathology==
Adenocarcinoma. 
&lt;br&gt;Conventional (clear cell) renal carcinoma - 80%. Papillary renal carcinoma - 12%. Others: chromophobe -4%, oncocytoma (benign), collecting duct, unclassified.

Papillary has 5-yr OS of 90%, 5:1 male predominance. Metastasizes less frequently than does clear cell.

Oncocytomas are benign, but often a kidney is resected for suspected RCC. Collecting duct RCC is aggressive.

VHL gene mutation in 60% of sporadic clear cell RCC.

==Syndromes==
*Von-Hippel Lindau disease (retinal angiomas, CNS hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, clear cell renal carcinoma) -- see [[Radiation Oncology/Cancer Syndromes|Radiation Oncology:Cancer Syndromes]].

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - 7 cm or less, limited to the kidney
**T1a - 4 cm or less
**T1b - 4-7 cm
*T2 - &gt; 7 cm, limited to the kidney
**T2a - &gt;7 but &amp;le;10 cm
**T2b - &gt;10 cm
*T3 - extends into major veins or perinephric tissues but not into ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia
**T3a - extends into renal vein or invades perirenal and/or renal sinus fat but not beyond Gerota's fascia
**T3b - extends into the vena cava below the diaphragm
**T3c - extends into vena cava above the diaphragm or invades the wall of the vena cava
*T4 - invades beyond Gerota's fascia (including contiguous extension into the adrenal gland)

&lt;br&gt;''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
:Regional nodes - renal hilum, caval (para/pre/retrocaval), interaortocaval, aortic (para/pre/retroaortic)
*N0 - no
*N1 - yes

&lt;br&gt;''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - no distant mets
*M1 - distant mets

&lt;br&gt;''Stage Grouping:''
*I - T1 N0
*II - T2 N0
*III - T3 or N1
*IV - T4 or M1

&lt;br&gt;''Changes from 6th Edition:''
*Subdivided T2 into T2a and T2b based on size
*Invasion of adrenal moved to T4 (was T3)
*Invasion of renal vein moved to T3a (was T3b)
*N-stage is N0 or N1 instead of N0-2
*Stage grouping remains essentially the same

===Older staging systems===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
''Primary Tumor:''
*T1 - 7 cm or less, limited to the kidney
**T1a - 4 cm or less
**T1b - 4-7 cm
*T2 - &gt; 7 cm, limited to the kidney
*T3 - extends into major veins or invades adrenal gland or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerota's fascia
**T3a - invades adrenal gland or perirenal and/or renal sinus fat but not beyond Gerota's fascia
**T3b - grossly extends into renal vein or its segmental branches, or the vena cava below the diaphragm
**T3c - extends into vena cava above the diaphragm or invades the wall of the vena cava
*T4 - invades beyond Gerota's fascia

&lt;br&gt;''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - no nodal mets
*N1 - single node
*N2 - more than one node

&lt;br&gt;''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - no distant mets
*M1 - distant mets

&lt;br&gt;''Stage Grouping:''
*I - T1 N0
*II - T2 N0
*III - T3 or N1
*IV - T4 or N2 or M1

==Treatment==
Standard treatment for nonmetastatic RCC is complete resection of the tumor by either a radical or partial nephrectomy. Adjuvant therapy is not standard.

==Prognosis==
30% of pts will relapse after surgery.  Response rates for metastatic RCC are poor, only 15-25%.

Adverse prognostic factors:
*nodal and venous involvement (Memorial Sloan Kettering) - PMID 8270978 

Relapse according to stage (including median time to relapse):
*Levy, M.D.Anderson - PMID 9507823 
*T1 - 7%, 38 months
*T3 - 40%, 17 months
**especially poor prognosis for T3 with venous invasion

==Nomograms==
*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering'''
**[http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/6156.cfm nomogram link]
**'''2001''' PMID 11435824 -- &quot;A postoperative prognostic nomogram for renal cell carcinoma.&quot; (Kattan MW, J Urol. 2001 Jul;166(1):63-7.)

==Survival==
5-yr survival:
*Stage I - 95%
*Stage II - 88%
*Stage III - 59%
*Stage IV - 20%; median 13 months

==Adjuvant treatment==
===Neoadjuvant approach===
*Preoperative embolization of the renal artery
**PMID 10683065 (Zielinksi H et al 2000)
**Retrospective. 474 pts. 118 had embolization. All had radical nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy with embolization.
**5 and 10-year OS 62% and 47% (embolization) vs 35% and 23% (surgery alone)

===Adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy===
*medroxyprogesterone - similar relapse rate (PMID 2934557)
*VAU (vinblastine, doxorubicin, UFT (tegafur-uracil)) - Japanese study. Retrospective. Improved survival. (PMID 1394804)

===Immunotherapy===
*'''Interferon alpha and IL-2'''
**Used with success in metastatic setting

*'''ECOG Adjuvant Interferon Trial''' (PMID 12663707)
**294 pts. Randomized after surgery to 12 weeks IFN-alpha or observation.
**Median f/u 10 years. No difference in recurrence or survival. Significant toxicities of treatment.

*'''IL-2''' - also failed to show a benefit in the adjuvant setting

===Vaccines===
*Jocham et al. Lancet 2004
**Cell lysates incubated with gamma-IFN/tocopherol acetate.
**558 pts. T2-3b N0/1. After nephrectomy, randomized to vaccine or observation.
**Improvement in tumor progression rate, but only for T3 tumors.

===Ongoing trials===
*Heat shock protein vaccines - induces a stronger immunogenic reponse than with tumor antigen alone
*Thalidomide
*Adoptive immunotherapy - passive transfer of immuno cells
**LAK - lymphokine-activated killer cells
**TIL - tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes

==Use of radiotherapy==
===Meta-Analysis===
*'''Karachi; 2010''' PMID 20139152 -- &quot;Need for a new trial to evaluate postoperative radiotherapy in renal cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials&quot; (Tuni MA, Ann Oncol. 2010 Feb 5. [Epub ahead of print])
**Meta-analysis. 7 RCT, 735 patients. Radical nephrectomy vs radical nephrectomy + post-op RT for localized RCC
**Outcome: Significant reduction in locoregional failure; no difference in DFS or OS
**Toxicity: Generally well tolerated
**Conclusion: PORT significantly reduces LRF, without impact on DFS or OS. However, poor accrual and older RT techniques

===Randomized===
*'''Copenhagen Renal Cancer Study Group''', 1987 (1979-84) - PMID 3445125 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial of postoperative radiotherapy versus observation in stage II and III renal adenocarcinoma.&quot; Kjaer M et al. Scand J Urol Nephrol. 1987;21(4):285-9. 
**72 pts. Stage II-III. After nephrectomy, randomized to RT vs observation. RT was 50 Gy in 20 fx to kidney bed, ipsilateral and contralateral nodes
**No benefit for relapse rate or survival. Unacceptable toxicities from RT.

===Radiobiology===
*Renal cell carcinoma cells were the most radiation-resistant cells among 694 cell lines (271 tumor-derived and 423 fibroblast-derived), with D = 4.8Gy (compared with for example melanoma D = 2.51Gy)
**'''Paris, 1996''' (France) PMID 12118559 -- &quot;A review of human cell radiosensitivity in vitro.&quot; (Deschavanne PJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Jan 1;34(1):251-66.)

==Stereotactic Radiotherapy==
*'''Karolinska Sweden 1997-2003''' PMID 15972239 -- ''Extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy for primary and metastatic renal cell carcinoma.'' ('''2005 Wersall''' PJ, Radiother Oncol. 2005 Oct;77(1):88-95.)
**Retrospective. 58 patients treated with SRT (8 Gy x4, 10 Gy x4, or 15 Gy x3)
**Response: 30% CR, 60% PR/SD; Local control 90-98%
**Mild side effects
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our use of SRT for patients with primary and metastatic RCC yielded a high local control rate with low toxicity. Patients with one to three metastases, local recurrences after nephrectomy or inoperable primary tumors benefited the most, i.e. had fewer distant recurrences (13/23) and longer survival times compared to patients with &gt;3 metastases (24/27 recurrences).&quot;


==Brain Mets==
*''Also please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases|main brain metastases page]]


===Epidemiology===
*Percentage of patients who develop brain mets: only 3-14% (but majority of these have multiple brain mets)
*Majority of patients with brain mets also have active disease elsewhere, typically lung


*'''Japan, 1995''' (1981-1992) PMID 7637246 -- &quot;[Clinical study of renal cell carcinoma with brain metastasis]&quot; - [Article in Japanese] (Yonese J, Nippon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi. 1995 Jul;86(7):1287-93.)
**Retrospective. 130 patients with renal cell CA, 10.6% developed brain mets (&gt;90% of these had prior pulmonary mets)

*'''1981''' PMID 7272969 -- &quot;Distant metastasis of renal adenocarcinoma.&quot; (Saitoh H, Cancer. 1981 Sep 15;48(6):1487-91.)
**Retrospective. 1451 autopsy cases. Brain mets ~10%

===Whole Brain RT===
*WBRT results have historically been poor with standard fractionations, due to perceived radioresistance
*But, median survival of MD Anderson cohort (4.4 months) is the same as median survival in RTOG RPA meta-analysis PMID 9128946 (4.4 months). The Cleveland Clinic cohort did worse, possibly since they had almost no RPA Class I patients (who were typically treated with WBRT + surgery or + SRS)
*There may be benefit for patients with multiple brain mets and with RPA Class I

*'''Germany, 2010''' PMID 20488627 -- &quot;Do Patients Receiving WBRT for Brain Metastases from RCC Benefit from Escalation of the Radiation Dose?&quot; (Rades D, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 May 18.)
** Retrospective analysis of 60 pts receiving 30/10 vs 40/20 or 45/15. Majority of pts were RPA Class 2-3 (13% RPA 1, 42% RPA 2, 45% RPA 3). 30/10 used in 31 pts; higher dose in 29 pt (23 pt treated with 40/20, 6 pt with 45/15).
** 1 yr OS 13% vs 47% for low vs high dose (SS on MVA)
** 1 yr local control 7% vs 35% for low vs high dose (trend p=0.06 on MVA)
**Conclusion: Suggest escalation above 3 Gy x 10 improves outcomes in brain mets from RCC.

*'''Cleveland Clinic, 2004'''(1983-2000) PMID 14697446 -- &quot;Results of whole brain radiotherapy and recursive partitioning analysis in patients with brain metastases from renal cell carcinoma: a retrospective study.&quot; (Cannady SB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jan 1;58(1):253-8.)
**Retrospective. 46 patients with RCC treated with WBRT. Median RT 30/10. Median F/U 3 months
**Median OS: 3 months. RPA I 8.5 months (but only 2 patients!) vs. RPA Class II 3 months vs. RPA Class III 0.6 months
**RT: higher dose associated with better OS, but confounded by RPA
**Conclusion: despite poor prognosis, there is benefit to WBRT over supportive care

*'''MD Anderson''' 
**'''1997''' (1976-1993) PMID 9128947 -- &quot;External radiation of brain metastases from renal carcinoma: a retrospective study of 119 patients from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.&quot; (Wronski M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Mar 1;37(4):753-9.)
***Retrospective. 119 patients treated with WBRT only. Multiple tumors in 60%
***Survival: median 4.4 months. (single met 4.4 months, multiple mets 3.0 months). 76% neurologic cause of death, 16% systemic progression
***Conclusion: unsatisfactory results suggest more aggressive approaches
**'''1988''' (1968-1985) PMID 2458823 -- &quot;Palliative radiotherapy for brain metastases in renal carcinoma.&quot; (Maor MH, Cancer. 1988 Nov 1;62(9):1912-7.)
***Retrospective. 46 patients with RCC brain mets. Mostly WBRT 30/10
***Median survival: 8 weeks. 10 patients improved after WBRT, median OS 17 weeks
***Conclusion: brain mets from renal cell usually unresponsive to conventional photon therapy

*'''Jefferson, 1985''' (1956-1981) PMID 2414257 -- &quot;Radiation therapy in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&quot; (Onufrey V, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1985 Nov;11(11):2007-9.)
**Retrospective. 125 with metastatic lesions (12 brain mets). Total doses 20-60 Gy
**Response rate: 65% of TDF &gt;70, 25% for TDF &lt;70
**Conclusion: kidney mets should be treated to higher doses

*'''1983''' (1965-1980) PMID 6185207 -- &quot;The role of radiation therapy in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&quot; (Halperin EC, Cancer. 1983 Feb 15;51(4):614-7.)
**Retrospective. 35 patients palliated for met renal CA, 60 sites (10 CNS)
**CNS: disappointing results. 30% response in brain and SC lesions

===SRS===
*Patients treated with SRS appear to do better than patients treated with WBRT (as a historical comparison)
*Role of WBRT in addition to SRS is unclear. It probably improves local control; its effect on distant brain failure and survival is unclear based on several single-institution retrospective reviews


*'''Utah, 2006''' No PMID [http://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016(06)02653-8/abstract link] &lt;!--removedPMID 17070401--&gt; -- &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery as therapy for melanoma, renal carcinoma, and sarcoma brain metastases: Impact of added surgical resection and whole-brain radiotherapy.&quot; (Rao G, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Nov 15;66(4 Suppl):S20-5.)
**Retrospective. 68 patients with brain mets (melanoma 68%, RCC 28%, sarcoma) treated with SRS +/- WBRT or surgery. KPS &gt;70

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Thaumaturge. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Thaumaturge~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Measuring the heat capacity of solids and gases was one of the first clues that we live in a quantum world.
Classically, the heat capacity was constant at 1/2Nk per degree of freedom. This would put at a gas at 3/2Nk. Where k is Boltzmann's constant.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined as heat capacity per unit mass.

==Experimental Values==
When people started looking at heat capacity around the turn of century, they discovered some interesting things about how it changed with temperature. These problems took many years to figure out, including many attempts to create models.
[[Image:Heat_Capacity_vs_Temperature.png|thumb|Heat capacity of a Diatomic Gas]]

==Heat Capacity of a Quantum Oscillator==
If we take a single quantum oscillator with energy
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Then by summing over n with a Boltzmann distibution for energy. We get a value fot the internal energy of the oscillator.

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\sum_n ^\infty e_n p_n&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\sum_n \hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) e^{\hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)/kT}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2} +\sum_n \hbar\omega n e^{\hbar\omega\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)/kT}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\hbar\omega}{2} + \frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\hbar\omega/{kT} +1}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

When we differentiate this with respect to T, we get the Heat Capacity.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{dU}{dT}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
When we look at the high a low temperature limits for this we see that at high temperatures we get the classical result: C = k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. At the low temperature limit we get that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C = k_B \left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_b T}\right)^2 e^{\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_b T}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==The Harmonic crystal approximation==
One reason why solids are easy to study is that the atoms in a solid are held very tightly to their equilibrium positions. So tightly, in fact, that all the atoms may be assumed to execute coupled simple harmonic motion about their mean positions.

==Einstein's model for a solid==
Einstein's model pretty much said that a solid was comprised of 3N quantum oscillators, it provided quite a good model at higher temperatures, but near T = 0K, it didn't agree with experimental values.Let derive the mathematical expression for that.

First Einstein assumed that in solids, the electrons are in the form of waves that don't react with each other (in the real case this does not happen but it can be a good approximatin in some cases). Making this assumption, according to Einstein, the probability f(v) that an oscillator has frequency v is given by &lt;math&gt;f(v) = \frac{1}{e^{\frac{hv}{kT}}-1}&lt;/math&gt;.also internal energy of a solid is E=3Nhvf(v).So Einstein specific heat is 
&lt;math&gt;c_v=\frac{dE}{dT}_v = 3R\frac{hv}{kT}*\frac{hv}{kT}*\frac{e^{\frac{hv}{kT}}}{\left(e^{\frac{hv}{kT}}-1\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Debye's Model==
Debye's model was a large improvement over Einstein's, it was based on the fact that the individual atoms do not oscillate independently. He said that waves travel through the material, these '''phonons''' were the important part. The maths is a bit more complicated in Debye's model, but is essentially the same as a boson gas, for example, it's analogous to photons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over the past few years, you might have come across the term artificial intelligence and have imagined it to be a vivid personification of extraterrestrial beings or robots. But, what is artificial intelligence in fact? In this section, we will explore the meaning and semantics of the term artificial intelligence.

== Overview ==
Artificial intelligence is the search for a way to map intelligence into mechanical hardware and enable a structure into that system to formalize thought. No formal definition, as yet, is available for as to what artificial intelligence actually is. Over the course of this section, we will try to formulate a working definition, reasoning and articulating facts and preferences of various other authors and practitioners of the field. To start with, we would think of the word ''artificial'' and ''intelligence'' as main sources of inspiration and come up with a brief description of the same as follows:

{{cquote|Artificial Intelligence is the study of human intelligence such that it can be replicated artificially.}}

With our first set of formal declaration of the concept, we tread gradually through different semantics of it and try to explore a much broader definition for AI. In their book ''Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'', authors Russell and Norvig tried to establish a clear classification of the definition of the field into distinct categories based on working definitions from other authors commenting on AI. The demarcation of concepts holds true to these clauses for systems that:

* Think and act like humans
* Think and act rationally

So, one would be tempted to improve upon the definition given above to include these facts into perspective such that the definition that we end up with says that:

{{cquote|Artificial Intelligence is the study of human intelligence and actions replicated artificially, such that the resultant bears to its design a reasonable level of rationality.}}

=== What is A.I.? ===
There are numerous definitions of what artificial intelligence is. 

We end up with four possible goals:
# Systems that think like humans (focus on reasoning and human framework)
# Systems that think rationally (focus on reasoning and a general concept of intelligence)
# Systems that act like humans (focus on behavior and human framework)
# Systems that act rationally (focus on behavior and a general concept of intelligence)

What is '''[[w:rationality|rationality]]'''? &lt;tt&gt; -&gt; &lt;/tt&gt;&quot;doing the right thing&quot; - simply speaking.

Definitions: 

For (1.): &quot;The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by humans&quot; (Kurzweil). Involves cognitive modeling - we have to determine how humans think in a literal sense (explain the inner workings of the human mind, which requires experimental inspection or psychological testing)

For (2.): &quot;GPS - [[w:General Problem Solver|General Problem Solver]]&quot; (Newell and Simon). Deals with &quot;right thinking&quot; and dives into the field of logic. Uses logic to represent the world and relationships between objects in it and come to conclusions about it. Problems: hard to encode informal knowledge into a formal logic system and theorem provers have limitations (if there's no solution to a given logical notation).

For (3.): Turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool a human person ([[w:Turing Test|Turing Test]]).Physical contact to the machine has to be avoided, because physical appearance is not relevant to exhibit intelligence. However, the &quot;Total Turing Test&quot; includes appearance by encompassing visual input and robotics as well.

For (4.): The rational agent - achieving one's goals given one's beliefs. Instead of focusing on humans, this approach is more general, focusing on agents (which perceive and act). More general than strict logical approach (i.e. thinking rationally).

=== Strong AI vs. Weak AI ===

* '''[[w:Strong AI|Strong AI]]''' = machine-based artificial intelligence that can truly reason and becomes self-aware (sentient), either human-like (thinks and reasons like a human mind) or non-human-like (different form of sentience and reasoning) - coined by John Searle: &quot;an appropriately programmed computer IS a mind&quot; (see [[w:Chinese Room|Chinese Room Experiment]]).

* '''[[w:Weak AI|Weak AI]]''' = machine-based artificial intelligence that can reason and solve problems in a limited domain. Hence it acts as if it were intelligent in that domain, but would not be truly intelligent or sentient.

=== Turing Test ===

A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot reliably tell which is which, then the machine is said to pass the [[w:Turing Test|test]]. It is assumed that both the human and the machine try to appear human.

==== Objections ====
# A machine passing the test could simulate human behavior, but this might be considered much weaker than intelligence - the machine might just follow a set of cleverly designed rules. Turing rebutted this by saying that maybe the human mind is just following a set of cleverly designed rules as well.
# A machine could be intelligent without being capable of conducting conversations with humans
# Many humans might fail this test, if they're illiterate or inexperienced (e.g. children)

=== Chinese Room Experiment ===

Tried to debunk the claims of &quot;'''[[w:Strong AI|Strong AI]]'''&quot;. Searle opposed the view that the human mind IS a computer and that consequently, any appropriately construed computer program could also be a mind. 

==== Outline ====
A man who doesn't speak Chinese sits in a room and is handed sheets of paper with Chinese symbols through a slit. He has access to a manual with a comprehensive set of rules on how to respond to this input. Searle argues, that even though he can answer correctly, he doesn't understand Chinese; he's just following '''syntactical''' rules and doesn't have access to the meaning of them. Searle believes that &quot;mind&quot; emerges from brain functions, but is more than a &quot;computer program&quot; - it requires [[w:intentionality|intentionality]], [[w:consciousness|consciousness]], [[w:subjectivity|subjectivity]] and [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation mental causation].

=== Mind-Body Problem ===
The problem deals with the relationship between '''mental''' and '''physical''' events. Suppose I decide to stand up. My decision could be seen as a mental event. Now something happens in my brain (neurons firing, chemicals flowing, you name it) which could be seen as a physical, measurable event. How can it be, that something &quot;mental&quot; causes something &quot;physical&quot;. Hence it's hard to claim that both are completely different things. One could go on and claim that these mental events are, in fact, physical events: My decision '''is''' neurons firing, but I'm not aware of this - I feel like I made a decision independently from the physical. Of course this works the other way round too: everything physical could, in fact, be mental events. When I stand up after having made the decision (mental event), I'm not physically standing up, but my actions cause mental events in my and the bystanders minds - physical reality is an illusion.

=== Frame Problem ===
It is the question of how to determine which things remain the same in a changing environment.

=== Problem-Solving ===

Occurs whenever an organism or artificial intelligence is at some current state and does not know how to proceed in order to reach a desired '''goal''' state. This is considered to be a problem that can be solved by coming up with a series of actions that lead to the goal state (the &quot;solving&quot;).

== Search ==
=== Overview ===
In general, search is an algorithm that takes a problem as input and returns with a solution from the searchspace. The '''search space''' is the set of all possible solutions. We dealt a lot with so called &quot;state space search&quot; where the problem is to find a goal state or a path from some initial state to a goal state in the state space. A state space is a collection of states, arcs between them and a non-empty set of start states and goal states. It is helpful to think of the search as building up a search tree - from any given node (state): what are my options to go next (towards the goal), eventually reaching the goal.

=== Uninformed Search ===

Uninformed search (blind search) has no information about the number of steps or the path costs from
the current state to the goal. They can only distinguish a goal state from a non-goal state. There is ''no bias'' to go towards the desired goal.

For search algorithms, ''open list'' usually means the set of nodes yet to be explored and ''closed list'' the set of nodes that have already been explored. 

# '''[[w:Breadth first search|Breadth-First-Search]]'''
#* Starts with the rootnode and explores all neighboring nodes and repeats this for every one of those (expanding the &quot;depth&quot; of the search tree by one in each iteration). This is realized in a ''FIFO'' queue. Thus, it does an exhaustive search until it finds a goal. 
#* '''BFS''' is ''complete'' (i.e. it finds the goal if one exists and the branching factor is finite). 
#* It is ''optimal'' (i.e. if it finds the node, it will be the shallowest in the search tree). 
#* Space: &lt;math&gt;O(b^d)&lt;/math&gt;
#* Time: &lt;math&gt;O(b^d)&lt;/math&gt;
# '''[[w:Depth-first search|Depth-First-Search]]'''
#* Explores one path to the deepest level and then backtracks until it finds a goal state. This is realized in a ''LIFO'' queue (i.e. stack). 
#* '''DFS''' is ''complete'' (if the search tree is finite). 
#* It is '''not''' ''optimal'' (it stops at the first goal state it finds, no matter if there is another goal state that is shallower than that). 
#* Space: &lt;math&gt;O(bm)&lt;/math&gt; (much lower than '''BFS'''). 
#* Time: &lt;math&gt;O(b^m)&lt;/math&gt; (Higher than '''BFS''' if there is a solution on a level smaller than the maximum depth of the tree). 
#* Danger of running out of memory or running indefinitely for infinite trees.
# '''[[w:Depth-limited search|Depth-Limited-Search]] / [[w:Iterative deepening depth-first search|Iterative Deepening]]'''
#* To avoid that, the search depth for '''DFS''' can be either limited to a constant value, or increased iteratively over time, gradually increasing the maximum depth to which it is applied. This is repeated until finding a goal. Combines advantages of '''DFS''' and '''BFS'''. 
#* '''ID''' is complete. 
#* It is optimal (the shallowest goal state will be found first, since the level is increased by one every iteration). 
#* Space: &lt;math&gt;O(bd)&lt;/math&gt; (better than '''DFS''', d is depth of shallowest goal state, instead of m, maximum depth of the whole tree).
#* Time: &lt;math&gt;O(b^d)&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Bi-Directional Search'''
#* Searches the tree both forward from the initial state and backward from the goal and stops when they meet somewhere in the middle.
#* It is complete and optimal.
#* Space: &lt;math&gt;O(b^(d/2))&lt;/math&gt;.
#* Time: &lt;math&gt;O(b^(d/2))&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Informed Search ===
In ''informed'' search, a [[w:Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] is used as a guide that leads to better overall performance in getting to the goal state. Instead of exploring the search tree blindly, one node at a time, the nodes that we could go to are ordered according to some [[w:evaluation function|evaluation function]] &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; that determines which node is probably the &quot;best&quot; to go to next. This node is then expanded and the process is repeated (i.e. '''[[w:Best First Search|Best First Search]]'''). '''[[w:A-star search algorithm|A* Search]]''' is a form of '''BestFS'''. In order to direct the search towards the goal, the [[w:evaluation function|evaluation function]] must include some estimate of the cost to reach the closest goal state from a given state. This can be based on knowledge about the problem domain, the description of the current node, the search cost up
to the current node '''BestFS''' optimizes '''DFS''' by expanding the most promising node first. Efficient selection of the current best candidate is realized by a [[w:priority queue|priority queue]].

# '''Greedy Search''':
#* Minimizes the estimated cost to reach the goal. The node that is closest to the goal according to &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is always expanded first. It optimizes the search locally, but not always finds the global optimum. 
#* It is not complete (can go down an infinite branch of the tree).
#* It is not optimal. 
#* Space: &lt;math&gt;O(b^m)&lt;/math&gt; for the worst case.
#* Same for time, but can be reduced by choosing a good heuristic function.
# '''[[w:A-star search algorithm|A* Search]]''':
#* Combines ''uniform cost search'' (i.e. expand node on path with lowest cost so far) and '''greedy search'''. Evaluation function is &lt;math&gt;f(n) = g(n) + h(n)&lt;/math&gt; (or estimated cost of the cheapest solution through node n). It can be proven that A* is complete and optimal if &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:A_star#Intuition_about_why_A.2A_is_admissible_and_computationally_optimal|admissible]] - that is, if it ''never overestimates'' the cost to reach the goal. This is optimistic, since they think the cost of solving the problem is less than it actually is.
#* Examples for &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;: 
#** Path-Finding in a map: Straight-Line-Distance. 
#** 8-Puzzle: Manhattan-Distance to Goal State.
#** Everything works, it just has to be admissible (e.g. &lt;math&gt;h(n) = 0&lt;/math&gt; always works, but transforms A* back to uniform cost search). 
#* If a [[w:Heuristic_evaluation|heuristic function]] &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; estimates the actual distance to the goal better than another heuristic function &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; ''dominates'' &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt;.
#* A* maintains an open list ([[w:priority queue|priority queue]]) and a closed list (visited nodes). If a node is expanded that's already in the closed list, stored with a lower cost, the new node is ignored. If it was stored with a higher cost, it is deleted from the closed list and the new node is processed.
#* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is '''monotonic''', if the difference between the heuristics of any two connected nodes does not overestimate the actual distance between those nodes. Example of a '''non-monotonic''' heuristic: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; are two connected nodes, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the parent of &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;g(n)=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(n)=4&lt;/math&gt;, then we know that the true cost of a solution path through &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is at least 7. Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;g(n')=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(n')=2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;f(n')=6&lt;/math&gt;.
#** First off, the difference in the heuristics (that is, 2) overestimates the actual cost between those nodes (which is 1). 
#** However, we know that any path through &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; is also a path through &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and we already know that any path through &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has a true cost of at least 7. Thus, the f-value of 6 for &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; is meaningless and we will consider its parent's f-value.
#* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is consistent, if the h-value for a given node is less or equal than the actual cost from this node to the next node plus the h-value from this next node (triangular inequality).
#* If &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is '''admissible''' and '''monotonic''', the first solution found by A* is guaranteed to be the optimal solution (open/close list bookkeeping is no longer needed).

Finding Heuristics:
* Relax the problem (e.g. 8-puzzle: Manhattan distance). 
* Calculate cost of subproblems (e.g. 8-puzzle: calculate cost of first 3 tiles).

=== Adversarial Search (Game Playing) === 
[[w:Minimax|Minimax]] is for deterministic games with perfect information. Non-Deterministic games will use the [[w:Expectiminimax tree|expectiminimax]] algorithm.

# [[w:Minimax|Minimax Algorithm]]:
#* A two player [[w:Zero-sum|zero-sum game]], in which both players make a move alternately, is  defined by an initial state (e.g. board positions), a set of operators that define legal moves, a terminal test that defines the end of the game and a [[w:Evaluation function|utility function]] that determines a numeric value for the outcome of the game (e.g. &quot;1&quot; for win, &quot;-1&quot; for loss).
#* If it was a search problem, one would simply search for a path that leads to a terminal state with value &quot;1&quot;. But the opponent (Min) will try to minimize one's (Max') outcome. The '''minimax''' algorithm generates the whole [[w:game tree|game tree]] and applies the [[w:Evaluation function|utility function]] to each terminal state. Then it propagates the utility value up one level and continues to do so until reaching the start node. 
#* Propagation works like this: Min is assumed to always chose the option that is the worst for Max (minimum utility value). If we have three terminal states in one branch with 1, 2 and 3 as their utility values, then Min would chose 1. Hence, &quot;1&quot; is propagated to the next level and so forth. Max can then decide upon his opening move on the top level (the &quot;minimax decision&quot; = maximizing utility under the assumption that the opponent will play perfectly to minimize it).
#* For games that are too complex to compute the whole game tree, the game tree is cut off at some point and the utility value is estimated by a heuristic evaluation function (e.g. &quot;material value&quot; in chess).
# [[w:Alpha-beta_pruning|Alpha-Beta Pruning]]
#* We don't have to look at each node of the game tree: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning yields the same result as a complete search, but with much greater efficiency (reduces its effective branching factor to its square root). 
#* Here we store the best value for Max' play found so far in ''alpha'' and the best value for Min's play found so far (i.e. the lowest value) in ''beta''. 
#* If, at any given point, ''alpha'' becomes smaller than ''beta'', we can prune the game tree at this point. Therefore, it is required to evaluate at least on set of leaf nodes branching off of one of the deepest Min nodes and then use the acquired alpha-value to prune the rest of the search.
# Chance:
#* Introduces &quot;chance nodes&quot; to the decision points, based on what kind of chance is introduced (e.g. a 50/50 chance for flipping a coin), which yield the &quot;expected value&quot; (average - add up utility values weighted by the chance to achieve them).
#* Example: 3 leaf nodes, values 5, 6 and 10 = 21 altogether - the chance to get to any one of them is 1/3 - hence the expected value is &lt;math&gt; 21 * 1/3 = 7&lt;/math&gt;

=== Constraint Satisfaction Problems ===

For [[w:Constraint Satisfaction Problem|CSPs]], states in the search space are defined by the values of a set of variables, which can get assigned a value from a specific domain, and the goal test is a set of constraints that the variables must obey in order to make up a valid solution to the initial problem. 

Example: 8-queens problem; variables could be the positions of each of the eight queens, the constraint to pass the goal test is that no two queens can be such that they harm each  other.

Different types of constraints:
* unary (value of a single variable)
* binary (pairs of variables, e.g. x &gt; y)
* n-ary

In addition to that, constraints can be absolute or preference (the former rules out certain solutions, the latter just says which solutions are preferred). The domain can be discrete or continuous. In each step of the search, it is checked if any variable has violated one of the constraints - if yes: [[w:backtrack|backtrack]] and rule out this path.

'''Forward checking''' checks if any decisions on yet unassigned variables would be ruled out by assigning a value to a variable. It deletes any conflicting values from the set of possible values for each of the unassigned variables. If one of the sets becomes empty - backtrack immediately.

There are also heuristics for making decisions on variable assignments. 

Selecting the next variable:
* ''Most-constrained-variable'' works together with forward checking (checking which values are still allowed for each unassigned variable)
** the next variable to be assigned a value is the one with the ''fewest'' possible values (reduces branching factor).
* ''Most-constraining-variable'' assigns a value to the variable that is involved in the ''largest'' number of constraints on other yet unassigned variables. 

After selecting the variable: 
* ''Least-constraining-value'' assigns a value that rules out the smallest number of values in
variables connected to the current variable through constraints. 

CSP's that work with iterative improvement are often called &quot;'''heuristic repair'''&quot; methods, because they repair inconsistencies in the current configuration. '''Tree-structured''' CSPs can be solved in linear time.

=== Other ===
# [[w:Hill Climbing|Hill Climbing]]
#* Evaluate all neighboring nodes and move to the best one. 
#* If there is no better node than the current node, declare this node to be the optimum and halt. 
#* Risk of getting stuck at [[w:Local_maximum|local maxima]].
# [[w:Simulated Annealing|Simulated Annealing]]
#* Escape local maxima by allowing &quot;bad&quot; moves (descent), but gradually decrease their size and frequency.

{{center|'''''Bones are used for shifting models and making them posable. If you are not ready for this yet and wish to continue simply modeling, please skip this tutorial to the next section.'''''}}

Bones are a modeling tool that are especially important for animating characters.  Bones allow you to move characters' limbs in a way that is much simpler than trying to re-arrange the vertices every time.

It works by associating a bone with particular vertices, causing them to move along with the bone when the position is changed in pose mode.  Using bones is fairly simple once you get the hang of it, but, like many things in Blender, can be a little daunting at first sight.

Bones don't do much on their own; in fact, they turn invisible at render time.  For this following module we'll use the character that we had made by the end of the module [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Putting Hat on Person|Putting Hat on Person]]. You will have to have completed all the modules in [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro#Unit 2: Basic Modeling and Shading|Section 2B]]. Note that while we will be using bones on a simple person, the process can be used with any creature or body type you imagine!

== Laying down bones ==
[[File:Bones Tutorial - Setup.png|right|400px]]

''Note: This just shows the basics of adding bones to an object.  Go to the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/index|advanced animation]] page for a more comprehensive guide on this.''

First of all, we'll need a model to put some bones on! For this tutorial, we're going to use a humanoid model.  Open the model that you had created by the end of the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Putting Hat on Person|Putting Hat on Person]] tutorial, or download a pre-made model from [http://www.nusoy.com/blender here].

Here's our setup, with Block Dude standing on a plane. You can add a plane by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|A}} &amp;rarr; ''Mesh'' &amp;rarr; ''Plane''. Scale the plane to an appropriate size and move it so that it is approximately underneath the person.

'''Noob note:''' You will be placing armatures (&quot;bones&quot;) inside your humanoid, so you must work in &quot;wireframe mode,&quot; not &quot;solid mode.&quot; Otherwise, you will not be able to see the armatures when you place them. To toggle between &quot;solid&quot; and &quot;wireframe,&quot; press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}. You may find it helpful to make the wireframe less complex by hiding the subsurface mesh. You can do this by going to the Modifier context panel [[File:Blender255ObjectModifiersContextButton.png]] of the Properties window [[File:Blender 2.59 Properties ico.png]] and deselecting the eye button.

'''Note:''' An alternative to working in &quot;wireframe mode&quot; is to turn &quot;X-Ray&quot; on for the armature. To do this, select the armature. In the properties panel under ''object data'' there is a display menu. Click &quot;X-Ray&quot; in the second field of buttons. This will allow the armature to show through other objects.

== Add a bone ==
[[File:Bones Tutorial - First Bone.png|right|400px]]

Now, let's put some bones on Block Dude! In Object Mode press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|A}} ''&amp;rarr; Armature &amp;rarr; Single Bone''.

What we are looking at is an armature. This is a single bone. Now, we need to put the bone in Block Dude! Move and rotate the bone so that it's in the middle of Block Dude's chest. If your bone does not have the correct length, then change the size of the bone by moving one of the ends of the bone: switch to Edit Mode, select one of the ends of the bone, then move it using {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}. Alternatively, you can scale it using {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}
{{clear}}

== Extrude a second Bone ==
[[File:Bones Tutorial - Finished Skeleton.png|right|400px]]
To create a second bone starting from one of the ends of the first bone, switch to Edit Mode with the bone selected, select the end of the bone, then extrude {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} the end. A second bone appears, with its start point on the selected end of the first bone. Move the mouse to position the end point, then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}, or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Space}}. Scale the bone as needed to fit it in his body, and continue adding bones by extruding the end points. These operate much the same way as vertices: you can extrude, rotate, move, and even subdivide. Your finished result should look something like this:
{{clear}}

== Name the bones ==
[[File:Bones Tutorial - Naming Bone.png|right|400px]]
Now, just to make things easier, we're going to name the bones. For example, my bones are named &quot;Right Forearm&quot;, &quot;Left Forearm&quot;, &quot;Right Upper Arm&quot;, etc. While in Edit mode, select the bone you want to rename. In the Outliner [[File:Blender 2.59 Outliner ico.png]], the bone you have selected will be visible with a circle around it [[File:Blender Armature Bone icon (selected).png]]. You may need to expand the Armature Object [[File:Blender Armature Object icon.png]], Armature Data Object [[File:Blender Armature Data icon.png]] and any parent bones before being able to view the selected bone. In the Bone context panel [[File:Blender270BoneContextButton.PNG]] of the Properties window click the name field to edit the name. 

'''Noob Note:''' When you are naming the bones remember that if you are looking at the person from the front, your left is the person's right. To make the naming easier switch to viewing the person from behind using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Num1}}.)

== Parent the bones ==
Now, we need to parent the bones to the mesh.  Go back into Object Mode and select Block Dude (and the Hat, assuming you made one).  Now, select the Armature as well, so that it is the last object selected, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|P}}. The Parenting Menu will pop up. Select ''Armature Deform'' &amp;rarr; ''With Automatic Weights''. The person (and hat) are now children of the armature.

'''Noob Note:''' The selection order is important in defining which object is the parent, so you cannot select both objects at the same time. You must select the armature last to make it the parent.

== Moving the Bones ==
[[File:Bones Tutorial - Finished Render.png|right|400px]]
To move individual bones, you have to go into Pose Mode. Select the Armature in Object Mode and switch to Pose Mode by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Tab}} or selecting the mode in the mode selection menu of the 3D Viewer. Try moving a bone around by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} to select it, and then hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} to move it.

If you've done everything correctly, your mesh should move when you move the bones! If this doesn't happen, scale the bones up so that they fit better in the mesh, and scale up the bones until they do what you want (read comment in the parenting section above on adjusting the bones envelopes if you do not get an effect while moving/rotating the bones). With the bones now, you can put Block Dude into a lot of different positions without moving individual vertices.

To the right is an example of how you can move Block Dude with the bones.

Also while in pose mode if after a {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} click you can't move bones with {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}, check the &quot;Move Object Centers Only&quot; button (just to the right of the Rotation/Scaling Pivot button).
{{clear}}

== In-Depth Info on Selected Bone Topics ==
===Add/remove mesh from bone control===
[[File:Bones Tutorial - Vertex Grouping.png|400px|right]]
'''Noob Note:''' If you've been adding bones to your simple person from the previous lessons, you will have likely noticed that the hat seems to stretch when you move the arms in pose mode. To fix this, you will need to remove the hat from the forearm vertex groups created in the Parenting step.

To manually change the mesh areas that the bones control, go to Object Mode and select the object you want to add/remove (if the mesh is inside the same object, then select only the areas of the mesh you want to work with in Edit Mode).

In this case, select the Hat.

Switch to the Object Data context panel in the Properties window and scroll to the &quot;Vertex Groups&quot; submenu.

Now pick the bone group from the dropdown above the Assign/Remove buttons, and then hit Assign (or Remove) as necessary. Usually vertices will be assigned to one group, but can be assigned to multiple groups. In this case, we want to remove the Hat from the Forearm vertex groups. Select the Forearm vertex groups and press the remove button, as pictured. With both of the Forearm vertex groups removed from the hat, it should be able to move properly with the rest of the armature.

====Mesh deforms like it's far away from the bones==== 
If the mesh is properly assigned to the bones they will move regardless of whether the bones are inside the volume of the mesh or not (HOW they deform WILL be affected however). The most common mistake in this step is creating and (more importantly) parenting the mesh to the armature while the armature is outside the mesh, which causes Blender not to assign vertices to any bone groups at all.

You can check this by editing the object (i.e. select the mesh and switch to Edit Mode, then un-select all vertices by pressing A until nothing is selected). Pick the ''Object data'' context then select a vertex group in the ''Object data tab''', press '''Select'''. This will select the vertices associated with the bone group. If the wrong vertices appear selected, you need to assign them manually as explained above.

If there is no effect, in Edit mode select that bone (or bones) and choose Envelope display mode ('''Properties''' window [[File:Blender 2.59 Properties ico.png]], ''Armature context panel &amp;rarr; Display &amp;rarr; Envelope''), then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Alt|S}} and increase its area of influence to cover all faces that should be influenced by the bone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cuisine|Nepal}} | [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]]

'''Nepali cuisine''' is variable, influenced by [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibetan cuisine]] in the north of the country and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|northern Indian cuisine]] in the south.   dal-bhat-tarkari (Nepali: दाल भात तरकारी ) is eaten throughout the country. Dal is a soup made of lentils and spices. It is served over boiled grain, bhat -- usually rice but sometimes another grain—with vegetable curry, tarkari. Typical condiments are a small amount of extremely spicy chutney (चटनी) or achaar (अचार). These can be made from fresh ingredients, or may be a kind of fermented pickle. The variety of these preparations is staggering, said to number in the thousands.[1] Other accompaniments may be sliced lemon (kagati) or lime (nibua) and fresh chili peppers, khursani, cucumber slices, radish and onion slices. Some foods are hybrid of Chinese/Tibetian and Indian foods, like momo, Tibetian dumplings with Indian spices, found generally in Newa cuisine, originally filled with buffalo meat, but now also with goat, chicken meat as well as different vegetables and cottage cheese. There are also foods eaten during festivals like Sel roti, Patre, etc., eaten generally in tihar. New food varieties have also been made like Taas, (made first by a restaurant (Bhet Ghat) owner from Narayanghat Chitwan) which have gained wide popularity around the country, eaten generally with muri/bhuja (puffed rice), it is like Sekuwa (barbecued goat meat).

Hill Bahun (Brahmins), Chhetris Have traditionally eaten Goat meat (Khasi) and fish. However with land suitable for irrigated rice paddies in short supply, other grains supplement or even dominate. Wheat becomes unleavened flat wheat bread (roti or chapati). Maize (makai), buckwheat (fapar), barley (jau) or millet (kodo) become porridge-like (dhido or ato). Tarkari can be spinach or greens (sag), fermented and dried greens (gundruk or sinki), daikon radish (mula), potatoes (alu), green beans (simi), tomatoes (golbeda), cauliflower (kauli), cabbage (bandakopi)), pumpkin (pharsi), etc. Fruit traditionally grown in the hills include mandarin orange (suntala), kaffir lime (kaguti), lemon (nibuwa), Asian pear (nashpati), and bayberry (kaphal). Yogurt (dahi) and curried meat (masu) or fish (machha) are served as side dishes when available. Chicken (Kukhura), and fish are usually acceptable to all but the highest Brahmin (Bahun) caste, who limit meat to Goat (Khasi). Observant Hindus never eat beef (gaiko masu), except untouchables (dalit) possibly eating animals that have died of natural causes. In Pahari communities, domestic pork (sungurko masu) was traditionally only eaten by Magars, Kirats and Dalits, However bangur ko masu wild boar was traditionally hunted and eaten by Chhetris. A strain derived from wild boar is now raised in captivity and used for meat that is increasingly popular with Pahari ethnicities and castes that did not traditionally eat pork.

The central Nepal, including the Kathmandu Valley, specially newar community,is reach in variety of dishes. The newari cuisines includes the buff meat as main ingredient in non-veg cooking which is used to prepare various traditional &quot;newari&quot; dishes like &quot;chhoyala&quot;, &quot;kachila&quot;, &quot;kawaf&quot;, &quot;janla&quot;, &quot;takha&quot;, &quot;nya-khunha&quot;, &quot;takula&quot;,&quot;chikula&quot;, &quot;la wo lapi&quot;, &quot;khago&quot;, &quot;syapumhicha&quot;, &quot;tisya&quot;, &quot;nhepu&quot;, &quot;chohi&quot;, &quot;soo&quot; etc. The veg items include &quot;woo&quot;,&quot;chatamari&quot;, (can be varied as minced meat stuffed, simple, with egg, and with vegetable), &quot;Yomari&quot; , &quot;Paun kwa&quot;, &quot;pancha kwa&quot; , &quot;mee kwa&quot;,&quot;hyela&quot;, and others with various vegetables and beans. The widely used &quot;achar&quot; includes the mixed salad like pickle made up of mixing potatoes,sesame seeds, cucumber and other seasonal raw vegetables. The other famous &quot;achar&quot; are made of tomatoes and dried fish for non-veg. For vegetarians, dried fish can be replaced by fried tofu or cottage cheese. &quot;Lapsi&quot; is another ingredient that is used for &quot;achar&quot;, which can be mixed with seasonal vegetables and fruits or it can alone make it. For soft drink, a rice-beer known as &quot;tho&quot; is used. For hard drink, it is &quot;aela&quot;.

Terai cuisine - Food in Outer Terai grades into cuisines of adjacent parts of India such as Maithili[4] cuisine in the east, Bihari and Bhojpuri cuisine in the center and near west. Further west there is Uttar Pradeshi and even Mughlai-influenced Awadhi cuisine—particularly eaten by the substantial Muslim population around Nepalganj and beyond. Terai diets can be more varied than in the Middle Hills because of greater variety of crops grown locally plus cash crops imported from cooler microclimates in nearby hill regions as well as from different parts of India. Fruit commonly grown in the Terai include mango (aap), litchi, papaya (mewa/papeeta), banana (kera/kela) and jackfruit (katahar/katahal).

Nepali cuisine uses spices such as [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]], and [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]; and [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]] are eaten as staples.  This southern-influenced brand of Nepali cuisine is different from Indian cuisine mainly in the much more moderate usage of oil and spices.

Influences from the north include bamboo-shoots, preserved vegetables (various [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]]/[[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] vegetables), and dried vegetables ([[Cookbook:Gundruk|gundruk]] and [[Cookbook:Sinki|sinki]]), which are regularly and commonly eaten.  Also popular are steamed dumplings ([[Cookbook:Momo|momos]]), usually eaten with a sauce made, variably, of [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]], and [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is intended for small scale raising of chickens often referred to as &quot;Hobby Farming&quot;.  Raising chickens can be very entertaining. They also make a good environmentally friendly way of disposing of organic waste; there is very little that a chicken won't eat. Chickens are flock birds and you'll probably get more than one.

PHP IS JUST A SCRIPT INTERPRETER, OUTPUTTING DATA. IT DOESN'T OUTPUT BOLD TEXT, DOES IT?
[[User:Wykis|Wykis]] 18:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)


the BOLD tag element '''does''' exist in XHTML. [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp w3]

Added the missing &lt;/b&gt; closing tags for model, color, and year.
[[User:71.110.195.21|71.110.195.21]] 19:26, 1 May 2006 (UTC) Randall - whizman.com - 2006/05/01

== Example 3 ==

I think that it wasn't explained in any page so far the curly braces in double-quoted strings notation for using variables... It's very confusing if you don't know it yet. They should be either replaced for . concatenating, or an explanation of how they work should be added below the example.  - ''[[User:Roma emu|Roma emu]] 15:41, 7 September 2006 (UTC)''

== Example #3 HTML rendering ==

The third example

&lt;source lang=PHP&gt;
&lt;?php
 echo &quot;Manufacturer: {$array['name']} \n&quot;;
 echo &quot;Brand: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{$array2['1']}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&quot;;
 echo &quot;Colour: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&quot;.$array3['colour'].&quot;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&quot;;
 echo &quot;Year Manufactured: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&quot;.$array3[1].&quot;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&quot;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

is output in both Google Chrome 39.0.2171.99 m (64-bit) &amp; Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.0.9600.17498 (64-bit) as

&lt;pre&gt;
Manufacturer: Toyota Brand: &lt;b&gt;Celica&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Colour: &lt;b&gt;black&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Year Manufactured: &lt;b&gt;1991&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

In other words, the commands between the ampercent and the semicolon is not executed, like it is the case for the carriage return. If these commands are converted to text,

&lt;source lang=PHP&gt;
&lt;?php
 echo &quot;Manufacturer:  {$array['name']} &lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
 echo &quot;Brand: &lt;b&gt;{$array2['1']}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
 echo &quot;Colour: &lt;b&gt;&quot; . $array3['colour'] . &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
 echo &quot;Year Manufactured: &lt;b&gt;&quot; . $array3[1] . &quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

it works in these browsers properly. The same is true for the multidimensional array example.--[[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]] ([[User talk:Sae1962|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sae1962|contribs]]) 13:44, 21 January 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About ProLaw ==
ProLaw is a case law management and Accounting software package designed for [[WikiPedia:Law Firm|law firms]]... but also quite usable by [[WikiPedia:Government agency|government agencies]]! ProLaw stores [[WikiPedia:Data|data]] in a [[WikiPedia:Microsoft SQL Server|Microsoft SQL Server]] [[WikiPedia:Database|database]] and is a [http://www.thomsonelite.com Thomson Elite] product.

The latest version (v11) is quite stable and is used by a majority of ProLaw firms.  There are still firms running v9 and even v7, which are versions that were released over a dozen years ago.

ProLaw is also very customizable.  Although it doesn't have an API--and having worked at ProLaw/Thomson-Elite for 8 years, the word was always that they would never create an API--ProLaw allows a wide variety of automation and customization.  Examples of [http://www.streamline-corp.com/ProLaw_Automation.html ProLaw automation] and [http://www.streamline-corp.com/ProLaw_Tools.html ProLaw tools] demonstrate the types of ProLaw automation and ProLaw customization possible.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Oracleoftruth. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Oracleoftruth~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This classic study is an excellent illustration of the fact that the King can take many alternative routes to the same square, each of which use the same amount of tempi. By moving to the center of the board while still chasing the Black pawn, White is able to create a promotion threat of his own. If Black ignores this threat, both pawns will queen and the ending will be drawn, but if Black spends moves with his king to stop the white c-pawn, White's king will be able to catch the h-pawn.

Building a pen can be easier than you think.  You will need to know what type of chicken you are getting before you begin construction.

If your chickens are going to be larger, heavier, and less prone to flying away (like mine) then a simple post and wire design will work.  However, most chickens are more airborne and you will need to design a pen with really high fences (if not with a wired roof) or get used to seeing your chickens on your roof.

No matter what design you choose, you will need to customize based on chicken type, local by-laws, and geography.  Before proceeding, it is recommended that you check with your municipality to see how many chickens you may keep.  In rural counties you will probably find that keeping livestock (including chickens) is OK.  However, in more urban areas there may even be TOTAL restrictions on chickens.  It should be noted that as recently as the 1960s people have been allowed to keep reasonable numbers of chickens in urban areas.

== Choosing an Area ==
A very important factor in choosing an area to raise chickens should not be overlooked. There are many predators out there who want to get to the chickens as an easy meal. You might come out one morning and your chicken have been scavenged by night predators who enjoyed a big feast. This can be devastating. Therefore it is imperative that they are locked in at night. Predators also can come during the day. For example Hawks like to snatch chickens. And they can shoot down from the sky very fast. You need to make sure you have a tight mesh on top of the roaming area, where they are fenced in. I have seen large mirrors placed in the roaming area too, which serve to distract the predators very well.

== Post and Wire Design ==
A post and wire design is the simplest way of building a pen. Just as the name suggests, all you need are some fence posts, the right kind of wire, fence staples, and appropriate tools (a regular hammer, sledgehammer, crowbar, and wire cutters will do). Do a simple survey of the area you want your chickens to live in, measuring the distance on all your fence lines. Anyone using a fence pounder should replace the next few steps with ones for a fence pounder as appropriate. 

Once your survey is complete, it is time to buy your materials. Fence posts can be purchased from a variety of lumber stores. You may find that you can only order them in large bundles as the primary consumers of fence posts are farmers who need a lot of them. If this is the case, don't worry; you will find that fence posts are incredibly useful for many purposes including support beams for storage sheds and the chicken house.

Although you could use chicken wire for containing your chickens, I recommend stucco wire. Stucco wire is usually used for holding stucco to the sides of buildings. It is stronger and taller than chicken wire. You will also need fence staples for attaching the wire to the posts. These can be found at most hardware stores. If you can't find actual fencing staples, then staples used for attaching electrical wire to walls will do. I must stress that you shouldn't skimp on your staples. You will need a lot, even if you have a small pen. Not only do you need lots during construction, you will need a supply for emergency repairs.

Now that you have your fence materials, you will need tools for building the fence. You will need a regular hammer for the staples, a crowbar for making holes for the posts, and a sledgehammer for pounding the posts in.

When selecting a sledgehammer you should keep the weight in mind. It should be heavy enough so that you are doing less of the work for pounding the post in and more is done by the hammer. However, if it weighs too much, and you have trouble lifting it, then you might not be able to pound as efficiently as with a hammer that has a more comfortable weight. A crowbar is needed to dig a hole to start the post. You should select a pole that comes to a point at the end. Now we have all the materials and tools needed; let’s get to the actual construction.

=== Construction ===
Building the pen is very simple to do. There are, however, some tricks that aren’t obvious that are only learned from experience. Some hidden tricks that are specific to chickens (cattle don't need these on fences to contain them) will be covered here.


If the ground is dry or frozen you should bring a bucket of water along to soften the ground. Use the pointed end of your crowbar to pound a hole in the ground. When a hole starts to form, pour water into it occasionally to soften the soil. You should also leave your crowbar in the hole and use it to widen the hole by pulling you body weight against it. A 20 cm deep hole should be sufficient. The hole should be wide enough to hold a post. When you have finished making your hole, put your post, pointed end first, into the hole. Use your sledgehammer to pound the post into the ground until it is firm. On days when the soil is dry, having the post a little loose might work as the soil will slowly soften around it. To stabilize the post and allow the energy of your pounding to be used more effectively, it may be useful to have someone on the side opposite yours to hold the post while you pound. Be CAREFUL as, if you miss the post, you could injure your assistant.  Space your posts about a meter apart.  You should add two posts that are about a wheelbarrow width apart.  This will be your gate later.

Once you have enough posts to put a fence around the area you choose to build your pen at, you can put wire up around it.   To do this bring your stucco wire to a corner post.  You should probably have more than one person do this as stuco wire is heavy.  Hold the end of the wire to the post and hammer in with fence staples.  Once your end is secured unroll your wire to the next post in line.  Don't wrap your wire around this one.  Instead unroll the the wire a little beyond the post and staple what wire touches the post.  Continue doing this until either the pen is complete or you run out of wire.  If you run out of wire then you can continue on with another roll.  If the first roll ran out just after a post then wrap it around the post as best you can and move on.  Do not wrap the second wire around this post instead have it share the last post of the roll that ran out.  Once that is done then continue in the same way as before.

If the wire runs out before reaching a post then you should probably pound a new post in so that the end of the wire can be attached.  Then continue with the next roll sharing this new post.

To make a gate all you need is some particle board, hinges and a latch.

Cut the particle board to fit between the gate posts, and attach the hardware appropriately.  Get a heavy-duty latch and lock for your gate.  Animals are not the only predators that may helps themselves to your birds or their eggs.

It is also possible to raise free range chickens.  If you do that, you might want to mix in 
with the regular birds several Guinea hens.  They are not that large a bird and are not that good a 
meat producer or egg producer, but are good 'watch dogs' for the flock.  The bugs and greens the 
free ranging birds get make very good eggs and meat.   Guinea hens are good collectors of bugs. Free
ranging birds also need protection at night.

Hint: The only piece that white moves is the queen, and the first 13 moves are all checks.

I have 9 laying Rhode Island Red Hens
Up till now I've been feeding them on layena and scratch with the occasional other scraps, greens etc.  I have been told that layena is not all that good for them,that I would be better off to feed them more vegetable scraps instead.

Maybe you could comment.

I used to work as a meatcutter, if you want some info about cutting them into sections or whatever I can type something up.  But sorry I'm not graphically talented enough to do clean diagrams.  --[[User:Andymussell|Andymussell]] 01:59, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

That would be great.  Diagrams are not nesesry if you have trouble creating them.  We need something to cover this and if we choose to add them, diagrams can always be added later.

I have just created a [[Raising_Chickens/Death/Butchering|section]] for this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note that all of Black's moves are forced:
*Black king cannot escape on a7 because of the white b6 pawn;
*Black queen cannot parry an a-file check on a7 because it would actually be a suicide;
*Black king cannot escape on c8 because the white queen is checking at either f4, g3 or h2 when Black king is on b8.  As such if escaping to c8,  Qf8/Q(x)g8/Qh8 will checkmate the black king next move.  Note that c7 and d7 are both guarded by white pawns.

A '''crank puller''' is a tool for removing cranks from the bottom bracket spindle.  There are two main types of cranks: square taper and spline drive.  Most modern bicycles have moved to spline drive and away from the square taper design.  One crank puller will not pull both styles of cranks unless it includes an interchangeable accessory for this purpose.

==Identify bottom bracket type==

[[Image:br_cupconebb.jpg|thumb|left|Cup and cone BB showing lockring and adjustable cup.]] [[Image:br_cartridgebb.jpg|thumb|right|Cartridge BB showing splined cup.]]

There are two main bottom bracket types. More common on older bikes is the cup and cone style shown to the left. On modern bikes the most common is the sealed cartridge bearing shown to the right. The easiest way to identify which you have is to look at the bottom bracket on the non-drive side of the bike. A cup and cone bottom bracket will have a lockring and adjustable cup. A cartridge will just have a cup with a splined interface.

''For a detailed analysis of the varying types of bottom bracket see the [[Wikipedia:Bottom bracket|Wikipedia article]].''

==Cartridge==

A cartridge bottom bracket is a sealed unit and once worn out the whole thing is replaced.

'''Cartridge bottom bracket replacement:'''
# Remove both crank arms
#Use a [[../../Tools and Supplies/Bottom bracket tool|bottom bracket tool]] to remove old unit. Remember most modern bikes use English threads so the drive side cup will be reverse threaded and unscrews clockwise.
# Clean bottom bracket threads in frame with degreaser and rag.
# Apply grease to the frame threads and bottom bracket threads.
# Insert the bottom bracket into the frame. Make sure it is oriented correctly, left and right should be marked on the shell. Typically the drive side cup will be fixed to the shell and have a raised flange. Take care when threading the bottom bracket into the frame, it is easy to cross thread.  If the cup has a raised flange tighten until the flange is tight against the frame.
# Fit the other cup again taking care to avoid cross threading. Tighten until it is tight against the shell.
# Reinstall cranks.

==Cup and cone==

Remove the lock ring of the adjustable (left side) cup.  There are several ways to do this, the best of which is to use a large Sugino or Campagnolo (or equivalent) lockring spanner, which looks like a curved finger that fits around the lockring with a hangnail that goes into the lockring slot.  In a pinch, an adjustable pin spanner can also be used to grip the lock ring.  The direction to turn depends upon the style of adjustable cup; English/French, Italian, or Swiss.

There are a few types of adjustable cup:
One type has holes in it designed for a pin spanner to unscrew.  This tool looks like a giant pair of tweezers with one pin on each tang.  A picture of this can be seen here http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tooltips/images/bbtools5.jpg
The other type looks like an adjustable spanner would fit, but in practice a chisel and a mallet is often the only way to turn it round and out.

Once the left cup is out, remove the ball bearings (usually in a retainer) and the bottom bracket spindle, and then the right side bearings. Note which way the retainer comes out and be sure to replace it the same way round. It is not necessary to remove the fixed cup over on the right hand side, and because of the difficulty and chance of damaging the fixed cup flats, removal is not recommended if you want to keep it.

Clean all bearing surfaces using a penetrating solvent to dissolve congealed grease.  Inspect for pits and discard and replace any pitted cups or a pitted spindle.  Remove individual balls from the retainer and clean thoroughly before replacing them.

Grease the cups and bearings liberally using a good quality commercial grease made for this purpose.  Use copper grease ONLY on the screw-threads and reinstall the right side bearings and bottom bracket spindle.  If the spindle is asymmetric be sure to orient the longer side of the spindle on the right (drive side) of the bike.  Place left side bearings into the cup and gently screw the cup back onto the frame. Take your time and use only your fingers until you're certain that it is not cross-threaded.  Do not force it!  It is easy to strip or foul the bottom bracket threads by mistake. Continue screwing with the pin tool (or adjustable spanner) once the cup gets deep into the bottom bracket shell.

When the bottom bracket feels tight, check for play by grasping the spindle and yanking in and out on the spindle and listening / feeling for play.  It is better to be a little bit too tight than too loose.  When the lockring is secure the play will increase ever so slightly.  When all the play is removed, thread on the lockring and tighten with lockring spanner (here, a pin spanner cannot provide enough force to secure the lockring permanently.)  Tighten the lockring until it can go no further.

== Symptoms of a bottom bracket needing overhaul ==

''Listen'' to your bike, and take notice of what it ''feels'' like, when you are riding.  Through your feet, via the pedals, you can diagnose many power-drive-related problems, including whether the bottom bracket is in need of maintenance.

If you can hear or feel a periodic (i.e. once per crank revolution) creak or ticking noise when the system is under high or even normal load, it could be time to regrease or replace the bottom bracket.  The creak, click, or rough feeling usually occurs as the crank arms pass through one particular point in their cycle; if it does, then you have a problem with either the bottom bracket or possibly the pedals themselves (check this latter simply by spinning the pedals with your hand; they should spin freely).  The creaking in the bottom bracket can be caused by the on-set of corrosion (due to frequent exposure of this part of the bike to water and dirt).

For total confirmation of a worn bottom bracket, remove the crank arms and spin the spindle by hand; you will quickly be able to tell if it is in need of maintenance or replacement.
==Beware of damaging the threads in the frame==
Great care and cleanliness is necessary to protect the thread of the bottom bracket in the frame. This is the only part of the whole bicycle that is vulnerable to &quot;wearing out&quot;, sometimes by running in a loosened condition. Or, perhaps more commonly, be damaged beyond repair by carelessness (eg cross-threading) in the workshop. The common practice of tightening the locking ring with a hammer and chisel will damage the ring (no great problem, it is replaceable) but is also ineffective in providing sufficient torque.

'''Load the modules''' means to put a piece code in the '''templates''' ''index.php'' file that will be replaced with the modules when run through mambo's template engine. There are some parameters that you can use when loading these modules that load them in different ways. 

In this article, all code examples are for the &quot;left&quot; module position. This can be replaced with any position you want.

There are many ways (''plain, tableless, wrapped'') to load the modules in mambo. 

==The normal, plain mode==

This is the most common way to do it, and has no additional parameters, and will load the module in a table. This is how it should look:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'left' ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

This loads a table with the class &quot;moduletable&quot;. The module header, if present, is loaded in a th-cell, whilst the content of the module is loaded in a td-cell. 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! valign=&quot;top&quot; | Module heading
|-
| Module content
|}


==Without the &quot;moduletable&quot;-table==

This method echoes the modules content only, without the moduletable-table. This means that the header will be gone too, as the whole table that wraps around the content in the normal, plain mode is gone.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'left',-2 ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

This is the output it produces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;moduletable&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Module Heading&lt;/h3&gt;
MODULE CONTENT	
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Wrapped in div-tags==

This method is identical to the previous one, but wraps it in three addidional div tags. With the right css code applied to it, it is possible to create graphical modules that are dynamic in width and height.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules ( 'left',-3 ); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Main Menu&lt;/h3&gt;
MODULE CONTENT
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

This article/essay is an introduction written for a total beginner that has no experience with CMS systems at all. You should have some skills in web sites, however, to fully understand this article.

It is recommended to read the article from top to bottom.

==What is mambo?==

Mambo is a content management system, which, as the phrase suggests, manages content. Mambo manages the text, images, links, documents and interaction - the main elements of every website. This means that instead of using an application like Dreamweaver, FrontPage or a similar visual website management tool, you use Mambo to maintain and update a site. Mambo utilizes a browser based system to do this - the administration is a securely accessed back end of the website. You log in, and use the browser to add content, publish articles, approve submissions and perform countless other functions involved in maintaining an active growing website.

==How does mambo work?==

Mambo is based on three elements: a web server, a script language and a database. The webserver is connected to the internet and makes the site available there, the script language consists of the programs and functions, and the database stores the content.

First, a user requests the mambo page by entering the URL. The browser then connects to the webserver. The URL contains the parameters of the content - what section, which article and so on. Based on those parameters, mambo's script system contacts the database and gets the content. Then, the content and the template are merged together, and this returns as a plain HTML and CSS page.

==Those terms..==

Mambo has many special [[Mambo Open Source/Terms|words and phrases]] that a beginner might not understand. They are used very often in the community and may not be self-explanatory, so knowing what these words mean can be very useful for a beginner.

===[[../Components/]]===
The Components are supplements and additions to mambo's core functions. Mambo can publish text, upload images, manage users, etc., but Components provide additional functionality that can perform specialized tasks. Examples include: download managers, forums, commerce, galleries, guestbooks, wikis, newsletters - the list is almost endless.

These components are installed with an installer in Mambo, found under &quot;components &gt; install/uninstall&quot; in the Mambo Administration panel. This is how most of the Components are installed, but it should be noted that some of them will need modification to core files. However, that is very seldom needed, as the components installer is usually sufficient.

===[[../Modules/]]===
Modules are the side blocks in mambo. Among these are the ''main menu module, login, poll, syndicate'' - all the stuff around the content.
Mambo has predefined positions for these Modules. The most common are the left and right positions. The designer of a template (see below) can place these positions wherever he/she wants, so there is no rule that says the left position will be on the left of the template. But templates are commonly set up so that this corresponds to the actual layout.

There are also more Module positions. There are top positions, which are usually over both left and right modules, and also content. This position is good for newsflashes etc. There are many more positions to choose from, and one can create as many as one likes - you can have 30 different positions if you want to.

===[[../Templates/]]===
The Templates are exactly the same as a skin. The Templates are predefined looks, which make mambo look a certain way. The Templates do not control the behavior, though, as in other systems that use Templates - it is a look-only definition.

Explained very simply, a Template is a HTML/CSS document that has code in it which makes it compatible with Mambo. For example, they contain is code for loading the modules of a certain position, code for loading the main body (main content) and so on.

===[[../Mambots/]]===
The Mambots are small scripts that act upon the elements within Mambo. This can be any elements - components, content and all other aspects of the site.

There are many forms of Mambots. The most frequent are content Mambots. These are used like this: you insert {mambot_name} into some content, and the Mambot replaces this tag with the functions of the Mambot. This can be embedding Flash, linking to other content, inserting images etc.</text>

* Subset of [[w:First_order_logic|First Order Logic]] 
* restricted to [[w:Horn_clause|Horn Clauses]] 
* [[w:Inference|Inference]] by [[w:First-order_resolution|resolution theorem]] proving 
* [[w:Unification|Unification]]
* [[w:Depth-First Search|Depth-First-Search]]
* [[w:Backward_chaining|Backward-Chaining Approach]]

=== Inner workings === 
[[w:First-order_resolution|Resolution]] is [[w:Recursively_enumerable_set|semi-decidable]] for
[[w:First_order_logic|First Order Logic]]:
 KB = P(f(x)) -&gt; P(x)
 &lt;=&gt; ~P(f(x) v P(x)
and let's say we're trying to prove P(a). Resolution refutation assumes the negated goal - ~P(a) and from ~P(f(x)) v P(x) we can derive P(f(a)) by substituting &quot;a&quot; for &quot;x&quot;. But then we can go on and resolve again to get P(f(f(a))) etc. 
Does this contradict the claim that resolution refutation is complete? NO - because completeness states that any sentence ''Q'' that can be derived by resolution from a set of premises ''P'' must be entailed by ''P''. If it is not entailed by ''P'', then we might no be able to proof that!

Propositional calculus is decidable.

Horn Clause = clause with at most one positive literal (in Prolog: &quot;q :- p_1, p_2, ... , p_n&quot; stands for the Horn Clause &quot;q v ~p_1 v ~p_2 v ... v ~p_n&quot;.

Prolog syntax is based on Horn clauses, which have the form of &quot;p_1,p_2,...,p_n -&gt; q&quot;. In Prolog, this is mapped to an &quot;if-then&quot;-clause:
 q :- p_1,p_2,...,p_n 
(i.e. &quot;q, if p_1 and p_2 and ... and p_n)

This can be viewed as a procedure: 
# A goal literal matches (unifies) with q; 
# The tail of the clause &quot;p_1 ... p_n&quot; is instantiated with the substitution of values for variables (unifiers) derived from this match; 
# The instantiated clauses serve as subgoals that invoke other procedures and so on.

Theorem-proving method of Prolog is resolution refutation (assume the negated hypothesis and try to resolve the empty clause) - if you succeed, then it's safe to assert the hypothesis, otherwise not. Resolution simply works on contradictory literals (e.g. {~p,q},{p} stands for &quot;if socrates is a man (p) then he is mortal (q)&quot; in CNF (p implies q is equivalent to ~p or q); now if we assume that socrates is indeed a man, then by resolution, this implies q).

If we have a goal q, then it might make sense to assert the negated goal for resolution refutation, which is essentially proof by reductio. This is a form of backward reasoning with sub-goaling: we assert the negated goal and try to work backwards, unifying and resolving clauses until we get
to the empty clause, which allows us to claim that the theory implies our original hypothesis (by reductio).

=== Outline ===
&lt;pre&gt;
 Input = Query Q and a Logic Program P;
 Output = &quot;yes&quot; if Q follows from P, &quot;no&quot; otherwise;
 
     Initialize current goal set to {Q}
     While(the current goal set is not empty) do
 
         Choose a G from the current goal set (first)
         Look for a suitable rule in the knowledge-base;
         unify any variable if necessary to match rule;
             G :- B1, B2, B3, ...
         If (no such rule exists) EXIT
         Else Replace G with B1, B2, B3... 
 
     If (current goal set is empty)
         return NO.
     Else
         return YES. (plus all unifications of variables)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Cuts ===
Cuts (!) in Prolog are NOT sound!

Prolog itself (even if not considering the &quot;failure by negation&quot; (\+) and the cut is NOT complete.

Prolog uses Linear Input Resolution (resolve axiom and goal, then axiom and newly resolved subgoal, etc. and ''never'' resolve two axioms).

== Algorithms in LISP == 
CDR yields rest of the list, CAR yields head of the list. Lisp programs are S-expressions containing
S-expressions. So basically, a LISP program is a linked list processing linked lists.

== Factorial ==
&lt;pre&gt;
Prolog:
 factorial(1,1).
 factorial(N,Result) :- NewN is N-1,
               factorial(NewN,NewResult),
               Result is N * NewResult.

Tail recursion:
 factorial(N,Result) :- fact_iter(N,Result,1,1).
 fact_iter(N,Result,N,Result) :- !.
 fact_iter(N,Result,I,Temp) :- I &lt; N,
                               NewI is I+1,
                               NewTemp is Temp * NewI,
                               fact_iter(N,Result,NewI,NewTemp).

Lisp:
 (defun factorial (n)
     (cond
         ((&lt;= n 1) 1)
     (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

Tail recursion:
 (defun fact_tail (n)
     (fact_iter 1 1 n))
 
 (defun fact_iter (result counter max)
     (cond
         ((&gt; counter max) result)
         (T (fact_iter (* result counter) (+1 counter) max))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Fibonacci ==
&lt;pre&gt;
Prolog:
 fib(1,1). fib(2,1).
 
 fib(N,Result) :- N &gt; 2,
          N1 is N-1,
          N2 is N-2,
          fib(N1,F1),
          fib(N2,F2),
          Result is F1 + F2.

Tail recursion:
 fibo(N,Result) :- fib_iter(N,Result,1,0,1).
 
 fib_iter(N,Result,N,_,Result) :- !.
 
 fib_iter(N,Result,I,F1,F2) :- I &lt; N,
                   NewI is I+1,
                   NewF1 is F2,
                   NewF2 is F1+F2,
                   fib_iter(N,Result,NewI,NewF1,NewF2).

Lisp:
 (defun fib (n)
     (cond
         ((&lt;= n 2) 1)
     (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))) 

Tail recursion: 
 (defun fib-tail (n)
     (fib_iter 1 1 0 1 n)) 
 
 (defun fib-iter (result counter f1 f2 max)
     (cond
         ((&gt; counter max) result)
         (T (fib-iter (+ f1 f2)
                      (+1 counter)
                      f2
                      (+ f1 f2)
                      max)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Recursion ==

=== Standard Recursion ===

Program calls itself recursively from within the program. Uses a stack to store intermediate states that &quot;wait&quot; for a result from a lower level. The recursion goes down to a stopping condition, which returns a definite result that is passed on to the next higher level until we reach the top level again. The final result is computed along the way.

=== Tail Recursion ===
In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last call in the program. This allows us to build up the result while we're going down in the recursion until we hit the bottom level; along the way, we compute the final result, such that it is available once we reach the stopping condition. &quot;Smart&quot; compilers recognize tail recursion and stop the program once we hit the bottom - but some compilers &quot;bubble&quot; the result up to the top level before returning it.

== Other Examples ==
&lt;pre&gt;
Flatten
 (defun flatten (thelist)
        (if
          ((null thelist) nil)
          ((atom thelist) (list thelist))
          (t (append (flatten (car thelist)))
          (flatten (cdr thelist)))))

REVERSE
 (defun myrev (thelist)
        (if
          ((null thelist) nil)
        (append (myrev (cdr thelist)) (list (car thelist)) 

DELETE ELEMENT (Prolog)
 del(X,[X|Tail],Tail).
 del(X,[Y|Tail],[Y|Tail1]) :- del(X,Tail,Tail1).

FLATTEN (Prolog)
 flat([],[]). flat([Head|Tail],Result) :- is_list(Head),
                             flat(Head,FlatHead),
                             flat(Tail,FlatTail),
                             append(FlatHead,FlatTail,Result).
 
 flat([Head|Tail],[Head|FlatTail]) :- \+(is_list(Head)),
                                      flat(Tail,FlatTail).

Union set
 union([],Set,Set).
  
 union([Head|Tail],Set,Union) :- member(Head,Set),
                                 union(Tail,Set,Union).
 
 union([Head|Tail],Set,[Head|Union]) :- \+(member(Head,Set)),
                                        union(Tail,Set,Union).
&lt;/pre&gt;

I am suggesting that the verb &quot;ir&quot; be taken out of the irregular past participle conjugation because &quot;ido&quot; is in fact created by dropping the infinitive ending (&quot;ir&quot; in this case), and adding &quot;ido.&quot;</text>

==Case Sensitivity==
JavaScript is case-sensitive. This means that &lt;code&gt;Hello()&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as &lt;code&gt;HELLO()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;hello()&lt;/code&gt;

==Whitespace==
Whitespace can be: extra indents, line breaks, and spaces. JavaScript ignores it, but it makes the code easier for people to read.

The following is JavaScript with very little whitespace.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
function filterEmailKeys(event){
event=event||window.event;
var charCode=event.charCode||event.keyCode;
var char=String.fromCharCode(charCode);
if(/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.@]/.exec(char))
return true;
return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is the same JavaScript with a typical amount of whitespace.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
function filterEmailKeys(event) {
  event = event || window.event;
  var charCode = event.charCode || event.keyCode;
  var char = String.fromCharCode(charCode);
  if (/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.@]/.exec(char)) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is the same JavaScript with a lot of whitespace.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
function filterEmailKeys( evt )
  {
    evt = evt || window.event;

    var charCode = evt.charCode || evt.keyCode;
    var char = String.fromCharCode ( charCode );

    if ( /[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.@]/.exec ( char ) )
      {
        return true;
      }

    return false;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comments==
Comments allow you to leave notes in your code to help other people understand it. They also allow you to comment out code that you want to hide from the parser, but you don't want to delete.

'''Single-line comments'''

A double slash, &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;, turns all of the following text on the same line into a comment that will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
// Shows a welcome message
alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Multi-line comments'''

Multi-line comments are begun with slash asterisk, &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt;, and end with the reverse asterisk slash, &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;.

Here is an example of how to use the different types of commenting techniques.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
/* This is a multi-line comment
that contains multiple lines
of commented text. */
var a = 1;
/* commented out to perform further testing
a = a + 2;
a = a / (a - 3); // is something wrong here?
*/
alert('a: ' + a);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Semicolons==
In many computer languages, semicolons are required at the end of each code statement. In JavaScript the use of semicolons is optional, as a new line indicates the end of the statement. This is called ''automatic semicolon insertion'', and the rules for it are quite complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf Standard ECMA-262]
 ECMAScript Language Specification, Chapter 7.9 - Automatic Semicolon Insertion&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving out semicolons and allowing the parser to automatically insert them can create complex problems.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
a = b + c
(d + e).print()
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code is not interpreted as two statements. Because of the parentheses on the second line, JavaScript interprets the above as if it were

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
a = b + c(d + e).print();
&lt;/source&gt;

when instead, you may have meant it to be interpreted as

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
a = b + c;
(d + e).print();
&lt;/source&gt;

Even though semicolons are optional, it's preferable to end statements with a semicolon to prevent any misunderstandings from taking place.

==Literals==
A literal is a hard coded value. Literals provide a means of expressing specific values in your script. For example, at the right of equal:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=JavaScript&gt;var myLiteral = &quot;a fixed value&quot;;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

There are several types of literals available. The most common are the string literals, but there are also integer and floating-point literals, array and boolean literals, and object literals.

Example of an object literal:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=JavaScript&gt;var myObject = { name:&quot;value&quot;, anotherName:&quot;anotherValue&quot;};&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Details of these different types are covered in [[JavaScript/Variables and Types|Variables and Types]].

==Identifiers==
An identifier is a name for a piece of data such as a variable, array, or function. There are rules:
* Letters, dollar signs, underscores, and numbers are allowed in identifiers.
* The first character cannot be a number.

Examples of valid identifiers:
*&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;$hello&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;_Hello&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;hello90&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;1A2B3C&lt;/code&gt; is an invalid identifier, as it starts with a number.

=== Naming variables ===
When naming variables there are some rules that must be obeyed:

* Upper case and lower case letters of the alphabet, underscores, and dollar signs can be used
* Numbers are allowed after the first character
* No other characters are allowed
* Variable names are case sensitive: different case implies a different name
* A variable may not be a reserved word

Bookmarklets are one line scripts stored in the URL field of a bookmark. Bookmarklets have been around for a  long time so they will work in older browsers.

==JavaScript URI scheme==
You should be familiar with URL that start with schemes like &lt;tt&gt;http&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ftp&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. There is also the &lt;tt&gt;JavaScript&lt;/tt&gt; scheme, which is used to start every bookmarklet.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
JavaScript:alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Using multiple lines of code==
Since you cannot have line breaks in bookmarklets you must use a semicolon at the end of each code statement instead.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
JavaScript:name=prompt(&quot;What is your name?&quot;)&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;;&lt;/font&gt;alert(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
&lt;/source&gt;

==The &lt;tt&gt;JavaScript&lt;/tt&gt; Protocol in Links==
The &lt;tt&gt;JavaScript&lt;/tt&gt; protocol can be used in links. This may be considered bad practice, as it prevents access for or confuses users who have disabled JavaScript. See [[../Best Practices/]].

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;JavaScript:document.bgColor='#0000FF'&quot;&gt;blue background&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Examples==
A large quantity of links may be found on [http://www.bookmarklets.com/ bookmarklets.com], which show a variety of features that can be performed within JavaScript. &lt;!-- I disagree with promoting a given link, as it looks like advertising for this site. However, it appears to be at least an example that can be used, and as such, I'm converting it from an &quot;External link&quot; to an &quot;example:. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Selecting a Theme==
'''Add your suggestions about how to go about selecting a theme for your novel.'''

It can be anything that really grips your imagination and which you would like to write about. Preferably it should be something you have a fair amount of idea about, because that will save you a lot of research.

At times an idea for a theme would strike you - jot it down. You may not have the time to build upon it just then, but do write down what ever you have thought at that time, for later reference. It may be worthwhile maintaining a notebook or journal for this purpose.

David Langford once wrote that there is no worse advice for a writer of fiction than &quot;write about what you know&quot;, because it leads to sterile attempts to recreate one's own experience. Do not be afraid to write about something rare and exceptional and different from your own life either. (Keeping in mind, however, that the emotions still have to feel real, the novel still has to ring true.) Especially now, when information on almost any topic is freely available via the Internet, there is no excuse for fiction writers not to reach out to subjects which they have very little experience with.

But no matter what it is that you want to write about, the thing to do is to GET STARTED. The idea is not to wait for the whole story to crystallize, and not to keep procrastinating; pick up your pen (or get down to your keyboard) and start - that is the only way to get it done.

When choosing a theme, make sure you are writing about a subject you find interesting. One of the best ways to make writing a tedious effort is to write about a subject that you do not care about.

Furthermore, sometimes your best ideas come through your subconscious. When you awake, you may want to write down the major feeling, or what you saw or did; this may be a whole story in itself, or perhaps the missing piece to your character.

When thinking about a theme for your story, be sure not to confuse it with the conflict, as they are two very different things. Conflict is what drives the events of the story, whereas theme is the overall idea or emotion that ties it all together and makes it human. For example, imagine you are writing a crime story, and the conflict occurs when the hero comes home to find a note saying that his daughter has been kidnapped by an escaped convict.  Possible themes for such a story could be good verses evil, the strength of the human spirit, or the unbreakable bond between parent and child. If you do not have an idea for a theme before you start a novel do not worry - you will discover it as you go along, because these things develop naturally.

==Research==
It is very important for a novel to be well researched, irrespective of what the subject or topic is. It makes the story more interesting and authentic. Remember Arthur Hailey or Dan Brown? The research that goes into each of their books is what makes them all the more interesting.

Research can help you add detail and texture to your story that might otherwise be lacking. For stories that you invent spells (fantasy), research into existing methods of magic can help you come up with ceremonies that you might well be able to adapt, adding a colorful touch to your fiction.

It also help in adding small little touches to your novel that make it more interesting to read. For instance, if you know that there is one particular bird who can only sing one note, you could use this as interesting foreshadowing.

In example:

As Charley reached for the door, he heard a solitary chirp.
&quot;A C-sharp,&quot; he murmured...

==Creating an Outline==
'''Should you first create an outline of your novel, or is it better to start off and then build it up as ideas come along? Or a mix of both?'''

I feel it is always better to start off with a broad blueprint or outline of your story. You can build it up and modify it as the story develops.

It is good to have a broad idea of how you want your story to go, but in the initial writing process it is good to have a lot of flexibility to fiddle around with things as well.

Everyone writes differently: some swear by outlines and others swear at them. It is up to you to figure out which kind of writer you are. However, if this is your first novel, you are far more likely to finish it if you have something written down beforehand, something that will show you where to go when you get stuck (which you will).  At the very least, know how the story is going to end before you begin. It may change along the way, but at least you will have a direction to head in and a goal to aim for.

A very good thing to do once you have a basic idea in mind is to carry a small (or big - if it is convenient) notebook around, and keep noting down any ideas that strike you. Ideas have this annoying habit of striking you at the most annoying of moments, just when you are not prepared for them. Remember Archimedes?

Some people, however, will begin a written work with very little knowledge of what is to come. Many of these people will write until something coherent comes out, then go back and make the rest of the story fit.  This is especially true of many people who participate in [http://www.nanowrimo.org National Novel Writing Month].

==Creating your Characters==
'''How do you decide the personalities of characters in your novel? A suggested method is to base them on real people you know (without offending them). Another idea along those lines is to take characteristics of some friends (or enemies) and take them to the extreme. Breathe life into your characters and make them think on their own. Once your characters are living breathing creatures, the plot should fall around them.'''

Take characteristics of yourself, or the opposite characteristics of yourself, and spread them through many characters. Experiment: give your female characters characteristics of male friends, and vice versa.

Another way to build up your characters is to ''keep your eyes and ears open''. Look around you, especially in public places such as airports. Observe the people around you: how they behave - the way they scold their children, the way the wife is obviously annoyed at her husband. You will learn a lot of nuances which you can include. As discussed earlier, it may be a good idea to keep a notebook and pen handy to note down whatever strikes you. And the best part is that the whole exercise would take away the monotony of waiting for the flight.

The way people dress is often reflective of their attitude. A lot of good authors use this technique of describing a person's clothes and thereby reflecting their characters' personality. Try this: notice people in a public place, and try to describe their clothes; try linking this with the way you picture their personality.

Naming your characters is another very important aspect. Here is an excellent article regarding naming characters.
http://www.fictionfactor.com/guests/name.html

==Developing Your Style==
Without the motive of plagiarising, you must study your favourite authors carefully and pick up ideas about their style of writing and modify the same to suit yours; how can you create a piece of artwork without appreciating art other artist's work within the genre. Some writers like describing every single thing; for example, the type of wood the table is made of, the smells at the country [?county] fair, or the deep blue-green scales of the invading dragon. Some people keep details sparse and include only things necessary to get the plot moving along.

Another important literacy style is the use of third or first person. Find out what sort of style you like writing best, and be sure to stick with it. Unless there is some specific reason for writing different parts of your novel in a different style, your readers are going to be very confused when you give a rich first person view detailed chapter and suddenly switch to a whole other writing style entirely. I strongly urge consistency.

==Editing==
'''Get feedback. Correct errors. Cut parts out. Perfect it!'''

Lets face it: nobody can write a perfect first draft. Sooner or later you are going to have to edit it for little things like grammatical errors, to big plot holes. The first draft will be very basic, but once it is written you can add more detail and fix most errors; do not worry about fixing grammar or punctuation errors until a later draft, as the story is much more important at this stage; furthermore, editing too much errors in your first draft will be messy and confusing. For later drafts, perhaps third, fourth, it would be a good idea to have someone else look at it. Reading it yourself over and over again is helpful but even then you just do not catch something a fresh reader would. I personally leave something alone for a whole month or so, look at it and correct it, and am sure to look at it again, perhaps another month later. It helps me catch things, but it is usually best to find someone to help you. The more help you can get the better. If you have a book club you like, let them have a look at it - you know they love reading. Perhaps a teacher or mentor, or even a friend, can look at it. There are also lots of places online such as [http://www.writing.com Writing.com]. While posting your work online can help get people to look at it, it might be possible for someone to plagiarise it. Be sure to put it in a place where it is protected and be sure to add a copyright notice - it's your work. Be aware of copyright laws in your country.

Something that might be scary to deal with is plot holes. A reader might point out a little mistake your character said that could contradict something you wrote earlier on. Hopefully it will not be such a huge mistake that you will have to write half your book, but believe me, it can happen. I have rewritten over twelve chapters due to large mistakes. This is where perseverance comes in again - you just have to keep at it. Do not feel bad about making mistakes because everyone makes them. You are not a bad writer because you made a huge mistake and had to rewrite a whole chapter. Rome was not built in a day, and they surely made mistakes along the way too.

A hard lesson you may have to learn is simply letting go of things. It depends on what you are writing, but if there is something in your novel that is completely unnecessary (i.e., no character development in a particular scene, a particular scene is not very entertaining, or introduces a minor character that will confuse things later) you may need to erase it and forget about it. You might have gotten really attached to Jim and his scene at the skating rink, or you may have loved Dorothia's cute little quirk, but if you really need to let go of something, let go of it and erase. Perhaps you can put Dorothia's little quirk on another character or Jim can show up later, but the point is no matter how much you love something, if you KNOW your novel would be better off without it, take it out. I know it is hard. Before you erase big parts of your novel, however, SAVE EVERYTHING!  Especially on a computer. If you delete a 12-page scene, save it and hide it away; there may have been something there you wanted to use after all.

Even with heavy editing, you may not be pleased with the way something has come out. It is important for you to love what you have written but you also have to understand many writers or artists are never pleased with their work. This is another reason feedback is important. You might think it is the worst trash ever written but if a hundred other people think it is brilliant, you need to consider that.

==Putting it All Together==
I guess the main thing about getting it actually done is ''perseverance''. You need to put in some amount of writing time EVERYDAY, no matter how busy your schedule is. And even if you don not actually get down to writing everyday, you can at least give some thought to developing your story and/or your characters in your mind. You can do that while travelling, or even while slacking off at work.

Of course, if you are a gentleman (or lady) at large, with adequate time and resources (moolah) at  your disposal, you can take the time off and head out to the mountains or Caribbean and rent a cottage to devote time to your literary pursuits. But most of us are not as lucky - at least, not for the first novel. So the requirement of juggling time between managing a full-time job and yet finding the time and inclination to write while keeping the wife and family happy at the same time.

==Getting it Published==
'''There are hordes of aspiring writers out there, besides the well established ones.'''

Many people believe a literary agent will help with the publishing process. It can be tricky to find the one that is right for you, but agents know about the business, have contacts in the business, would know what publishers would be most receptive of your work, and generally they can get a better contract than you would be able to negotiate yourself. Many new authors do not know how much money they should get up front, how royalties work, or many other aspects of the business. Agents take care of this for you. Writer Beware: look for agents that will disclose their satisfied clients list. If they are not willing to disclose names, they could very well be a fly-by-night agency. When in doubt, check your favorite author's books for the agency they use, or check with the A.A.R. (Association of Author's Representatives.)

It should also be noted that many of the larger publishing companies have what is called an &quot;open call&quot; for unpublished authors. Many of these even accept submissions from authors without agents. Be aware, however, that most of these companies have very strict guidelines of how a manuscript should look when submitted. Check with your favorite publisher's website to see if they have an open call.

I came here to post and edit a small pamphlet for beginning contradancers tentatively titled [[Ten Stupid Things Beginners Do to Mess Up Their Contradance Experience]].  I might do some other stuff here after that in other areas of my interest, although I'm likely to do most of them on my own wiki once I get apache working again.

I'm starting work now on a document to be a [[Contradancers Guide to Successfully Beginning Scottish Country Dance]].  It's going to be somewhat messy, as, for now, I'm just generating text and don't really have a structure for the whole thing yet.</text>

== Description ==

X'Alignment is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any memory-allocated object or type. This attribute controls the [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Address|address]] values used for objects. The alignment must be non-negative. A value of zero means that the object need not be allocated at the boundary of a storage units. Otherwise the address is a multiple of X's alignment. 

The alignment of an object may be set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I started this page, but just realized I have no idea how to connect it up with the rest of the book... I'm also not sure it's in the right place on the contents list, I just put it there so it'd be somewhere.  These things shouldn't be too big a deal yet because the tutorial is far from finished anyways, but if someone could connect this page to the rest of the book, it'd be much appreciated!

In laying down the bones, what is subdivided - the cylinder or the armature? [[User:206.248.152.37|206.248.152.37]] 23:18, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

Subdivide the armature, to create more bones. Another method of creating a chain of connected bones is to Extrude ('''EKEY''') from the tip of the bone. This lets you control size and orientation immediately
--[[User:88.153.140.138|88.153.140.138]] 08:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

Umm, when I'm parenting a bone to a structure, it says: &quot;Loop in parents&quot;. Help, please!

If there's a loop, it means you either made the bone/armature a parent to itself, or you made the bone/armature a parent to something that is a parent of it already. check for that, or you could delete all the parent links. [[Special:Contributions/74.185.212.232|74.185.212.232]] ([[User talk:74.185.212.232|talk]]) 21:50, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
== Manually assigning bones ==

I can't find the &quot;assign&quot; or &quot;remove&quot; buttons. I am in edit mode. [[Special:Contributions/74.185.212.232|74.185.212.232]] ([[User talk:74.185.212.232|talk]]) 21:45, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

I believe this should be moved to basic animantions. Shouldn't it?

I actually like it here,right after we made a box man, it just needs a little more continuity with the previous tutorials in this section [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 00:21, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

== Hat doesn't follow person ==

When I move the person, the hat doesn't follow.[[User:Bonapon|Bonapon]] ([[User talk:Bonapon|talk]]) 20:33, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

Try making the head bone (or whatever you named it) a parent of the hat. Reminder: Select the hat, then the head bone. Press CTRL+PKEY then select Armature &gt; Create from body heat. [[User:Scampfarmer|Scampfarmer]] ([[User talk:Scampfarmer|talk]]) 21:52, 2 May 2010 (UTC)

I am using 2.60.7 and &quot;Create from body heat&quot; does not seem to be an option. How can I make this work?

== Person does follow bones strangely==

If i try to rotate or move a bone, the bone and part of the person scales also up a lot. is there a possibility to only rotate a bone to rotate a bone in a direction without scaling?

What you want is, AFAIK, the normal behaviour. I don't know how you got your bone and your mesh scaled when rotating or moving the bone... --[[User:Jdackle|Jdackle]] ([[User talk:Jdackle|talk]]) 23:06, 15 May 2010 (UTC)


are you in pose mode?  if you start in object mode, and then RMB on a bone, they should all be selected, then go into pose mode ( click on the object mode/edit mode drop down. ince in pose mode you can only select and move bones [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 22:49, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

I wonder if this is the same problem I am experiencing...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Unexpected result when using armatures in Blender (before).jpeg|Unexpected result when using armatures in Blender (before)
File:Unexpected result when using armatures in Blender (after).jpeg|Unexpected result when using armatures in Blender (after)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
It seems that the further the mesh is from the fulcrum the greater the deviation from the armature's axis, this eventually results in the skull bending. The hat once assigned to the 'neck' joint in my case, acts as expected. This article seems largely aimed at 2.4 and I am using 2.5 but I followed the instructions to the best of my ability the only difference was that I had to discover for myself how to assign vertices to vertex group as that section seemed entirely aimed at a different version, and by default, the right forearm bone was pulling on the side of the face and half of the thigh so it was needed. Am I doing something wrong or does something need adding to the page?[[User:Lxxxv|Lxxxv]] ([[User talk:Lxxxv|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lxxxv|contribs]]) 18:03, 15 September 2011 (UTC)
:I found the problem, somehow I had multiple instances of the same armature acting on the mesh. I found there were 3 armatures (the same one three times) listed in the 'modifiers' tab when the mesh is selected, so I guess this was having an additive effect. When the bone moved, the mesh moved 3 times as much, while the hat which was done correctly, did not. Removing 2 of the modifiers fixed the problem. Maybe this will help someone else. [[User:Lxxxv|Lxxxv]] ([[User talk:Lxxxv|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lxxxv|contribs]]) 22:11, 15 September 2011 (UTC)

How's this for strange?  My left leg follows my right legbones and my right leg follows my left legbones.  How on earth would auto-generated weights do that?  - Asterai

== Scaling bones ==
The article says &quot;You might be tempted to scale a bone, but this will mess things up&quot;. To my admitedly short experience, scaling bones ('''SKEY''') never messed anything up. Could you please expand? Thank you, --[[User:Jdackle|Jdackle]] ([[User talk:Jdackle|talk]]) 23:15, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

I agree, it seems to make no difference.. I'll remove that sentance [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 04:12, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

== Are the photos too large? ==
I think the images could be cropped down to the important parts (i'm happy to do it too ), and pushed to the left or right in order to have better text flow, what do the rest of you think? [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 02:26, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

==  Assign and Remove buttons ==
I found pose mode, and my bones work great, but my box mans hat is being moved/stretched, when I move the arm bones, so I've gone looking for the Assign and Remove buttons, and can;t seem to find them in 2.49b. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:17, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

I finally found the Assign and Remove buttons, you need to go to object mode, RMB on the hat, go to edit mode, make sure you looking at teh editmode buttons in the bottom button window, and you will see on the left a link and materials panel with a pair of Assign and Remove buttons :). since you have the hat as the subject of this edit cycle, pick the correclty grop in the dropdown above, and then remove it, in my case i removed the hat from the lt_arm, and the rt_arm, I also set it's weight to zero for both groups, and now it no longer strechs, when I move the arms [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 14:25, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

== Tone ==

A lot changes with this page.  Referring to itself in the first person, I, and calling modules 'tutorials.'  Be nice to fix this all up

== Need for consistent terminology ==

It is unclear whether the armature is supposed to be the parent and the mesh the child, or vice versa.  Comparing to a similar process in the &quot;Putting the hat on the person&quot; module reveals that &quot;parenting a to b&quot; means different things in the different modules... probably.  The language is a little too unclear here to be sure.  At any rate, I'm confused and trying to pose my dude and the little fool doesn't seem to want to move either way.

K, figured out what I was doing wrong.  Adding note to book to clarify.  - Asterai

Okay, I can now make armature parent to mesh etc., but auto-weighting bones causes nonsensical behavior: Right leg follows left leg bones and left leg follows right leg bones, etc.  I would just get to work fixing this, but all the stuff in ''In depth info on selected bone topics'' describes... buttons that do not seem to be in my 2.61 interface.  And, what is a &quot;tab&quot;?  Was this term ever defined to us?  Any rate, I can find neither a window nor a subsection thereof named &quot;Links and Materials&quot; and cannot really proceed along this chain of actions.

== Needs to be updated based on the newest version of Blender ==

Is it possible that this could be re-written for version 2.61? Pretty much everything in the &quot;Parent the Bone&quot; section was written for earlier versions of Blender and the different notes for the different versions make it extremely confusing. Plus, it seems like the bones affect the model very differently in 2.61 than in earlier versions.

==Order of selection in parenting==
I know the instructions say you have to select the person first, then the armature; but doing this then pressing Ctrl + P only gave me the normal parenting menu, with the only option being &quot;Object.&quot; If, however I select the armature first, I got the menu that allowed me to choose &quot;Armature Deform.&quot; Which definitely made the armature the parent. This should be changed? [[Special:Contributions/169.147.3.25|169.147.3.25]] ([[User talk:169.147.3.25|discuss]]) 17:46, 25 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Raising Chickens}}

One of the most important factors to properly raise chickens is having a suitable chicken house or better known as chicken coop.  A chicken coop can be an old building or built from scratch. It is especially important that it is well ventilated, yet does not provide easy access for predatory animals such as dogs, foxes and wolves.  Another thing to keep in mind is the climate in your area.  In colder climates you would probably want to build a shelter that will hold in heat more.  While in warmer climate the opposite effect is more desired. The primary goal is to reach a comfortable temperature. 

Your coop should have some chicken wire under the floor if it is on the ground. If it is off the ground make sure it is high enough so that rodents don't nest under it. Also, make sure the ground absorbs moisture quick enough. To test this, dig a hole in the ground and pour a little water into it.   
Building a suitable coop is not an easy task. However, if you have some good guidance then it will be much easier.There are lots of plans available on the internet. Try searching for one which can explain to you the building process step by step.

There are many ways to find hatcheries

You could look in a local service directory or search the [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;biw=1024&amp;q=Chicken+Hatchery&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta= internet]

&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;center&gt;----'''Some Hatcheries'''----&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''Region'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''Hatchery'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Canada&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[http://www.rochesterhatchery.com/ Rochester]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;United States&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[http://www.mcmurrayhatchery.com/ McMurray Hatchery]&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.cacklehatchery.com/ Cackle Hatchery]&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.green-linehatchery.com/ Green-Line Hatchery]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
If you would like to add a hatchery to the list feel free to do so or post it on the [[Talk:Raising_Chickens/Finding_a_Hatchery|discussion page]] for this chapter.
== Additional Notes ==
An alternative to finding a hatchery is to find already grown hens/roosters. Many small growers are ready to give them away (free/barter/cheap) at the end of the laying season. Obviously your selection is limited to what's available, but this method saves the expense and trouble of dealing with chicks. Keep an eye on the local paper or bargain sheet. You can also ask anyone with a flock if they'd be willing to part with a few birds. Depending on the purpose of your flock, someone else's culls might be just the right birds for you. Be careful that you pick up healthy birds.

When you introduce new birds to your established flock, it won't take long for new and old birds to integrate and establish their &quot;pecking order.&quot; Not to worry, it looks nasty at first but they quickly work it out. If two of them insist on constantly fighting, they'll be so busy with each other that you can easily pick up and move one of the birds to another part of the pen. If you're adding a grown rooster to a flock that already has one, we recommend avoiding a new one that's been the only or head honcho at his old place. Pick the second or third in the pecking order if you have a choice so your current head rooster can get along with him.

Staring at an unsurmountable list of chicken breeds can be a dizzying experience, but not to worry.  The intended use of the chicken can narrow the list considerably. Two basic categories are meat birds (bred to
grow quickly to harvest weight) and egg layers (bred to lay lots of eggs). Deciding what will be expected from the chickens is half the battle, the other half is mostly preference. Breeds differ by appearence, general size, temperment, egg color for layers (white, cream, green, blue or brown), and quality of meat/eggs produced. Choosing the exact breed is up to the person raising the chickens.

More information can be found from any good [[Raising_Chickens/Finding_a_Hatchery|hatchery]].  In the [[Talk:Raising_Chickens/Choosing_a_breed|discussion page]] for this section you can find recommend breeds as well as problem breeds as found by other Wikibooks users.

'''Meat Breeds'''
Many people buy hybrids that are bred to grow to slaughter weight by around 8 weeks of age. These are commonly marketed under the names of [[w:Cornish Cross|Cornish Cross]] and [[w:Ross Cobb|Ross Cobb]].
There are also many pure breeds that are classified as meat breeds, such as the [[w:Sussex (chicken)|Sussex]] and [[w:Jersey Giant|Jersey Giant]].

If Y is negative, then Truncation is equivalent to [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Ceiling|X'Ceiling(Y)]]. If Y is positive, then Truncation is equivalent to [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Floor|X'Floor(Y)]].

== Example ==

 X : Float :=  1.5;
 Y : Float :=  1.0;
 Z : Float := -1.999;
  
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Truncation(X) =  1.0);  {{Template:Ada/comment|Ok}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Truncation(Y) =  1.0);  {{Template:Ada/comment|Ok}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Truncation(Z) = -1.0);  {{Template:Ada/comment|Ok}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Truncation(Z) = -2.0);  {{Template:Ada/comment|Wrong}}

 {{Ada/kw|function}} S'Copy_Sign (''Value'', ''Sign'' : ''T'')
   {{Ada/kw|return}} ''T''

== Description ==

S'Copy_Sign(X, Y) is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where S is any floating-point type, and X and Y are any instance of that type. This attribute represents the floating point value with the magnitude of X and the sign of Y.

If the resulting value is outside the base range of S, a Constraint_Error exception is raised.

== Example ==

 X : Float :=  1.5;
 Y : Float := -1.0;
 Z : Float :=  1.0;
  
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Copy_Sign ( X, Y) = -1.5);   {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Copy_Sign ( X, Z) =  1.5);   {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Copy_Sign (-X, Z) =  1.5);   {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (Float'Copy_Sign ( Y, Z) = -1.0);   {{Template:Ada/comment|Wrong}}

There is a limited space available in this template and I believe it should represent the best work available at any time. For now the limit is 50%, in the future it could be 75% or 100% or even (hopefully) featured status. As it stands now there are lots of incomplete and barely started links here which I don't believe represent what is available very well to the casual browser.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Self replicating automata are virtual lifeforms, and as such are subject to laws similar to the laws which govern life. The principle of evolution, that life forms are more or less suited for survival in a given environment, and that those that are more suited for survival are more likely to pass on their characteristics, is a general law of life that applies to SRAs as well as it does to biological lifeforms. A successful accidental mutation of an SRA, that bestows a favorable characteristic on an SRA, is of course very rare, as it is with all life, yet we know that SRAs are subject to intelligent design, and so their evolution may be guided by human programmers. Additionally, SRAs may be coded in such a manner that they have a virtual sexual function such that they might exchange code bits with other SRAs of the same species, thus SRAs may begin to evolve much more rapidly on their own.

I have been thinking it over and decided to face reality. I have lost all my believe in the wikimediaprojects. So much even that I am now adding content to places outside of the wikimediaprojects instead of having to deal with all the 100000000000000's of procedures and rules being implemented by people who do not even know how to write an article.

The projects have been taken over by a group of people, mostly teenagers, whom apparently have lost all sight of realism and have taken other people's work hostage, without creating one bit of content themselves. Who feel that adding templates, writing rules and policing (the process) is more important than what we set out to do. Also there is a very very very strong western bias in the projects. Ideas and processes are launched which might work perfectly in a western world (like the rules for verification) but which fall flat on their face when applied to non-western items. When someone actually rises this point on the lists (me) it is ignored.

Also Jimbo's statement that en: wikipedia has covered most subjects disappoints me. This might be true for subjects on developed countries. But the projects are heavily lacking in the same sort of content with regards to the developing world. While every lake in the US probably has an article. Most Asian / African / South American countries have barely got articles describing these kind of features. And if someone does write an article about it, it gets deleted as non-encyclopedic. Also wikipedia's become very nationalistic like the nl: wikipedia where a fairly large group feels non-Dutch and non-Belgian topics should not be covered in the Dutch language edition! And they actually wrote rules to enforce this.

The amount of people who only care about their own backyard (the west) and wanna delete everything they do not understand has grown to big. Also other idiocism like on nl: wikipedia where procedure is 100x more important than the smooth running of the project, resulting in an everyone can insult everyone situation and no-one get's actually blocked is taking to much time and stress.

Jimbo invented the wheel with the wikimedia projects. Unfortunately the wheel never evolved, nor will it in the current climate. Every form of progress of the projects in something meaningfull and working gets blocked or grinded in bureaucracy by a group of people who want to be the boss.

Meanwhile on the boardlevel politicians rule who only give a shit about themselves and about political games. I have seen many of these games played out over the years. Also the projects diversify to much and to much new niches where new small groups start that take their particular niche hostage (commons being a prime example) are started. Instead of looking at how things can co-operate people start their own new kingdoms and fiefdoms (like wikitionaryz, which is GerardM's fiefdom) into things that are not our core imho. We are about creating content, not spreading it, let other people do that job.

On some projects I still have moderating bits, I hereby ask the stewards to take these bits away as I do not wish to spend to much time anymore on the projects, I might shout a bit from the sideline. The wikimedia projects will always exist, and the original idea was great. Unfortunately Winston Churchill was right .... democracy works in theory only. When the masses take over like on our project, the sum gets lowered to the level of the masses. Which means herd thinking.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Greeno. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Greeno~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

----------

&quot;For Windows, Dev-C++ is recommended for its ease-of-use and simplicity of installation.&quot; -- but Dev-C++ isn't in the list!!

----------

the current microsoft &quot;free&quot; compiler offer is the 2008 edition which is the exact opposite to lightweight. tcc is lightweight. i'd like to see more classic tools like lcc on the list (after all it has a dennis ritchie code in it).

----------

Exactly why is this list so opposed to Microsoft?

----------

free microsoft compiler http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/

----------

The compilers from Microsoft is not free.  It reads &quot;Free, lightweight, easy-to-use, and easy-to-learn tools ''for the hobbyist, novice, and student developer''.&quot;  which means not for every one to use.  You have to read beyound the first word.  But it might be good for those who qualify with it's demands for free of charge use.
----------


Shouldn't (X)Emacs be here to?  It's a realy powerfull tool. And works fast and well with all major (and most minor) operating systems and programming languages.

== newbie oriented ==

Could the book be &quot;total noob&quot; friendly? I mean like, friendly to people who got no clue, but just want direct contact with the code itself?

For example, there beeing a direct link or a series of direct links for an IDE to be installed , linked to a certain compiler (or not needed if there is one built in), not as a commercial to point to a certain IDE, or compiler, but just to make stuff simple for a person just wanting to see the code, and having use of the book.

Sorry if my text is confusing.

== Vetting the Sept 2013 draft ==
Take it as you will, but from a professional C developer, the Sept 2013 proposal contains mostly legit changes. Bloodshed IS old, and Sublime is... eh, arguably popular, and there NO WAY that MVS can be considered lightweight. So yeah, call it good.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, I'm Daniel.

What else can I say...

You're free to contact me, ofcourse.

I'm a Dutch student (though currently without a study) who is planning to study medicine at some stage in his life. Right now, I've registered here at Wikibooks to work on the &quot;Medicine&quot; section ([[Medicine_bookshelf|see here]]) some. I noticed that some pages didn't exist at all, others contained unorganized and unusable information. So, I've been working on a new look for this part of Wikibooks.
* I have turned several specialties which were listed as part of &quot;Internal Medicine&quot; into full categories on their own, among them Cardiology, Neurology, Gastro-Enterology, Endocrinology etc.
* I just wrote a pretty extensive list of subjects for the Neurology site.
* I added a link to the appropriate chapter in the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (from which I learn a lot on my own) on all medical specialty pages. You can find the whole Manual online [http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmanual/sections.jsp here].
* I'm going to do the same for Cardiology, and after that for all specialties.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Daniel575. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Daniel575~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Solution A'''

One traditional answer to this problem is that in fact we only looking a constant amount of time ahead. To see this let us assume that the tortoise advances at unit speed and Achilles at speed x, starting y units behind the tortoise (say, at point 0). Then it takes Achilles &lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{x} &lt;/math&gt; units in time (say seconds) to reach the starting point of the tortoise. In the meantime the tortoise has advanced to the point &lt;math&gt; y + \frac{y}{x} &lt;/math&gt; being now &lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{x} &lt;/math&gt; units adhead. Since x &gt; 1 the distance has decreased. To reach the second point of the tortoise it takes Achilles the time of &lt;math&gt; \frac{y/x}{x} = \frac{y}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;. By induction we have, that it takes Achilles the time of &lt;math&gt; y\sum_{i=1}^n{x^{-i}} &lt;/math&gt; to reach the point the tortoise reached after her &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th advance.

For &lt;math&gt; n \to \infty &lt;/math&gt; this expression converges to &lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{1 - \frac{1}{x}} =:T &lt;/math&gt; which is clearly finite. Therefore in whole our race we are not considering points in time greater or equal than &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. In fact at &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; Achilles has reached the tortoise and is going to overtake it at any infinitesimal time thereafter.

However, the whole argument assumes that time is continuous. Is this true in turn?


All of these problems are flawed because at each 'step' they slow down time, and if you slow down time enough, obviously you don't achieve anything. If you move between the line A and B and take the time measurements each time you reduce the distance by half, there are an infinite measurements each being taken faster and faster. This does not mean Achilles will not catch the tortious, it just means they are taking an infinite number of measurements until he does.

==Hepatic Encephalopathy==

Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease. It occurs most often in patients with cirrhosis but also occurs in acute hepatic failure.
Aetiology
Hepatic encephalopathy is thought to be due to a biochemical disturbance of brain function because it is reversible and does not cause marked pathological changes in the brain. Liver failure and portosystemic shunting of blood are two important factors underlying hepatic encephalopathy and the balance between these varies in different patients. Some degree of liver failure is a constant factor as portosystemic shunting of blood hardly ever causes encephalopathy if liver function is normal. Little is known of the biochemical 'neurotoxins' causing the encephalopathy, but they are thought to be mainly nitrogenous substances produced in the gut, at least in part by bacterial action, which are normally metabolised by the healthy liver so that they do not enter the systemic circulation. Ammonia has long been considered an important factor but much interest has centred recently on gamma-aminobutyric acid. Additional putative culprit substances include other false neurotransmitters such as octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids. Some factors appear to precipitate hepatic encephalopathy by increasing the availability of these substances; in addition, the brain in cirrhosis may be sensitised to other factors such as drugs that are able to precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. Disruption of the function of the blood-brain barrier is a feature of acute hepatic failure and may lead to cerebral oedema.
 	
Clinical features

These include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs. When an episode develops acutely a precipitating factor may be found . The earliest features are very mild but, as the condition becomes more severe, apathy, inability to concentrate, confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, slurring of speech and eventually coma develop. Convulsions sometimes occur. Examination usually shows a flapping tremor (asterixis), inability to perform simple mental arithmetic tasks or draw objects such as a star (constructional apraxia), and, as the condition progresses, hyper-reflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Hepatic encephalopathy rarely causes focal neurological signs, and if these are present, other causes must be sought. Fetor hepaticus, a sweet musty odour to the breath, is usually present but is more a sign of liver failure and portosystemic shunting than of hepatic encephalopathy. Rarely, chronic hepatic encephalopathy (hepatocerebral degeneration) gives rise to variable combinations of cerebellar dysfunction, Parkinsonian syndromes, spastic paraplegia and dementia.
Investigations
The diagnosis can usually be made clinically, but when doubt exists an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows diffuse slowing of the normal alpha waves with eventual development of delta waves. The arterial ammonia is usually increased in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. However, increased concentrations can occur in the absence of clinical encephalopathy so this investigation is of little or no diagnostic value.

Episodes of encephalopathy are common in cirrhosis and are usually readily reversible until the terminal stages occur. The principles of management are to treat or remove precipitating causes, to reduce protein intake, and to suppress production of neurotoxins by bacteria in the bowel. Dietary protein is reduced to less than 20 g/day, and glucose (300 g/day) is given orally or parenterally in severe cases. As encephalopathy improves, dietary protein is increased by 10-20 g/day every 48 hours to an intake of 40-60 g/day, which is usually the limit in cirrhotic patients. Lactulose (15-30 ml 8-hourly) is a disaccharide which is taken orally and reaches the colon intact to be metabolised by colonic bacteria. The dose is increased gradually until the bowels are moving twice daily. It produces an osmotic laxative effect, reduces the pH of the colonic content, thereby limiting colonic ammonia absorption, and promotes the incorporation of nitrogen into bacteria (see EBM panel). Lactitol is a rather more palatable alternative to lactulose, with a less explosive action on bowel function. Neomycin (1-4 g 4-6-hourly) is an antibiotic which acts by reducing the bacterial content of the bowel. It can be used in addition or as an alternative to lactulose if diarrhoea becomes troublesome. Neomycin is poorly absorbed from the bowel but sufficient gains access to the body to contraindicate its use when uraemia is present. It is less desirable than lactulose for long-term use; ototoxicity is the main deleterious effect. Chronic or refractory hepatic encephalopathy is one of the main indications for liver transplantation.

Bacteria can be classified by general morphology.  Characteristic cell shape and size help to name and differentiate microorganisms. There are five types of bacterial cells: Cocci, Bacilli, Coccobacilli, Fusiform, and Spirilla.  Cocci bacterium are spherical or oval shape.  The cocci can occur in pairs (diplococci), chains (streptococci), and irregular clusters (staphylococci). The entire bacterial cell is very small, about the size of an eukaryotic mitochondria.  The second type, bacilli, are rod shaped. Coccibacilli are very short rods that can easily be mistaken for cocci.  Fusiform are rod-shaped bacteria that have tapered ends (like an American football). Spirilla are spiral shaped.  If the spirilla is spiral shaped and the cell is more flexible it is called a spirochete.

====Part III Medical Microbiology====
Medical Microbiology is an important concept, generally dealing with microbes that cause diseases. It helps to find the effect of microbes in producing diseases and the remedial of the diseases. One of the major field of Medical Microbiology is the study of antibiotics producing organisms.

The following fields are related to Medical Microbiology:
Immunology
Bacteriology
Virology
Pharmacology

Industrial Microbiology      

Introduction-

Use of microbes in industrial or large scale productions is known as industrial microbiology. Mostly the bacteria and fungi are used in industrial applications. Bacteria have the property of rapid reproduction, as they divide rapidly leading to an exponential increase in population. By using bacteria we can transform substrates into more useful or valuable products.

Modern Industrial Microbiology has evolved in demand to develop cheap and faster substitute of chemical reactions. In earlier years of industrial development the transformation reactions are carried out by several steps of lengthy and delicate chemical reactions. They are very hard to control, depend on various other factors, sometimes require harsh conditions like high temperature, high pressure, use of alkali and acids and use of costly transition metals as catalyst. Often, performing a single transformation requires many steps of chemical reaction. By using industrial microbiology we can transform substrates without such harsh conditions more easily than ever.

Microbes are also used to produce antibiotics, vitamins, amino acids, organic acids, alcohols, and also as food called single cell proteins (SCP).

In industrial microbiology we use the native properties of microbes to grow in various environmental conditions (can use various materials as their carbon/energy source).  The yeast sacchromyces spp. for example, can grow in both in presence or absence of oxygen. When it grows in presence of oxygen it breaks glucose into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water and yields energy for growth. while growing in anaerobic conditions it produces ethyl alcohol and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and just survives with little growth. This property was identified earlier in the development of humankind and thus humans started production of various alcoholic beverages.

; List of Products

* Ethanol
* Acetic acid
* Lactic acid
* Vitamins
* Amino acids
* Enzymes
* Some insecticides
* Lipids
* Coloring compounds
* Polysaccharides(gum)

Most important use of microbes is as enzyme producers. In the beginnings of microbiology it was discovered that something within the yeast is responsible for the conversion of sugar into alcohol. This biological compound was known as an enzyme ( en= within, zyme= yeast) 

Nowadays the following industrially important enzymes are produced by microbes:
* Amylases (to degrade starch)
* Proteases (to degrade proteins)
* Lipases (to degrade lipids)
* Pectinases (clarification of wine and fruit juices)
* Cellulases (to convert cellulose into glucose)
* Proteases and lipases are used as additives in modern detergents.

Microbes naturally produce enzymes in order to utilize the food sources present around them. For example, various fungi and bacteria growing on fruit-based substrates produce pectinases and cellulases to degrade the materials present on the cell wall of fruit cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Note to Alan: 'Back Pain'===
You added a section on 'Back Pain' to the Anatomy &amp; Physiology section. Needless to say, this subject has nothing to do with the section on Anatomy &amp; Physiology. I moved your book to the 'Alternative Medicine' section, since it is, as you write there, a book written by patients focusing on self-help therapies. As such, it belongs in the 'Alternative Medicine' section, not under 'Anatomy &amp; Physiology', and, with all due respect, not under 'Clinical Medicine' either.
--[[User:Daniel575|Daniel575]] 15 Aug 2005

It doesn't belong in the Alternative Medicine section unless it is (supposedly) an alternative to medical science. If the book does not reject medical science, and is a self help book, there should be a self help section (possibly with a warning about the dangers of self help). [[Special:Contributions/59.100.150.141|59.100.150.141]] ([[User talk:59.100.150.141|talk]]) 15:58, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

===Added &quot;Category:Medicine&quot; on all pages; divided main page into three subjects (anatomy, clinical, alternative)===
--[[User:Daniel575|Daniel575]] 14:57, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)


Hi,
I'm Daniel ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Daniel575 ), from The Netherlands. I started working on the medical section of Wikibooks this morning; been writing for about 4 hours now. I pretty much reorganized http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Medicine_bookshelf and merged http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Medicine into this site (if you go to Medicine now, you'll be redirected to Medicine_bookshelf). Medicine_bookshelf had a better beginning. I edited the Internal Medicine section and took out some of the specialties listed there and gave them their own categories (neurology, cardiology, pulmonology etc.). Started working on a few articles also, but first I'm mainly adding links to external pages (Merck Manual, which is my personal favorite; it's the Bible of Medicine as far as I'm concerned), and after that I plan on adding links to appropriate pages on Emedicine ( www.emedicine.com/specialties.htm, you probably know it).

When the categories have been created sufficiently, I'm going to let the real specialists do the rest. But the way things looked this morning was really awful. The Medicine site was basically empty except for a few words with no links in them; most of the links from Medicine_bookshelf were nonexistant; and sometimes I found texts that were basically written without any consideration for an appropriate categorization. 
 
Most of the categories inside the specialty pages I created were written based on the index of subjects in the M-Manual. I'm not sure whether this is allowed; after all, I am not really copying any content, just the subject titles. Do you know whether this is allowed? I changed the names of most subjects somewhat, but nevertheless, I'm not sure whether it's allowed. We cannot copy any real content ofcourse (that would be just too easy), but it's definitely a useful book.

Others interested in this page: you're all invited to discuss here. If nobody minds, I'm going to continue creating some index pages for several specialties, which will take some time, ofcourse. I created a pretty basic index for Neurology today, which is a good beginning.

== Attention Daniel575: Orthopaedic vs Orthopedic ==

I started with the &lt;tt&gt;Orthopaedic Surgery&lt;/tt&gt; module. Since I am from India (Our English is more British oriented than American), I am more comfortable with &lt;tt&gt;Ortho&lt;u&gt;paed&lt;/u&gt;ic&lt;/tt&gt; than &lt;tt&gt;Ortho&lt;u&gt;ped&lt;/u&gt;ic&lt;/tt&gt; and thats how I started out with the module. Since you had already a page on &lt;tt&gt;Orthopedic Surgery&lt;/tt&gt;, I didn't change that and went on with my contributions to rearranging the module. Now I find that most of the pages in wikibooks and all its sister concerns prefer &lt;tt&gt;orthopedic&lt;/tt&gt; over &lt;tt&gt;orthpaedic&lt;/tt&gt;. That leaves me confused!! 

Convention is better over individual preferences ...thats what seems to be nagging me. If I have to change I better do it now at an early stage. I would like to get your opinion on this before I go ahead and take a decison.

Anybody else who has got an opinion is most welcome to air them here!

[[User:Bduttabaruah|Bduttabaruah]] 05:14, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

: I think I have waited enough. I realised that [[Wikipedia:British English|British English]] ([[Wikipedia:BrE|BrE]])differs from [[Wikipedia:American English|American English]] ([[Wikipedia:AmE|AmE]]) in many ways(Please read [[Wikipedia:American and British English differences|American and British English differences]] for a more detailed elaboration on the topic). At the end of the day, there is no doubt that usage of [[Wikipedia:AmE|AmE]] is becoming more prevalent, but at the same time [[Wikipedia:BrE|BrE]] has its own place in the world. Neither of the two will or necessarily should be predominant. Each region will develop its own style and the use one particular form will become more widespread. I believe it will be a mixture of both  [[Wikipedia:AmE|AmE]] and [[Wikipedia:BrE|BrE]]. As far as use of medical terms is concerned I decided to stick to the easier naming and spelling convention as the terms are long and difficult. Henceforth I propose the use orthopEdic over orthopAEdic in [[Wikibooks]].

:[[User:Bduttabaruah|BDB]] 16:44, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

Most of the pages are linked through using the spelling &quot;orthopaedic&quot;, which I'm sure will be easily recognised by anyone more familiar with the spelling &quot;orthopedic&quot;. It seems sensible to go with something that can easily be used consistently throughout. Probably best to do the easiest thing to make all pages consistent - ie change all pages so they begin with &quot;Orthopaedic Surgery/&quot;. If there's really a demand to change the spelling later, it will at least then be easy enough to get a bot to do the work, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:54, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

By far, most books and articles we use in medical school in europe spell latin based words the BrE way. This is also the spelling more similar to the latin spelling used in the anatomy books world wide, aswell as in elderly books on other native languages.So I think it is a great idea to by routine include both BrE and AmE.

== Module Merge list ==

I'm sure there are others, but here is a module that needs to be moved into this [[bookshelf]] somewhere:

*[[Van Der Woude syndrome]]

Do with it as you can, and add a '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' markup tag if you don't think it is needed on Wikibooks.  Thanks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:33, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

== Spanish wikilink ==

You could add a link to the spanish medicine books; the link is  '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[es:Estantería de ciencias de la salud]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.

== Other languages ==

Add a link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[eo:Sanscienca librobretario]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

: Add it . --[[User:Mac|Mac]] ([[User talk:Mac|talk]]) 10:04, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

== Alternative Medicine ==

Alternative medicine does not belong in the &quot;Health Science&quot; section, since it opposes science. Can someone move it to the humanities section where it belongs? And add a warning? [[Special:Contributions/59.100.150.141|59.100.150.141]] ([[User talk:59.100.150.141|talk]]) 15:58, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

[[eo:Sanscienca librobretario]]
[[es:ciencias de la salud]]

== Medicine English ==

I suggest a book aboub [[medicine English]] (and the same for other languages, i.e. Spanish). --[[User:Mac|Mac]] ([[User talk:Mac|talk]]) 09:58, 27 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

| They don’t tell you how quiet hospitals can get in the middle of the night.  They don’t tell you that the sores on the skin smell strange, like from some other world.  They don’t tell you that bodies can release fluids from almost any pore in rapid succession; kind of like the way tears come flying from eyes, yellow and red stuff can come out of a wrist.  They don’t tell you that the whole place smells like a mixture of urine and antiseptic. They don’t tell you – though you’re not surprised – that most of the religious people going from room to room and bed to bed won’t stop to talk to you, will flinch if you try to shake their hand on the rare occasion they do stop by, and might leave miniature Bibles outside the door while you and your companion sleep inside.  They don’t tell you how hard it is to hold someone and sleep in a hospital bed.  They don’t tell you that the some doctors, nurses and other medical staff will bring you food, try to make your companion laugh, show you how to use the coffee machine for free as if you work there, bring you a “good” blanket from home, and harass any religious people that give you and especially your companion a hard time.  They don’t tell you that other doctors, nurses, and other medical staff will try to get you to leave, will avoid contact with your body and your eyes just in case you have caught your companion’s condition and they have already forgot how transmission works, will be overheard saying things like, “Well, he probably asked for it,” or will ask you to close the door to your companion’s room because it might upset people.  They don’t tell you that when you feed someone ice chips you need to move slow and softly and be ready to hold them if they start to choke on something even that small.  They don’t tell you what it feels like to watch your first love die from AIDS. Even though they don't tell you any of these things, I can promise you that you’ll never forget it no matter how hard you try.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Hoact21.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A doctor conducting a pre-natal examination of a patient in El Salvador.]]

The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines '''health''' as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and does not consist only of the absence of disease or infirmity&quot; ([http://w3.whosea.org/aboutsearo/const.htm source]) Though this is a useful definition, some would consider it idealistic and non-realistic because using the WHO definition classifies 70-95% of people as unhealthy.  There can also be other definitions of health, e.g. statistical (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) and functional (ability to carry out Activities of Daily Living or ADLs). The WHO definition also overlooks the fact that several factors influence both the definition of health and standards of health.

[[Image:Babyimmunization.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Immunizations from various diseases have improved health worldwide.]]

What it means to be healthy can vary from culture to culture and is often connected with advances in technology and cultural patterns of race, class, gender, and sexual inequalities.  In some cultures, larger body sizes are seen as a sign of healthiness as it indicates an individual has a preponderance of food.  In other cultures, largeness is more closely associated with unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., lack of exercise, poor eating habits, etc.). Advances in technology have also expanded the idea of what it means to be healthy.  What are understood today to be healthy practices were not emphasized prior to clear understandings of disease and the contributions of lifestyles to health, and some practices advanced as &quot;healthy&quot; today are the result of cultural beliefs that benefit some at the expense of others. Finally, sociologists have demonstrated that access, utilization, education, and practices related to health and well being are heavily influenced by (and often seemingly determined by) prevailing cultural norms, beliefs, and patterns that often have little or nothing to do with physiological health.

'''Health care''' (or '''healthcare''') is an industry associated with the prevention, treatment, and management of [[w:illness|illness]] along with the promotion of mental and physical well-being through the services offered by the [[w:medical|medical]] and [[w:allied health|allied health]] professions. Healthcare is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries, consuming over 10 percent of [[w:gross domestic product|gross domestic product]] of most developed nations.  In 2000, health care costs paid to hospitals, doctors, diagnostic laboratories, pharmacies, [[w:medical device|medical device]] manufacturers and other components of the health care system, consumed an estimated 14 percent of the [[w:GNP|gross national product]] of the United States, the largest of any country in the world.  For the [[w:G8|G8]] countries (eight of the most developed countries in the world) the average is about nine percent.  Importantly, this may be due to the United States' interesting position as the only G8 and highly developed country that, since [[w: The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973|The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]], utilizes a private, for profit system of [[w: managed care|managed care]] rather than a public good, non-profit system of health promotion.  In fact, the U.S. healthcare system generally costs more, produces equal or worse outcomes, incentivizes treatment over prevention, emphasizes cures over health, values quantity over quality of life, uses a lot of advanced technologies, and is heavily determined by &quot;market forces&quot; in comparison to healthcare systems (some nonprofit and some for profit) in other developed countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosich2010&quot;&gt;Rosich, Katherine and Janet Hankin. 2010. “Executive Summary: What Do We Know? Key Findings from 50 Years of Medical Sociology.” Journal of Health and Social Behavior, Extra Issue, 51:S1-S9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring patterns like those noted above in relation to U.S. healthcare, [[w: Medical Sociology|Medical Sociology]] is concerned with the distribution of healthcare services globally, in particular inequalities in healthcare, and how conceptions of health have changed over time.

==Health Disparities==
[[Image:Tobias-AIDS-test.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In an effort to dispel the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS testing in Ethiopia, Randall Tobias, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, was publicly tested.]]

While technology has advanced the practice of medicine and generally improved health, not all people have the same access to health care or the same quality of health care.  According to the [[w:Health Resources and Services Administration|Health Resources and Services Administration]] of the U.S., ''health disparities'' are the &quot;population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care&quot; ([http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=4&amp;q=http://www.hrsa.gov/OMH/OMH/disparities/pages07to08.pdf&amp;e=9888 source]). Of particular interest to sociologists are the differences in health and quality of health care across racial, socioeconomic, ethnic, gender, and sexual groups. 

In the United States, health disparities are well documented in racial minority populations such as [[w:|African Americans]], [[w:Native Americans|Native Americans]], [[w:Asian Americans|Asian Americans]], and [[w:Hispanics|Hispanics]]. When compared to European Americans, these minority groups have higher incidents of chronic diseases, higher mortality, and poorer health outcomes. Among the disease-specific examples of racial and ethnic disparities in the United States is the cancer incidence rate among African Americans, which is 10 percent higher than among European Americans and generally linked to the environmental conditions of predominantly racial minority neighborhoods. In addition, American adults of African and Hispanic lineage have approximately twice the risk of developing diabetes than American adults of European lineage, which often reflects the lack of access to quality foods and healthcare resources within predominantly racial minority neighborhoods.  Minorities also have higher rates of [[w:cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disease]], [[w:HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], and [[w:infant mortality|infant mortality]] than whites, which suggests the lack of preventative services and education in predominantly racial minority neighborhoods and schools may play an important role.  There are also substantial differences in health based on social class or socioeconomic status, which have also been linked to neighborhood concentration and environmental effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon2009&quot;&gt;Simon, Stephanie, and Betsy McKay. 2009. “Developing World's Parasites, Disease Hit U.S..” wsj.com, August 22 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125090339313750961.html (Accessed August 24, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009, diseases that were common only in the developed world (e.g., [[W:toxocariasis|toxocariasis]], [[w:cysticercosis|cysticercosis]], [[w:chagas|chagas]], and [[w:cytomegalovirus|cytomegalovirus]]) were becoming a serious concern among economically disadvantaged populations in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon2009&quot;/&gt;  Building on these insights, sociologists and public health researchers have documented a wide variety of racial and economic health disparities tied to neighborhood and environmental contexts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Burdette2012a&quot;&gt;Burdette, Amy M. and Belinda L. Needham. 2012. “Neighborhood Environment and BMI Trajectories from Adolescence to Adulthood” Journal of Adolescent Health 50: 30-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burdette2012b&quot;&gt;Burdette, Amy M.

Burdette, and Lauren Hale. 2009.  “Neighborhood Disorder, Sleep Quality, and Psychological Distress: A Model of Structural Amplification” Health and Place 15: 1006- 1013&lt;/ref&gt; and have even begun requiring graduate courses and training workshops on neighborhood contexts for public health, epidemiological, and medical sociology researchers.

Researchers have also documented significant health disparities within gender and sexual minority populations in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rieker2013&quot;&gt;Rieker, Patricia, Chloe Bird, and Martha Lang. 2013. “Understanding Gender and Health: Old Patterns, New Trends, and Future Directions.” Pp. 52−74 in Handbook of Medical Sociology, 6th Edition, edited by C. Bird, P. Conrad, A. Fremont, and S. Timmermans. Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of gender, for example, researchers have found that women and trans people experience significantly different treatment from health care providers, and often experience more chronic conditions throughout the life course.  Further, these researchers have noted the tendency for medical research to prioritize illnesses that are more common in heterosexual men while downplaying, ignoring, and stigmatizing conditions that are more common among other gender and sexual groups.  In terms of sexualities, for example, researchers have documented the systematic exclusion of non-heterosexual healthcare needs, priorities, and concerns throughout medical history, training programs, and certification processes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dececco1999&quot;&gt;John Dececco Phd, Michael Scarce.  1999.

The Invention of Heterosexuality.

===Causes of Health Disparities===
There is debate about what causes health disparities between dominant and subordinate groups. However, it is generally accepted that disparities can result from three main areas:
*From the differences in [[w:socioeconomic|socioeconomic]] and [[w:environmental|environmental]] characteristics of different ethnic and racial groups. For instance, American Africans and Hispanics tend to live in poorer neighborhoods that are near to industrial areas and are older than new suburban subdivisions.  Industrial pollutants and lead-paint, common in older homes, can both lead to increased incidents of disease.  Similarly, gender and sexual minorities are more likely to be displaced from their homes at earlier ages (e.g., with less symbolic and economic capital) than other members of society.  
*From the barriers certain minority groups encounter when trying to enter into the health care delivery system.
*From the quality of health care different minority groups receive.

Most attention on the issue has been given to the health outcomes that result from differences in access to medical care among groups and the quality of care different groups receive. Reasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following:
*Lack of insurance coverage. Without health insurance, patients are more likely to postpone medical care, more likely to go without needed medical care, and more likely to go without prescription medicines. Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than members of dominant groups.
*Lack of a regular source of care. Without access to a regular source of care, patients have greater difficulty obtaining care, fewer doctor visits, and more difficulty obtaining prescription drugs. Compared to whites, minority groups in the United States are less likely to have a doctor they go to on a regular basis and are more likely to use emergency rooms and free or reduced rate, government subsidized [[w:clinics|clinics]] as their regular source of care.
*Lack of financial resources. Although the lack of financial resources is a barrier to health care access for many Americans, the impact on access appears to be greater for minority populations. 
*Structural barriers. Structural barriers to health care include poor transportation, an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours, and excessive time spent in the waiting room, all of which affect a person's ability and willingness to obtain needed care.
*The health financing system. The [[w:Institute of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] in the United States says fragmentation of the U.S. health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers.  
*Scarcity of providers. In inner cities, rural areas, and communities with high concentrations of minority populations, access to medical care can be limited due to the scarcity of primary care practitioners, specialists, and diagnostic facilities.  In addition more private practices are putting limits on the number of medicaid and medicare patients that they will accept because these programs reimburse at a much lower percentage than private insurers.  Finding physicians who accept [[w:Medicaid|Medicaid]] and [[w:Medicare|Medicare]] is becoming increasingly difficult.  
*Linguistic barriers. Language differences restrict access to medical care for minorities in the United States who are not English-proficient.  
*Low Health literacy. This is where patients have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, patients with a poor understanding of good health may not know when it is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms.  Similarly, they may not understand the medical jargon that is used by health professionals and, consequently, are unable to accurately follow medical instructions. While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors. 
*Lack of [[w:diversity|diversity]] in the health care workforce. Cultural differences between predominantly white health care providers and minority patients is also often cited as a barrier to health care. Only 4% of physicians in the United States are African American; Hispanics represent just 5%. These percentages are much lower than these groups' respective proportions of the United States population.
*Provider discrimination. This is where health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently than they treat their white patients. Some research suggests that minorities are less likely than whites to receive a kidney transplant once on dialysis or to receive pain medication for bone fractures. Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions. Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences.

===Examples of Health Disparities===
There are a number of ways in which health disparities play out based on different systems of stratification.  Health disparities resulting from economic stratification are wide-ranging.  Poorer women have reduced access to mammograms to detect breast cancer, even when they are better candidates for screening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2008&quot;&gt;Williams, Brie A., Karla Lindquist, Rebecca L. Sudore, Kenneth E. Covinsky, and Louise C. Walter. 2008. “Screening Mammography in Older Women: Effect of Wealth and Prognosis.” Arch Intern Med 168:514-520.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wealthier people live longer than poorer people.  Wealthier people in the U.S. today live about 4.5 years longer than poorer people (79.2 vs. 74.7, respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pear2008&quot;&gt;Pear, Robert. 2008. “Gap in Life Expectancy Widens for the Nation.” The New York Times, March 23 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/us/23health.html (Accessed March 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, affluent and more educated people are more likely to take advantages of advances in medical science and technology and have seen a more rapid decline in smoking rates, which directly improves health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pear2008&quot;/&gt;  Disparities in health care between the rich and poor are not inevitable - they are directly correlated with disparities in wealth.  The differential and unequal treatment of the rich and poor follows the gap between the rich and the poor: From 1966 to 1980, socioeconomic disparities declined in tandem with a decline in mortality rates, but the disparity has since increased as income stratification has, and as our healthcare model has become mostly private, for profit, and insurance based.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pear2008&quot;/&gt;

Financial access to health care is not the only factor that affects health; poorer people are generally less likely to exercise, resulting in overall poorer health as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wen2007&quot;&gt;Wen M, Browning CR &amp; Cagney K. 2007. “A multi-level study of neighborhood environment and its relationship to physical activity in adulthood” Urban Studies:44(13): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is probably due to fewer opportunities to exercise and less access to safe, clean exercise facilities.  Poorer individuals also live in more dangerous neighborhoods and are more likely to eat unhealthy food (or lack the resources necessary to prepare healthy food they acquire) and engage in risky or unhealthy behavior (often as a result of a lack of options for healthy and less risky behaviors within their environments), all of which contributes to poorer health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pear2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Akers2011&quot;&gt;Akers, Aletha Y., Melvin R. Muhammad, and Giselle Corbie-Smith. 2011. “‘When you got nothing to do, you do somebody’: A community’s perceptions of neighborhood effects on adolescent sexual behaviors.” Social Science &amp; Medicine 72:91-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, researchers also find health disparities based on gender and sexual stratification.  One study found that women are less likely than men to be recommended for knee replacement surgery, even when they have the same symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borkhoff2008&quot;&gt;Borkhoff, Cornelia M. et al. 2008. “The effect of patients' sex on physicians' recommendations for total knee arthroplasty.” CMAJ 178:681-687.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was unclear what role the sex of the recommending physicians played, the authors of this study encourage women to challenge their doctors in order to get care equivalent to men.  Expanding on examples like this, researchers have noted that the ways medical professionals approach sexual and gender minorities are often heavily sexualized and gendered, which creates barriers for gender and sexual minorities - even those with the economic and educational resources to acquire care.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giuffre2000&quot;&gt;Giuffre, Patti A., and Christine L. Williams. 2000. “NOT JUST BODIES Strategies for Desexualizing the Physical Examination of Patients.” Gender &amp; Society 14(3):457–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2011&quot;/&gt;

Health disparities based on race also exist.  Similar to the difference in life expectancy found between the rich and the poor, affluent white women live 14 years longer in the U.S. (81.1 years) than poor black men (66.9 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pear2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith2010&quot;/&gt;  There is also evidence that blacks receive less aggressive medical care than whites, similar to what happens with women compared to men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pear2008&quot;/&gt;  Black men describe their visits to doctors as stressful and report that physicians do not provide them with adequate information to implement the recommendations they are given, similar to gender and sexual minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith2010&quot;&gt;Griffith, D.M., Allen, J.O. &amp; Gunter, K. (2010). Social and Cultural Factors Influence African American Men’s Medical Help-seeking.  Research on Social Work Practice. Published online 18 November 2010. Special issue on African American males.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributor to the overall worse health of blacks is the incident of HIV/AIDS - the rate of new AIDS cases is 10 times higher among blacks than whites and blacks are 20 times as likely to have HIV/AIDS as are whites, which is generally due to the structural violence (e.g., poverty, lack of health education, lack of access to medical care, and lack of sexual education) plaguing contemporary African-American communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adimora2009&quot;&gt;Adimora, Adaora A., Victor J. Schoenbach, and Michelle A. Floris-Moore. 2009. “Ending the Epidemic of Heterosexual HIV Transmission Among African Americans.” American Journal of Preventive Medicine 37:468-471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane2004&quot;&gt;Lane, Sandra D. et al. 2004. “Structural Violence and Racial Disparity in HIV Transmission.” Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved 15(3):319–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paying for Medical Care==
As noted in the previous section, disparities in health care are often related to an individual's or a group's ability to pay for health care.  This section discusses the costs of healthcare and the different approaches to health care that have been taken by governments around the world.

===Health Insurance===
'''Health insurance''' is a type of insurance whereby the insurer pays the medical costs of the insured if the insured becomes sick due to covered causes or accidents.  The insurer may be a private organization or a government agency. According to the 2005 United States Census Bureau, approximately 85% of Americans have health insurance. Approximately 60% obtain health insurance through their place of employment or as individuals and various government agencies provide health insurance to 25% of Americans.  Despite the claims of the [[w: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], however, it is important to remember that researchers have demonstrated that access to health insurance will have a limited impact on health disparities due to the importance of varied types of social, psychological, material, symbolic, and political resources in the overall construction, maintenance, and challenge of health inequalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross2000&quot;&gt;Ross, Catherine and John Mirowsky. 2000. “Does Medical Insurance Contribute to Socioeconomic Differentials in Health?” The Milbank Quarterly 78:291−321.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the rising cost of health care is debated, some contributing causes are accepted.  Aging populations require more health care as a result of increased life expectancy.  Advances in medical technology have arguably driven up the prices of procedures, especially cutting edge and experimental procedures. Poor health choices also increase health care costs by increasing the incident of disease and disability.  Preventable health issues are related to:
*insufficient exercise
*[[w:junk food|unhealthy food choices]]
*excessive alcohol consumption
*[[w:smoking|smoking]]
*[[w:obesity|obesity]] (more on this below)

In theory, people could lower health insurance prices by exercising, eating healthy food, and avoiding addictive substances that are damaging to the body. Healthier lifestyles protect the body from disease, and with fewer diseases, there would be fewer health care related expenses, but healthier lifestyles rely upon the opportunity to possess favorable economic resources and neighborhood location (e.g., exercise, food choices, obesity), and the ability to avoid (or find alternate ways to manage) experiencing continuous stress exposure, traumatic events, and structural violence (e.g., alcohol and cigarette consumption).  

Another element of high health care costs is related to the private management of healthcare by large corporations.  While this is discussed in greater detail below, it is worth noting that corporate profits have also played a role in increased health care premiums.

===Private Insurance and Free-Market Health Care===
Two types of health insurance have developed in modern society: private health insurance (or free-market) models and publicly funded health insurance models.  The benefits and drawbacks of each of these models are discussed in this and the following section.

Private insurance refers to health insurance provided by a non-governmental organization, usually a privately owned or publically traded corporation.  Private insurance as the primary provider of health care in a developed nation is really only found in the United States as of 1973.  It is important to note that while the United States is the most private of any system, there is a substantial public component. Of every dollar spent on health care in the United States, 44 cents comes from some level of government. In addition, government also increases private sector costs by imposing licensing and regulatory barriers to entry into both the practice of medicine and the drug trade within America. Private practitioners also face inflated costs through the government's use of [[w:protectionist|protectionist]] measures against foreign companies, to uphold the [[w:intellectual property rights|intellectual property rights]] of the U.S. [[w:pharmaceutical|pharmaceutical]] industry.

Advocates of the private model argue that this approach to health care has the following benefits:
*Some economists argue that the free market is better able to allocate discretionary spending where consumers value it the most. There is variation among individuals about how much they value peace of mind and a lower risk of death. For example, while a public-funded system (see below) might decide to pay for a pap smear only once every five years if the patient was not positive for the human papilloma virus based on cost efficiency, in a private system a consumer can choose to be screened more often and enjoy the luxury of greater peace of mind and marginally reduced risk.  When evaluating the pool of current medical spending available to fund cost effective care for the uninsured, this discretionary spending might be moved to non-medical luxury goods.  Also, since current private plans are not very good at limiting spending to cost effective procedures and schedules, those consumers exploiting this will view the transition to a public system as a reduction in their compensation or benefits, and will question whether a society that will allow them to buy a better car or a European vacation, but not better health care, is truly free. 
*Advocates also point to the remarkable advances in medical technology that have accompanied the private insurance/free-market approach to health care.  When health care is privately funded, the opportunity for making large amounts of money is an attractive proposition for researchers in medical technology and pharmaceuticals.  Thus, the private insurance system, while it may not provide adequate care for everyone (see the criticisms below), does provide cutting edge technology for those who can afford it.
*Advocates also argue that private industry is more efficient than government, which can be quite susceptible to bloat and bureaucracy.  However, as is discussed below, this is not always true.

Despite these possible benefits, the private insurance approach is not without its drawbacks. Following are some of the more common criticisms of the private health insurance approach to health care:
*As noted above, private insurance can be a boon to those who can afford the cutting edge technology.  But the flipside to this boon is that the United States, the only mostly-private health delivery system in a developed country, is below average among developed nations by almost every health measure, including: [[w:infant mortality|infant mortality]], [[w:life expectancy|life expectancy]], [[w:chronic disease|chronic diseases]] and [[w:cancer|cancer]] survival rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks2006&quot;&gt;Banks, James; Marmot, Michael; Oldfield, Zoe, and Smith, James P. Disease and Disadvantage in the United States and in England. JAMA. 2006 May 3; 295(17):2037-2045&lt;/ref&gt;  As evidence of this, people in lower socioeconomic classes in the US are significantly more likely to contract a preventable disease than are people in higher socioeconomic classes, which is not the case in Canada, where they have universal healthcare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willson2009&quot;&gt;Willson, Andrea E. 2009. “'Fundamental Causes' of Health Disparities: A Comparative Analysis of Canada and the United States.” International Sociology 24:93-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is directly attributable to reduced access to healthcare in the US for those with less money.
*More than half of the people with chronic conditions in the US regularly skip pills and doctors' appointments for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and depression because of the cost of the care.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoen2009&quot;&gt;Schoen, Cathy, Robin Osborn, Sabrina K.H. How, Michelle M. Doty, and Jordon Peugh. 2009. “In Chronic Condition: Experiences Of Patients With Complex Health Care Needs, In Eight Countries, 2008.” Health Aff 28:w1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another significant criticism of the private system is that it ends up being more costly than publicly funded systems. In 2001 the United States government spent $4,887 per person on health care.  That is more than double the rate of any other [[w:G8|G8]] country, except Japan which spends close to $2,627 per capita annually.  Considering private insurers are supposed to cover the majority of health care costs in the U.S., it is somewhat surprising that the United States spends a greater fraction of its national budget on health than Canada, Germany, France, or Japan.  One explanation for the higher health care costs in the U.S. is the billing approach: in the U.S., many doctors work on a fee-for-service basis, which means they earn more if they do more tests or are consulted more frequently.  In contrast, doctors who are salaried have no financial incentive to perform unnecessary tests.  This was the explanation given for the wide disparity in Medicare spending for patients in the last two years of their lives at top teaching hospitals: per patient costs at UCLA were $93,000, but only $53,000 at the Mayo Clinic.  When doctors are salaried, they are not inclined to perform unnecessary tests just to increase their income, which is what doctors using fee-for-service approaches do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wennberg2008&quot;&gt;Wennberg, John E., Elliott S. Fisher, David C. Goodman, Jonathan S. Skinner, and Sandra M. Sharp. 2008. Tracking the Care of Patients with Severe Chronic Illness: The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 2008. Lebanon, New Hampshire: The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice http://web.archive.org/web/20090325003539/http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/atlases/2008_Chronic_Care_Atlas.pdf (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The quality of care and patient life expectancy did not differ between these two hospitals, despite the substantial difference in costs.
*Most experts believe that significant [[w:market failure|market failure]] occurs in health markets, thereby leading free market insurance models to operate inefficiently.  The consumers of health care are vastly less knowledgeable than the medical professionals they buy it from. An individual is especially less likely to make rational choices about his/her own health care in a case of emergency.  The extreme importance of health matters to the consumer adds to the problem of the information gap.  This gives the medical profession the ability to set rates that are well above free market value.  The need to ensure competence and qualifications among medical professionals also means that they are inevitably closely controlled by professional associations that can exert [[w:monopoly|monopolistic]] control over prices.  Monopolies are made even more likely by the sheer variety of specialists and the importance of geographic proximity.  Patients in most markets have no more than one or two heart specialists or brain surgeons to choose from, making competition for patients between such experts very limited.
*In theory when a government sets billing rates it can negotiate with the professional societies with equal heft and knowledge, reaching a total cost that is closer to the ideal than an unregulated market.  In private insurance systems, each insurance company is responsible for negotiating its own salaries. A possible result of this approach is the higher pay in doctors' salaries.  Doctors' salaries do tend to be much lower in public systems.  For instance, doctors' salaries in the United States are twice those in Canada.
*The private insurance or free-market approach also fails to provide an efficient delivery for health care because prevention is such an essential component, but one that most people misjudge.  Screening for diseases such as cancer saves both lives and money, but there is a tendency within the general population to not correctly assess their risk of disease and thus to not have regular check ups.  Many people are only willing to pay a doctor when they are sick, even though this care may be far more expensive than regular preventative care would have been.  Delaying treatment until the condition is too severe to be treated can result, often with serious and lamentable consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman2008&quot;&gt;Krugman, Paul. 2008. “Health Care Horror Stories.” The New York Times, April 11 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/opinion/11krugman.html (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The one exception is when extensive publicity, such as that for [[w:mammogram|mammograms]], is undertaken.  Making regular appointments cheaper, or even free (as is done in public systems), has been shown to reduce both rates of illness and costs of health care.  Conversely, placing the cost of a visit to a general practitioner too low will lead to excessive visits wasting both a patient's and a doctor's time.  Thus while some experts believe free doctor visits produce ideal results, most believe that forcing people to pay some fraction of the cost of an appointment is better.
*When a claim is made, particularly for a sizeable amount, the use of paperwork and bureaucracy can allow insurance companies to avoid payment of the claim or, at a minimum, greatly delay it.  Some people simply give up pursuing their claims with their insurance provider. This is a cost-cutting technique employed by some companies; fighting claims legally is actually less expensive in some instances than paying the claims outright.  
*Insurance companies usually do not announce their health insurance premiums more than one year in advance.  This means that, if one becomes ill, he or she may find that the premiums have greatly increased.  This largely defeats the purpose of having insurance in the eyes of many.  However, this is not a concern in many group health plans because there are often laws that prevent companies from charging a single individual in the plan more than others who are enrolled in the same insurance plan.
*Health insurance is often only widely available at a reasonable cost through an employer-sponsored group plan.  This means that unemployed individuals and self-employed individuals are at an extreme disadvantage and will have to pay for more for their health care. 
*Experimental treatments or particularly expensive drugs are often not covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata2008&quot;&gt;Kolata, Gina. 2008. “Co-Payments Soar for Drugs With High Prices.” The New York Times, April 14 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/us/14drug.html (Accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is especially criticized by those who have already tried, and not benefited from, all ''standard'' medical treatments.  Because insurance companies can avoid paying claims for experimental procedures, this has lead some insurers to claim that procedures are still ''experimental'' well after they have become standard medical practice.  This phenomenon was especially prevalent among private insurance companies after [[w:organ transplants|organ transplants]], particularly kidney transplants, first became standard medical practice, due to the tremendous costs associated with this procedure and other organ transplantation. This approach to avoiding paying premiums can also undermine medical advances.
*[[w:Health Maintenance Organization|Health Maintenance Organizations]] or (HMO) types of health insurance are often criticized for excessive cost-cutting policies that include accountants or other administrators making medical decisions for customers. Rather than allowing such decisions to be made by health care professionals who know which procedures or treatments are necessary, these health plan administrators are dictating medical practice through their refusal to cover claims.
*As the health care recipient is not directly involved in payment of health care services and products, they are less likely to scrutinize or negotiate the costs of the health care they receive. To care providers (health care professionals, not the insurers), insured care recipients are viewed as customers with relatively limitless financial resources who do not consider the prices of services. To address this concern, many insurers have implemented a program of bill review in which insured individuals are allowed to challenge items on a bill (particularly an inpatient hospital bill) as being for goods or services ''not received''. If a challenge is proven accurate, insured individuals are awarded with a percentage of the amount that the insurer would have otherwise paid for this disputed item or service.

Concerns about health insurance are prevalent in the United States.  A June 2005 survey of a random national sample by the [[w:Kaiser Family Foundation|Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that twice as many Americans are more worried about rising health care costs than losing their job or being the victim of a terrorist attack ([http://my.webmd.com/content/Article/108/108740.htm source]). Healthcare changes in the United States, however, are typically rife with conflict, slow to progress, and dominated by concerns about profits rather than patients, which often leads to a highly fractured and conflict-oriented approach with little room for significant changes except over vast periods of time (see debates surrounding [[w: Social Security|Social Security]], the [[w: Hill-Burton Act|Hill-Burton Act]], the [[w: EMTALA|EMTALA]], and the [[w: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] for examples.

===Publicly Funded Health Care===
An alternative to private health insurance and the free-market approach to health care is publicly funded health care.  Publicly funded medicine is health care that is paid wholly or mostly by public funds (i.e., [[w:tax|taxes]]). Publicly funded medicine is often referred to as ''socialized medicine'' by its opponents, whereas supporters of this approach tend to use the terms ''universal healthcare'', ''single payer healthcare'', or ''[[w:National Health Service|National Health Services]]''. It is seen as a key part of a [[w:welfare state|welfare state]]. 

[[File:Universal_health_care.svg|thumb|center|800px|58 countries with universal health care in 2009.]]

This approach to health care is the most common and popular among developed (and developing) nations around the world today. The majority of [[w:developed country|developed nations]] have publicly funded health systems that cover the great majority of the population. For some examples, see the [[w:British National Health Service|British National Health Service]], [[w:medicare (Canada)|medicare Canada]] and  [[w:Medicare (Australia)|medicare Australia]].  

Even among countries that have publicly funded medicine, different countries have different approaches to the funding and provision of medical services.  Some areas of difference are whether the system will be funded from general government revenues (e.g. Italy, Canada) or through a government social security system (France, Japan, Germany) on a separate budget and funded with special separate taxes.  Another difference is how much of the cost of care will be paid for by government or social security system, in Canada all hospital care is paid for by the government while in Japan patients must pay 10 to 30% of the cost of a hospital stay. What will be covered by the public system is also important; for instance, the Belgian government pays the bulk of the fees for dental and eye care, while the Australian government covers neither. 

The United States has been virtually alone among developed nations in not maintaining a publicly-funded health-care system since South Africa adopted a publicly-funded system after toppling its [[w:apartheid|apartheid]] regime.  However, a few states in the U.S. have taken serious steps toward achieving this goal, most notably Minnesota.  Other states, while not attempting to insure all of their residents strictly speaking, cover large numbers of people by reimbursing hospitals and other health-care providers using what is generally characterized as a [[w:charity care|charity care]] scheme, which often includes levies. A 2007 New York Times/CBS Poll found that a majority of Americans support some form of universal healthcare (59%), and just as many Americans support it even if it means raising their taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toner2007&quot;&gt;Toner, R., &amp; Elder, J. (2007). Most Support U.S. Guarantee of Health Care. The New York Times. Retrieved March 2, 2007, from http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/02/washington/02poll.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Support is mixed between Democrats, Republicans, and Independents: 63% of Democrats support universal healthcare, 49% of Independents do, and 30% of Republicans do.

Publicly funded medicine may be administered and provided by the [[w:government|government]], but in some systems that is not an obligation: there exist systems where medicine is publicly funded, yet most health providers are private entities.  The organization providing public health insurance is not necessarily a public administration, and its budget may be isolated from the main state budget.  Likewise, some systems do not necessarily provide universal healthcare, nor restrict coverage to public health facilities.

Proponents of publicly funded medicine cite several advantages over private insurance or free-market approaches to health care: 
*Publicly funded approaches provide universal access to health care to all citizens, resulting in equality in matters of life and death.
*Publicly funded health care reduces contractual paperwork.
*Publicly funded health care facilitates the creation of uniform standards of care.  
*Publicly funded health care may help reduce illnesses associated with job loss.  As many people in the US rely on their jobs for health insurance, losing their jobs increases stress and, as a result, increases illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strully2009&quot;&gt;Strully, K. W. (2009). “Job Loss and Health in the U.S. Labor Market.” Demography 46(2):&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is also the case that publicly funded systems result in a reduction in the percentage of societal resources devoted to medical care; meaning public systems cost less than private systems.

Publicly funded health care is not without its criticisms.  Some purported disadvantages of the public system include:
*Some critics argue there is a greater likelihood of lower quality health care than privately funded systems. However, because of the universal accessibility of health care, this claim is generally not true.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks2006&quot;/&gt;
*Another criticism of publicly funded health care is that there is less motivation for medical innovation and invention and less motivation for society's most skilled people to become doctors, because of the lower amount of monetary compensation.
*Price no longer influences the allocation of resources, thus removing a natural self-corrective mechanism for avoiding waste and inefficiency (though the redundancy of the private system - competing insurers - often results in more inefficiency than a single, public system).
*Health care workers' pay is often not related to quality or speed of care.  Thus very long waits can occur before care is received.
*Because publicly funded medicine is a form of [[w:socialism|socialism]], many of the general concerns about socialism can be applied to this approach.
*People are afraid that they can't choose their own doctor. The state chooses for them. This also tends to be an over-exaggerated and ill-founded concern as there is some degree of freedom in choosing medical practitioners in public systems.

===Parallel Public/Private Systems===
Almost every country that has a publicly funded health care system also has a parallel private system, generally catering to the wealthy.  While the goal of public systems is to provide equal service, the [[w:egalitarianism|egalitarianism]] tends to be closer to ''partial egalitarianism''.  Every nation either has parallel private providers or its citizens are free to travel to a nation that does, so there is effectively a [[w:two-tier healthcare|two-tier healthcare]] system that reduces the [[w:social equality|equality]] of service.  Since private providers are typically better paid, those medical professionals motivated by remunerative concerns migrate to the private sector while the private hospitals also get newer and better equipment and facilities.  A number of countries such as Australia attempt to solve the problem of unequal care by insisting that doctors divide their time between public and private systems.

Proponents of these parallel private systems argue that they are necessary to provide flexibility to the system and are a way to increase funding for the health care system as a whole by charging the wealthy more.  Opponents believe that they are allowed to exist mainly because politicians and their friends are wealthy and would prefer better care. They also argue that all citizens should have access to high quality healthcare.  The only country not to have any form of parallel private system for basic health care is Canada.  However, wealthy Canadians can and travel to the United States for care.  

Also, in some cases, doctors are so well paid in both systems that prestige is often more important to them than remuneration.  This is very much the case in the United Kingdom where private medicine is seen as less prestigious than public medicine by much of the population.  As a result, the best doctors tend to spend the majority of their time working for the public system, even though they may also do some work for private healthcare providers.  The British in particular tend to use private healthcare to avoid waiting lists rather than because they believe that they will receive better care from it.

===Difficulties of analysis===
Cost-benefit analysis of healthcare is extremely difficult to do accurately, or to separate from emotional entanglement. For instance, prevention of smoking or obesity is presented as having the potential to save the costs of treating illnesses arising from those choices. Yet, if those illnesses are fatal or life shortening, they may reduce the eventual cost to the system of treating that person through the rest of their life, and it is possible that they will die of an illness every bit as expensive to treat as the ones they avoided by a healthy lifestyle. 

This has to be balanced against the loss of taxation or insurance revenue that might come should a person have a longer productive (i.e. working and tax or insurance-paying) life. The cost-benefit analysis will be very different depending on whether you adopt a whole-life accounting, or consider each month as debits and credits on an insurance system. In a system financed by taxation, the greatest cost benefit comes from preserving the working life of those who are likely to pay the most tax in the future, i.e. the young and rich. 

Few politicians would dare to present the big picture of costs in this way, because they would be condemned as callous. Nevertheless, behind the scenes, a responsible government must be performing cost analysis in order to balance its budget; it is not likely, however, to take the most purely cost effective route. It may choose to provide the ''best'' health care according to some other model, but the cost of this still must be estimated and funded, and there is no uncontroversial definition of ''best''.

In producing a definition of quality of healthcare, there is an implication that quality can be measured. In fact, the effectiveness of healthcare is extremely difficult to measure, not only because of medical uncertainty, but because of intangible quantities like ''quality of life''. This is likely to lead to systems that measure ''only'' what is easy to measure (such as length of life, waiting times or infection rates).   As a result, the importance of treating chronic, but non-fatal conditions, or of providing the best care for the terminally ill may be reduced. Thus, it is possible for personal satisfaction with the system to go down, while metrics go up.

==Behavior and Environmental Influences on Health==
The following sections explore some of the ways behaviors and environment can impact human health.

===Smoking===
The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] describes tobacco use as &quot;the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide&quot; ([http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit/canquit.htm source]). A person's increased risk of contracting disease is directly proportional to the length of time that a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked.  However, if someone stops smoking the risks of developing diseases steadily decline, although gradually, as the damage to their body is repaired.

The main health risks from tobacco smoking pertain to diseases of the cardiovascular system, in particular smoking is a major risk factor for: [[w:myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction]] (heart attack); diseases of the [[w:Respiratory system|respiratory tract]], such as [[w:Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]] (COPD) and [[w:emphysema|emphysema]]; and [[w:cancer|cancer]], particularly [[w:lung cancer|lung cancer]] and cancers of the [[w:larynx|larynx]] and [[w:tongue|tongue]]. Prior to [[w:World War I|World War I]], lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, one most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.

===Alcohol===
'''Alcoholism''' is a dependency on alcohol characterized by craving (a strong need to drink), loss of control (being unable to stop drinking despite a desire to do so), physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, and tolerance (increasing difficulty of becoming drunk).

Although acceptance of the ''[[w:American Disease Model|American Disease Model]]'' is not without controversy, the [[w:American Medical Association|American Medical Association]], the [[w:American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association]], the [[w:American Hospital Association|American Hospital Association]], the [[w:American Public Health Association|American Public Health Association]], the [[w:National Association of Social Workers|National Association of Social Workers]], the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]], and the [[w:American College of Physicians|American College of Physicians]] have all classified alcoholism as a [[w:disease|disease]].

In a 1992 [[w:JAMA|JAMA]] article, the [[w:Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] and the [[w:American Society of Addiction Medicine|American Society of Addiction Medicine]] published this definition for alcoholism: &quot;Alcoholism is a primary chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. The disease is often progressive and fatal. It is characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, mostly denial. Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic.&quot;

Symptoms of a person's dependence on alcohol may include, but are not limited to, a feeling of necessity in regards to consumption of alcohol, or an inability to resist alcohol if offered. Though these symptoms often arise from a physical dependence on the substance, it is not uncommon for individuals, especially teenagers and adolescents between the ages of fifteen and twenty, to rely on alcohol as a means of social interaction. If a person cannot refuse alcohol in the presence of others, insists on drinking alcohol excessively for fear of alienation and neglect, or feels they cannot socially interact with others unless under the influence then this person is considered socially dependent on the substance. These traits can be noticed in individuals who relocate (such as students attending a new university) whereby an individual with no past history of alcohol consumption begins to consume alcohol in order to associate and relate to others. Social dependence, though not physically threatening in early stages, can lead to physical dependence if the person cannot control their urges and more so their reasons for drinking.

The causes for alcohol abuse and dependence cannot be easily explained, but the long-standing, unscientific prejudice that alcoholism is the result of moral or ethical weakness on the part of the sufferer has been largely altered. Recent polls show that 90% of Americans currently believe that alcoholism is, in fact, a [[w:disease|disease]] (source?). Of the two thirds of the North American population who consume alcohol, 10% are alcoholics and 6% consume more than half of all alcohol. Stereotypes of alcoholics are often found in fiction and [[w:popular culture|popular culture]].  In modern times, the recovery movement has led to more realistic portraits of alcoholics and their problems.

The social problems arising from alcoholism can include loss of employment, financial problems, marital conflict and divorce, convictions for crimes such as drunk driving or public disorder, loss of accommodation, and loss of respect from others who may see the problem as self-inflicted and easily avoided.  Exhaustive studies, including those by author [[w:Wayne Kritsberg|Wayne Kritsberg]], show that alcoholism affects not only the addicted but can profoundly impact the family members around them.  Children of alcoholics can be affected even after they are grown.  This condition is usually referred to as ''The Adult Children of Alcoholics Syndrome''. [[w:Al-Anon|Al-Anon]], a group modelled after [[w:Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous]], offers aid to friends and family members of alcoholics.

====Moderate Drinking====
Of course, not everyone who consumes alcohol is an alcoholic or is at danger of becoming an alcoholic.  In fact, there is some debate as to whether there are some benefits derived from moderate consumption of alcohol. The controversy over moderate drinking is an ongoing debate about the claimed benefit or harm to human health from moderate consumption of [[w:alcoholic beverage|alcoholic beverages]]. Moderate consumption typically means the consumption of 1 to 3 drinks of an alcoholic beverage a day; the number varies with age and gender. There is wide consensus that over-drinking is harmful: [[w:ethanol|alcohol]] damages human cells and organs such as the [[w:brain|brain]], [[w:liver|liver]] and [[w:kidney|kidney]]. 

Many studies show that consumers of up to 3 drinks a day have a 10% to 40% lower risk of [[w:coronary heart disease|coronary heart disease]] than those who abstain. Rimm ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Rimm1999&quot;&gt;Rimm, E B, P Williams, K Fosher, M Criqui, and M J Stampfer. 1999. “Moderate alcohol intake and lower risk of coronary heart disease: meta-analysis of effects on lipids and haemostatic factors.” BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) 319:1523-1528.&lt;/ref&gt; predict a 24.7% decrease in the risk of coronary heart disease based upon 30g alcohol/day. 

Critics of moderate drinking claim that any benefits are far outweighed by the possible consequences of over consumption and that these benefits can be had by less risky means. Scientists also note that studies supporting the benefits of moderate drinking do not control for other factors, such as lifestyle differences between moderate drinkers and nondrinkers. There is evidence that moderate drinkers are more affluent than nondrinkers and as such lead lifestyles that are more conducive to good health in general.

Research on the effects of moderate drinking is in its early stages. No long term studies have been done and control groups would be difficult to establish because of the many variables. The current medical recommendation&lt;ref name=&quot;Abdulla1997&quot;&gt;Abdulla, S. 1997. “Is alcohol really good for you?.” Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 90:651.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding being a moderate drinker is that it is &quot;not only meaningless but also irresponsible&quot; to become a moderate drinker if you don't already drink given that the many obvious health hazards of alcohol outweigh &quot;the benefits of alcohol [which] are small and ill-understood&quot; particularly when so many other cardiovascular treatments are available (p. 651).

====Effects of Fetal Alcohol Exposure====
Fetal alcohol exposure is regarded by researchers as the leading known cause of mental and physical birth defects, surpassing both [[w:spina bifida|spina bifida]] and [[w:Down syndrome|Down syndrome]], producing more severe abnormalities than [[w:heroin|heroin]], [[w:cocaine|cocaine]], or [[w:marijuana|marijuana]], and is the most common preventable cause of birth defects in the United States ([http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/brain/fas.html source]). 

It can cause [[w:mental retardation|mental retardation]], facial deformities, stunted physical and emotional development, behavioral problems, [[w:memory|memory]] deficiencies, attention deficits, impulsiveness, an inability to reason from cause to effect; a failure to comprehend the concept of time; and an inability to tell reality from fantasy. Secondary disabilities develop over time because of problems fitting into the environment.

Researchers believe that the risk is highest early in the pregnancy, but there are risks throughout because the fetus' brain develops throughout the entire pregnancy. No amount of alcohol, during any trimester, is absolutely safe.

===Obesity===
[[Image:VenusWillendorf.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Venus of Willendorf]]

'''Obesity''' is a condition in which the natural energy reserve of humans, which is stored in [[w:adipose tissue|fat tissue]], is expanded far beyond usual levels to the point where it impairs health. While cultural and scientific definitions of obesity are subject to change, it is accepted that excessive body weight predisposes to various forms of disease, particularly [[w:cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disease]].

There is continuous debate over obesity, at several levels. The [[w:evidence based medicine|scientific evidence]] informing these debates is more contradictory than most simple arguments assume. Statistics demonstrating correlations are typically misinterpreted in public discussion as demonstrating causation, a fallacy known as the [[w:spurious relationship|spurious relationship]].

In several human cultures, obesity is (or has been) associated with attractiveness, strength, and fertility. Some of the earliest known cultural artifacts, known as [[w:Venus of Willendorf|Venuses]], are pocket-sized statuettes representing an obese female figure. Although their cultural significance is unrecorded, their widespread use throughout pre-historic Mediterranean and European cultures suggests a central role for the obese female form in magical rituals and implies cultural approval of (and perhaps reverence for) this body form. 

Obesity functions as a symbol of wealth and success in cultures prone to food scarcity. Well into the early modern period in European cultures, it still served this role. Contemporary cultures which approve of obesity, to a greater degree than European and Western cultures, include African, Arabic, Indian, and Pacific Island cultures.  The implication of these cultural variations in attitudes toward obesity is that ideal body shape is culturally relative.  Another illustration of this is the finding that feminists are less likely to consider &quot;ultra-thin&quot; the ideal body image than non-feminists, indicating the culture and philosophy of feminism countermands the effects of popular media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swami2008&quot;&gt;Swami, Viren, Natalie Salem, Adrian Furnham, and Martin J. Tovee. 2008. “The influence of feminist ascription on judgements of women's physical attractiveness.” Body Image.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western cultures, obesity has come to be seen more as a medical condition than as a social statement. 

Various stereotypes of obese people have found their way into expressions of popular culture. A common stereotype is the obese character who has a warm and dependable personality, presumedly in compensation for social exclusion, but equally common is the obese vicious [[w:bullying|bully]]. [[w:Gluttony|Gluttony]] and obesity are commonly depicted together in works of fiction. It can be argued that depiction in popular culture adds to and maintains commonly perceived stereotypes, in turn harming the [[w:self esteem|self esteem]] of obese people. A charge of prejudice and/or discrimination on the basis of appearance could be leveled against these depictions.

[[File:Obese by state-2007.png|thumb|center|800px|This is a map showing the percentage of individuals by state who were overweight or obese in 2007.]]

====Causes of Obesity====
Conventional wisdom holds that obesity is caused by over-indulgence in fatty or sugary foods, portrayed as either a failure of will power or a species of addiction. Various specialists strongly oppose this view. For example, Professor [[w:Thomas Sanders|Thomas Sanders]], the director of the Nutrition, Food &amp; Health Research Centre at [[w:King's College London|King's College London]], emphasises the need for balance between activity and consumption:

:''In trials, there is no evidence suggesting that reducing fat intake has an effect on obesity. As long as your expenditure equals what you eat, you won't put on weight, regardless of how high the fat content is in your diet'' (''[[w:The Times|The Times]]'', London, 10 March 2004).

Obesity is generally a result of a combination of factors:
*[[w:Genetic|Genetic]] predisposition
*Energy-rich [[w:diet (nutrition)|diet]]
*Limited exercise and sedentary lifestyle
*[[w:Weight cycling|Weight cycling]], caused by repeated attempts to lose weight by dieting
*Underlying illness
*Certain [[w:eating disorders|eating disorders]]
*Poverty

Some eating disorders can lead to obesity, especially [[w:binge eating disorder|binge eating disorder]] (BED). As the name indicates, patients with this disorder are prone to overeat, often in binges. A proposed mechanism is that the eating serves to reduce anxiety, and some parallels with substance abuse can be drawn. An important additional factor is that BED patients often lack the ability to recognize hunger and satisfaction, something that is normally learned in childhood. [[w:Learning theory (education)|Learning theory]] suggests that early childhood conceptions may lead to an association between food and a calm mental state.

[[Image:PrevalenceOverweightAge6-19.GIF|right|thumb|400px|Increase in Overweight among US Children and Adolescents.]]

While it is often quite obvious why a certain individual gets fat, it is far more difficult to understand why the average weight of certain societies have recently been growing. While genetic causes are central to who is obese, they cannot explain why one culture grows fatter than another. Although there is no definitive explanation for the recent epidemic of obesity, an [[w:evolution|evolutionary]] hypothesis offers one explanation. In times when food was scarce, the ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance and use such abundance by storing energy efficiently was likely an evolutionary advantage.  This is precisely the opposite of what is required in a sedentary society, where high-energy food is available in abundant quantities in the context of decreased exercise. Although many people may have a genetic propensity towards obesity, it is only with the reduction in physical activity and a move towards high-calorie diets of modern societies that it has become so widespread.

An alternative to an evolutionary hypothesis is an inequality hypothesis. In most developed nations, there are massive food surpluses, but these surpluses do not apply uniformly across populations.  Similarly, sedentary lifestyles are not evenly distributed, and many of the populations experiencing increasing levels of obesity are rather active compared to other groups with lower levels of obesity.  Even in the most developed nations, the people most likely to develop obesity tend to have the lowest access to quality foods and many of them spend considerable time being active due to work and/or family requirements.  As a result, evolutionary hypotheses would suggest these people would take advantage of rare periods of abundance without developing obesity due to their lower levels of average consumption and moderate levels of activity.  The opposite, however, is what occurs.  Seeking to explain this phenomenon, researchers focused on neighborhood effects have systematically demonstrated that poverty is a more likely explanation for obesity.  Specifically, people in impoverished areas often lack access to food available to more economically well off members of society, often only have access to foods that can lead to obesity (due to their high-calorie contents) within their neighborhoods (even if they maintain active lifestyles or working lives), and often lack access to many of the resources (e.g., stoves, cooking utensils, transportation to healthier grocery stores, electricity, etc.) necessary for taking advantage of food surpluses.  While proponents of evolutionary hypotheses point to individualistic elements like exercise, genetics, diet selection, and sedentary lifestyles that suggest we may improve health without drastically altering our current economic, political, and health systems, proponents of social explanations (such as poverty and environmental pollution) note that even when researchers and advocates have found ways to minimize these individualistic elements (e.g., via food programs, dietary education protocols, exercise programs, limited or temporary economic support, and genetic interventions) the patterns of obesity have not changed much.  As a result, these researchers hypothesize that obesity (and other health-related epidemics that have become common in the last couple hundred years) can only be understood (and thus combatted) by examining the social factors that may contribute to physiological, biological, genetic, and other health-related transformations, adaptations, and mutations within the bodies of people experiencing said social factors and shifts within our natural surroundings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Link2010&quot;&gt;Link, Bruce G. and Jo Phelan. 2010. “Social Conditions as Fundamental Causes of Health Inequalities.” Pp. 3−17 in Handbook of Medical Sociology, 6th Edition, edited by C. Bird, P. Conrad, A. Fremont, and S. Timmermans. Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosich2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burdette2008&quot;&gt;Burdette, Amy and Terrence Hill. 2008. “An examination of processes linking perceived neighborhood disorder and obesity.” Social Science &amp; Medicine 67:38-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, the obesity epidemic is most notable in the United States. In the years from just after the Second World War until 1960 the average person's weight increased, but few were obese. In 1960 almost the entire white population was well fed, but not overweight. In the two and a half decades since 1980 the growth in the rate of obesity has accelerated markedly (while mirroring the growth in poverty and food insecurity rates) and is increasingly becoming a [[w:public health|public health]] concern. There are a number of theories as to the cause of this change since 1980, but most echo assumptions embedded within initial evolutionary hypotheses at present (and rely merely on assumptions that specific correlations are related to the fundamental cause of the issue), and thus may need to be readjusted in relation to emerging recognition of the limitations of these theories: 
*Obese people appear to be less active in general than lean people, and not just because of their obesity. A controlled increase in calorie intake of lean people did not make them less active, nor, correspondingly, when obese people lost weight did they become more active. Weight change does not affect activity levels, but the converse seems to be the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine2005&quot;&gt;Levine JA, Lanningham-Foster LM, McCrady SK, Krizan AC, Olson LR, Kane PH, Jensen MD, Clark MM. ''Interindividual variation in posture allocation: possible role in human obesity.'' Science 2005;307:584-6. PMID 15681386.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another important contributor to the current obesity concern is the much lower relative cost of foodstuffs: agricultural [[w:subsidy|subsidies]] in the United States and Europe have led to lower food prices for consumers than at any other point in history.  
*Marketing may also play a role.  In the early 1980s the [[w:Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration lifted most regulations for advertising to children. As a result, the number of commercials seen by the average child increased greatly, and a large proportion of these were for [[w:fast food|fast food]] and [[w:candy|candy]]. There is now compelling evidence that children's exposure to food commercials on television increases the odds of childhood obesity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmerman2010&quot;&gt;Zimmerman, Frederick J., and Janice F. Bell. 2010. “Associations of Television Content Type and Obesity in Children.” Am J Public Health 100:334-340.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Changes in the price of [[w:gasoline|gasoline]] may also have had an effect, as unlike during the 1970s it is now affordable in the United States to drive everywhere, curtailing both foot traffic and the riding of bikes. An indication of the reliance on cars in the U.S. is the increasing number of areas that are built without sidewalks and parks.
*Increases in the service sector of the economy have resulted in a greater percentage of the population spending most of their workday behind a desk or computer.  
*A social cause that is believed by many to play a role is the increasing number of ''two income households'' where one parent no longer remains home to look after the house. This increases the number of restaurant and take-out meals.
*Urban sprawl may also contribute to the increase in obesity rates, possibly due to less walking and less time for cooking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez2004&quot;&gt;Lopez R. ''Urban sprawl and risk for being overweight or obese.'' Am J Publ Health 2004;94:1574-9. PMID 15333317.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Since 1980 both sit-in and fast food restaurants have seen dramatic growth in terms of the number of outlets and customers served.  Low food costs and intense competition for market share led to increased portion sizes. For example, [[w:McDonalds|McDonalds']] french fries portions rose from 200 calories in 1960 to over 600 calories today.
*Increasing [[w:affluence|affluence]] itself may be a cause or contributing factor since obesity tends to flourish as a [[w:diseases of affluence|disease of affluence]] in countries which are developing and becoming westernised (for more information on this factor, see [http://www.iotf.org/ here)]. This is supported by the observation of a dip in American GDP after 1990, the year of the [[w:Gulf War|Gulf War]], followed by an exponential increase. U.S. obesity statistics followed the same pattern, offset by two years ([http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ source]).

Some obesity co-factors are resistant to the theory that the ''epidemic'' is a new phenomenon. In particular, a [[w:social class|class]] co-factor consistently appears across many studies. Comparing net worth with BMI scores, one study found obese American subjects were approximately half as wealthy as thin ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zagorsky2005&quot;&gt;Zagorsky, Jay L. 2005. “Health and Wealth. The Late-20th Century Obesity Epidemic in the U.S.” Economics and Human Biology 3(2):296–313.&lt;/ref&gt; When income differentials were factored out, the inequity persisted: thin subjects were inheriting more wealth than fat ones. Another study finds women who married into a higher status were thinner than women who married into lower status.  Like many other recent analyses of social patterning within obese and non-obese populations, these studies suggest that while evolutionary hypotheses provided an important starting point, the answers to the problems likely lie either elsewhere or via an integration of evolutionary and fundamental causes theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Link2010&quot;/&gt;

====Policy Responses to Obesity====
On top of controversies about the causes of obesity, and about its precise health implications, come controversies about the correct [[w:policy|policy]] approach to obesity. The main debate is between ''personal responsibility'' advocates, who resist regulatory attempts to intervene in citizen's private dietary habits, and ''public interest'' advocates, who promote regulations on the same public health grounds as the restrictions applied to tobacco products. Importantly, these suggestions are (thus far) primarily tied to evolutionary hypotheses, which suggests that they are more likely to influence individual cases and less likely to greatly effect the overall patterns.  There is some evidence that the public interest approach may help, though it is clearly not the solution to the problem, and many activists worry that it will - like anti-smoking campaigns - ultimately become an attempt to limit the liberty and decision-making options for people rather than simply address the problems associated with consumption behaviors.  A recent study found that parents order items for their children from fast food menus that total to just over 100 fewer calories when each item's calories are clearly labeled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tandon2010&quot;&gt;Tandon, Pooja S., Jeffrey Wright, Chuan Zhou, Cara Beth Rogers, and Dimitri A. Christakis. 2010. “Nutrition Menu Labeling May Lead to Lower-Calorie Restaurant Meal Choices for Children.” Pediatrics peds.2009-1117.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that raising awareness and educating consumers about the calorie content may help reduce the number of calories consumed for those individuals that have the privilege (e.g., the economic, social, and educational resources) to be selective in their and their children's dietary selections.

In the U.S., a recent bout in this controversy involves the so-called [[w:Cheeseburger Bill|Cheeseburger Bill]], an attempt to indemnify food industry businesses from frivolous law suits by obese clients. On July 16, 2004, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officially classified obesity as a disease. Speaking to a Senate committee, [[w:Tommy Thompson|Tommy Thompson]], the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that Medicare would cover obesity-related health problems. However, reimbursement would not be given if a treatment was not proven to be effective.

==The Evolution of Health Care and Medicine==
All human societies have  beliefs that provide explanations for, and responses to, childbirth, death, and disease. Throughout the world, illness has often been attributed to [[w:witchcraft|witchcraft]], [[w:demons|demons]], or the will of the gods, ideas that retain some power within certain cultures and communities (see [[w:faith healing|faith healing]]). However, the rise of scientific medicine in the past two centuries has altered or replaced many historic health practices while granting others (regardless of their results at times) legitimacy in the public consciousness.

===Folk Medicine===
[[Image:Healer_street_vendor_in_Dhaka.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The man pictured here is a shaman or traditional healer in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.  He is selling various animal parts as cures.]]
Folk medicine refers collectively to procedures traditionally used for treatment of illness and injury, aid to childbirth, and maintenance of wellness. It is a body of knowledge distinct from modern, ''scientific medicine'' but may coexist in the same culture. It is usually unwritten and transmitted orally until someone ''collects'' it. Within a given culture, elements of folk medicine may be diffusely believed by many adults or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of [[w:healer|healer]], [[w:shaman|shaman]], [[w:midwife|midwife]], [[w:witch|witch]], or dealer in herbs. Elements in a specific culture are not necessarily integrated into a coherent system and may be contradictory. Folk medicine is sometimes associated with [[w:quackery|quackery]] when practiced as theatrics or otherwise practiced fraudulently, yet it may also preserve important cultural tradition from the past.  

Herbal medicine is an aspect of folk medicine that involves the use of gathered plant parts to make teas, [[w:poultice|poultices]], or powders that purportedly effect cures. Many effective treatments adopted by physicians over the centuries were derived from plants (e.g. aspirin), and botany was an important part of the ''materia medica'' of professional medical training before the 20th century.  Attention has been paid to the folk medicine of indigenous peoples of remote areas of the world in the interest of finding new pharmaceuticals. Of concern is the extinction of many species by the clearing of formerly wild rainforests. Such activity may lead to the loss of species of plants that could provide aids to modern medicine. Attitudes toward this type of knowledge gathering and plant preservation vary and political conflicts have increasingly arisen over ''ownership'' of the plants, land, and knowledge in several parts of the world.

While potentially important as cultural tradition, folk medicine should not be considered a reliable or proven form of healthcare; anyone considering trying folk medicine should always consult with a scientifically trained doctor first while exploring ways that folk medicine may aid, enhance, or provide better options than scientifically based approaches (e.g., the herbs at the heart of aspirin use do not come with the same side-effects and potential blood and heart issues in later life that aspirin has).

===Alternative Medicine===
'''Alternative medicine''' describes methods and practices used in place of, or in addition to, [[w:medicine|conventional]] or scientific treatments.  There is some debate as to what is included under the label &quot;alternative,&quot; as these practices include things as far ranging as: spiritual, metaphysical, or religious treatments; Eastern and Asian traditional treatments; and a variety of unproven treatments, like [[w:acupuncture|acupuncture]], [[w:chiropractic|chiropractic]], [[w:healing-touch|healing-touch]], and [[w:homeopathy|homeopathy]].  One popular definition of alternative medicine is provided by [[w:Richard Dawkins|Richard Dawkins]], an Oxford biologist: &quot;that set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested or consistently fail tests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins2003&quot;&gt;Dawkins, Richard in Snake Oil, and Other Preoccupations by John Diamond. 2003. http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/writings/snakeoil.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  

The widespread acceptance of various forms of alternative medicine is a good illustration of a combination of social-psychological ideas, including: [[w:fads|fads]], [http://www.aaas.org/spp/scifree/articles/102700.shtml scientific illiteracy], the power of marketing in a capitalistic economy, the influence of misinformed politicians on public policy [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html e.g., The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health] and the willingness of people without &quot;alternatives&quot; to turn to unproven therapies when modern medicine informs them [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/quacksell.html there is nothing else that can be done].  Importantly, these same processes often facilitate the practice of newfound scientific approaches to medicine before researchers know exactly what such treatments and pills may do to human beings over the life course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiefer2006&quot;&gt;Tiefer, Lenore. 2006. “The Viagra Phenomenon.” Sexualities 9:273-294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Busfield, Joan. 2006. “Pills, Power, People: Sociological Understandings of the Pharmaceutical Industry.” Sociology 40(2):297-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Medicine===
[[Image:Tahril-neonatal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Modern medicine has substantially improved quality of life around the world.]]

Healthcare improves as a result of some advancements in [[w:medical science|medical science]].  Western medicine approaches health care from two angles.  The first, the medical model, focuses on the eradication of illness through [[w:diagnosis|diagnosis]] and effective treatment. The second, the [[w:social model|social model]], focuses on changes that can be made in society and in people's own lifestyles to make the population healthier.  Western, scientific medicine has proven uniquely effective at treating and preventing some diseases while wholly inadequate in treating others.  It is increasingly widespread and more widely accepted than other forms of medicine, but researchers cannot ascertain whether this is due to results, concerted political and economic campaigns to stigmatize other approaches, or some combination of both.  Western medicine is notably secular in name, officially indifferent to ideas of the supernatural or the spirit, and officially concentrated on the body and society to determine causes and cures, but throughout history religious organizations and institutions (especially with corporate or economic backing) have exerted considerable influence upon much Western Scientific medical development and practice).  Despite its issues and problem areas, most researchers believe that Western scientific medicine is the most effective contributor to the health of humans in the world today.

====Criticisms of Alternative and Western Medicines====
Some of the criticisms of alternative and western-science medicine include:
*Lack of Western Science approved testing. Many of the studies allegedly supporting the claims of alternative medicine are not controlled, double-blind peer-reviewed experiments, which is considered the gold standard in science and modern medicine (but they are also often not paid for and controlled by for-profit companies, which occurs throughout Western Scientific Medicine).  The efficacy of these treatments has not been demonstrated through double-blind [[w:randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials]]. Where alternative methods provide temporary symptomatic relief, this can usually be explained as being due to the [[w:placebo effect|placebo effect]], to natural healing, or to the cyclical nature of some illnesses. 
*Not proven to be an alternative. The term ''alternative medicine'' is misleading, as these treatments have not been proven to be an effective alternative to regulated [[w:conventional medicine|conventional medicine]], but alternative medicine proponents point out that the same can be said (not proven, though often demonstrated to be probable) of Western Medicine.  
*Safety issues. Some ''alternative'' practices (like some Western medicine practices) have killed people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmsen2007&quot;&gt;Willmsen, Christine, and Michael J. Berens. 2007. “Public never warned about dangerous device.” The Seattle Times, November 19 http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004022178_miracle19m2.html (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Imrie2008&quot;&gt;Imrie, Robert. 2008. “Parents Pick Prayer Over Doctor, Girl Dies.” AOL News, March 28 http://news.aol.com/health/story/ar/_a/parents-pick-prayer-over-doctor-girl/20080327161309990002 (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  While not all alternative medicine treatments are potentially lethal, many are, and as a result, Western Medical authorities argue that Western Scientific standards must be applied to these medicines in the same way they are applied to many Western Medicine treatments that are lethal (once again, even though not all are).  The lack of oversight by government regulators like the Food and Drug Administration (similar to the lack of oversight it actually provides to the Western pharmaceutical industry&lt;ref name=&quot;Busfield2006&quot;&gt;Busfield, Joan. 2006. “Pills, Power, People: Sociological Understandings of the Pharmaceutical Industry.” Sociology 40(2):297-314.&lt;/ref&gt;) allows those selling these products virtually free-reign to employ whatever techniques they can sell (similar to lessened marketing regulations concerning pharmaceutical sales).  The result is a buyer beware situation in which consumers must discern whether the treatment is harmful regardless of whether such treatment comes from Alternative or Western medical traditions. Proponents of alternative medicine say that people should be free to choose whatever method of healthcare they want, and Western Medicine proponents make the same argument, but each group tends to highlight the benefits of their approach (for example, alternative approaches to birth and hemophilia) and western approaches to infectious disease and immune deficiency) without regard for their tradition's faults and controversies (for example, alternative approaches to pain relief that offered no herbal or pharmaceutical relief or western creation and treatment of diseases that likely did not exist - like hysteria, which was ultimately a response to gender inequality with little to no biological basis or consequence). Critics agree that people should be free to choose, but when choosing, people must be certain that whatever method they choose will be safe and effective. People who choose alternative or western medicines may think they are choosing a safe, effective medicine, while they may only be getting [[w:quackery|quack]] remedies. This issue is particularly important in the treatment of children and individuals whose capacity to evaluate the treatment is impaired.
*Delay in seeking conventional medical treatment. There is a concern that patients may delay seeking conventional medicine that could be more effective, while they undergo alternative therapies, potentially resulting in harm.  At the same time, there is concern that patients often avoid alternative medicines that could be more effective due to the stigmatization of alternative approaches in Western societies.  This is especially important - and part of the reason alternative and western approaches are being integrated in many settings - because human biology is incredibly complex, and often the answers to any condition require systematic comparison of multiple approaches and methods.  
*Poor diagnosis. Western and Alternative doctors and practitioners hold that the other tradition sometimes fail to correctly diagnose illnesses and therefore does not provide safe therapies.  With a minor illness this may not be a serious concern, but with more serious illness it can lead to [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/harmquack.html injury, disfigurement, or death].  In terms of alternative approaches, for example, the lack of vital monitoring practiced in some traditions may lead practitioners to miss important details concerning heart conditions, and in terms of western approaches, the emphasis on and history of dismissing women's concerns often leads to misdiagnosis of disorders due to focus upon the genital and reproductive organs. 
*Cost. In countries where healthcare is state-funded or funded by medical insurance, alternative therapies are often not covered, and must be paid for by the patient. Costs for some therapies are relatively inexpensive, just several dollars for a medication.  But others can be thousands of dollars and require continued payments for years and years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmsen2007&quot;/&gt;  Note, this is the same issue that faces the many people unable to acquire health insurance throughout the world.  
*Issues of regulation. Neither alternative or western medicines are properly regulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busfield2006&quot;/&gt; As a result, there is often little to no governmental control on who practices alternative medicine and no real way of knowing what training or expertise they possess.  In the United States, herbal remedies, vitamins, and supplements are not regulated by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody2008&quot;&gt;Brody, Jane E. 2008. “Potential for Harm in Dietary Supplements.” The New York Times, April 8 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/health/08brod.html (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CSPI2007&quot;&gt;“Memory Supplements Forgettable, Says CSPI.” http://www.cspinet.org/new/200705041.html (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that companies are not required to prove that these supplements are either effective or safe. The failure to regulate supplements has led to serious health issues for some, including some deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody2008&quot;/&gt;  Such problems did ultimately lead [http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/ephedra/december2003/ the FDA to ban the sale] of [[w:ephedra|ephedra]].  Similarly, there is often little to no governmental control over pharmaceutical research and practices, and much pharmaceutical (and other Western) medical research is subsidized by corporations in search of profits rather than health, which leaves patients with no real way of knowing whether or not their &quot;medicine&quot; is actually a good idea or simply an addition to the bottom line.  A notable example of this problem can be seen in western medical science approaches to [[w: breast cancer|breast cancer]] where - especially since the 1980's - corporate profits from the condition have exploded while treatment remains relatively the same as the 1940's approach (e.g., burn, slash and kill), where mammograms - supported by science funded by companies that create and sell mammography machines - and detection have become the focus to the detriment of attempts to compel researchers to search for cures and new treatment protocols, where billions of dollars are raised each year for research without any accountability concerning where this money goes, and where the most scientific answers to the problem itself (e.g., environmental factors that mirror rates of breast cancer in society since the 1930's) are completely ignored, unfunded, and left to private researchers to study.&lt;ref&gt;Sulik, Gayle.  2012.  Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering the amount of people that die each year from breast cancer related conditions or issues, the lack of oversight (and scientific ethics) in much of the Western Medical tradition (similar to alternative traditions) is quite astounding and powerful in its consequences.  
*Testing and studies. The western scientific community argues that many studies carried out by alternative medicine promoters are flawed, as they often use testimonials and [[w:hearsay|hearsay]] as evidence, leaving the results open to observer bias. They argue that the only way to counter observer bias is to run a double-blind experiment in which neither the patient nor the practitioner knows whether the real treatment is being given or if a [[w:placebo|placebo]] has been administered. This research should then be reviewed by peers to determine the validity of the research methodology. Testimonials are particularly disturbing in this regard because, by chance alone, some people may see some improvement in the ailment for which they are being treated and will proceed to testify that the method helped them when the method was not the true cause of improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beyerstein2008&quot;&gt;Beyerstein, Barry L. n.d. “Why Bogus Therapies Often Seem to Work.” quackwatch.org. http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altbelief.html (Accessed April 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Interestingly, promoters of Alternative Medicine levy the exact same complaint at the foot of western medical science - due to the pharmaceutical funding and oversight of most western &quot;experiments&quot;, the studies are automatically victims of observer bias in their construction in much the same way western scientists argue alternative medicine may be biased in their procedures.  For example, much breast cancer research and treatment science is funded by and subject to the funding of cosmetic companies that incidentally offer the products most highly correlated with breast cancer in America today (e.g., it is like having tobacco companies manage the scientific study of smoking - for a useful took where you can examine the cancer-causing content of your cosmetics see the recommended reading at the end of this section).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulik2012&quot;&gt;Sulik, Gayle.  2012.  Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyses across both fields often finds similar problematic procedures in both fields, but recent attempts to integrate (rather than demonize) these fields may be capable of reducing these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulik2012&quot;/&gt;

Recognizing the complexity of these issues, it is important for all people to learn about various aspects of health and well being, methods of critical thinking and decision making, and ways to keep abreast of ongoing developments within and between western-science and alternative medical traditions, practices, problems, benefits, and limitations.  In so doing, people may ascertain the best health-related practices for themselves and the people they care about while also pushing both of these medical traditions toward greater regulation, oversight, integration, and care practices for all people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Computational Physics is the study and implementation of numerical algorithm and the techniques which make calculations easy using computers.

== Purpose and Philosophy ==
The purpose of this course is demonstrate to students how computers can enable us to both broaden and deepen our understanding of physics by vastly increasing the range of mathematical calculations which we can conveniently perform.

Our approach to computational physics is to write self-contained programs in a high-level scientific language--i.e., either FORTRAN or C++. Of course, there are many other possible approaches, each with their own peculiar advantages and disadvantages. It is instructive to briefly examine the available options.

== Scientific Programming Methodology ==
Basically, there are three possible methods by which we could perform the numerical calculations which we are going to encounter during this course. 

First, we could use a mathematical software package, such as MATHEMATICA, MAPLE or MATLAB. The main advantage of these packages is that they facilitate the very rapid coding up of numerical problems. The main disadvantage is that they produce executable code which is interpreted, rather than compiled. Compiled code is translated directly from a high-level language into machine code instructions, which, by definition, are platform dependent--after all, an Intel x86 chip has a completely different instruction set to a Power-PC chip. Interpreted code is translated from a high-level language into a set of meta-code instructions which are platform independent. Each meta-code instruction is then translated into a fixed set of machine code instructions which is peculiar to the particular hardware platform on which the code is being run. In general, interpreted code is nowhere near as efficient, in terms of computer resource utilization, as compiled code: i.e., interpreted code run a lot slower than equivalent compiled code. Thus, although MATHEMATICA, MAPLE, and MATLAB are ideal environments in which to perform relatively small calculations, they are not suitable for full-blown research projects, since the code which they produce generally runs far too slowly. 

Second, we could write our own programs in a high-level language, but use calls to pre-written, pre-compiled routines in commonly available subroutine libraries, such as NAG,4 LINPACK,5 and ODEPACK,6 to perform all of the real numerical work. This is the approach used by the majority of research physicists. 

Third, we could write our own programs--completely from scratch--in a high-level language. This is the approach used in this course. I have opted not to use pre-written subroutine libraries, simply because I want students to develop the ability to think for themselves about scientific programming and numerical techniques. Students should, however, realize that, in many cases, pre-written library routines offer solutions to numerical problems which are pretty hard to improve upon. 

== Choice of Scientific Programming Languages ==
What is the best high-level language to use for scientific programming? This, unfortunately, is a highly contentious question. Over the years, literally hundreds of high-level languages have been developed. However, few have stood the test of time. Many languages (e.g., Algol, Pascal, Haskell) can be dismissed as ephemeral computer science fads. Others (e.g., Cobol, Lisp, Ada) are too specialized to adapt for scientific use. Let us examine the remaining options: 

===FORTRAN 77===
FORTRAN was the first high-level programming language to be developed: in fact, it predates the languages listed below by decades. Before the advent of FORTRAN. Moreover, FORTRAN was specifically designed for scientific computing. Indeed, in the early days of computers all computing was scientific in nature--i.e., physicists and mathematicians were the original computer scientists! FORTRAN's main advantages are that it is very straightforward, and it interfaces well with most commonly available, pre-written subroutine libraries (since these libraries generally consist of compiled FORTRAN code). FORTRAN's main disadvantages are all associated with its relative antiquity. For instance. FORTRAN's control statements are fairly rudimentary, whereas its input/output facilities are positively paleolithic. 

===C===
This language was originally developed by computer scientists to write operating systems. Indeed, all UNIX operating systems are written in C. C is, consequently, an extremely flexible and powerful language. Amongst its major advantages are its good control statements and excellent input/output facilities. C's main disadvantage is that, since it was not specifically written to be a scientific language, some important scientific features (e.g., complex arithmetic) are missing. Although C is a high-level language, it incorporates many comparatively low-level features, such as pointers (this is hardly surprisingly, since C was originally designed to write operating systems). The low-level features of C--in particular, the rather primitive implementation of arrays--sometimes make scientific programming more complicated than need be the case, and undoubtedly facilitate programming errors. On the other hand, these features allow scientific programmers to write extremely efficient code. Since efficiency is generally the most important concern in scientific computing, the low-level features of C are, on balance, advantageous. 

===C++===
This language is a major extension of C whose main aim is to facilitate object-orientated programming. Object-orientation is a completely different approach to programming than the more traditional procedural approach: it is particularly well suited to large projects involving many people who are each writing different segments of the same code. However, object-orientation represents a large, and somewhat unnecessary, overhead for the type of straightforward, single person programming tasks considered in this course. Note, however, that C++ incorporates some non-object-orientated extensions to C which are extremely useful. 
Of the above languages, we can immediately rule out C++, because object-orientation is an unnecessary complication (at least, for our purposes), and FORTRAN 90, because of the absence of an inexpensive compiler. The remaining options are FORTRAN 77 and C. I have chosen to use C++ (because it not only can be object oriented it can also be procedural like C) in this course, simply because I find the complex features of FORTRAN 77 too  embarrassing to teach students in the 21st century.

I don't know how to start a new bookshelf or I would do this. Religion does NOT belong under humanities. It needs a bookself of it own [[User:DKleinecke|DKleinecke]] 20:31, 7 April 2007 (UTC)



I don't know who created this page, but the social SCIENCES are not humanities.  There's no reason to start a flame war or anything based on this comment, but it is worth noting that they simply don't belong in the same category.  Call them 'soft' sciences or what have you, but they don't belong in the humanities.

== Unusual Religions ==

I think the headline Unusual Religions is a bit dergatory. I don't have any suggestions but I think it's better to be changed.

==Magick==

Belief in Magick is a religion, to whoever removed the article I requested. Look it up on Google...

== Status of Completion ==

Why isn't this indicated in all the cases ? and why can't i edit the document in order to let it do that ? very strange.--[[User:90.128.100.242|90.128.100.242]] 20:34, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Spreadsheet Program ==

This book will describe how specifically to use Microsoft Excel, as this is a widely used program. If you have access to this and are farmiliar with it is suggested that you use it. If you have another preferred spreadsheet program please feel free to use that, however be aware that you will have to refer to the help section where your spreadsheet program differs from this book.

If you would like a free spreadsheet program that works with nearly any operating system then 'Calc' from [http://www.openoffice.org OpenOffice.org] is highly recommended. Hopefully in the future this book will describe how to use this as well as Microsoft Excel.

Why use a spreadsheet? This chapter aims to show you that you can do things quickly and simply without having to learn and type execessive amounts code. We will see towards the end that using a spreadsheet has its limitations, but hopefully also the power of spreadsheets other than for just plotting graphs of your experimental results!

== Examples of Spreadsheet Program ==
=== Using Spreedsheets to calculate the Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations: ===

If x is a function of a real variable t and f is a function of both x and t, then the equation

              x’(t) = f(x(t), t) 		(1.1)

is called a first order differential equation. Solving such an equation involves more than algebraic manipulation; indeed, although the equation itself involves three quantities, x, f, and t, to find a solution we must identify a function x, defined solely in terms of the independent variable t, which satisfies the relationship of (1.1) for all t in some open interval. For many equations, exact solution is not possible and we have to rely on approximations. We will discuss one technique for finding both approximate and, where possible, exact solutions to differential equations. We have already seen many examples of differential equations we discussed finding the position of an object moving in a straight line given its velocity function and its initial position, when we discussed the motion of a projectile, when we considered the two-body problem. Indeed, in many ways the study of differential equations is at the heart of calculus. To study the interaction of physical bodies in the world is to study the ramifications of physical laws such as the law of gravitation and Newton’s second law of motion, laws which frequently lead questions involving the solution of differential equations. Newton was the first to realize the power of calculus for solving a vast array of physical problems. The mathematicians that followed him enlarged and refined his techniques until they began to believe that the entire future of the universe, as well as its past, could be discerned from the knowledge of the current positions and velocities of all physical bodies and the forces at work between them.
Today we know more about the limits to our knowledge, but, nevertheless, the study of differential equations remains a key component to our understanding of the universe.
To begin our study, consider the equation

                    x’(t) = f(x(t), t)		(1.2)

with the initial condition x(t0) = x0. To simplify notation, we will frequently omit the independent variable when referring to x(t) and write simply

                       x’ = f(x, t)		 (1.3)

Now if f(x, t) depends only on the value of t, that is, if f(x, t) = g(t) for all values of x, where g is a function of t alone, then we may solve (1.3) by integration. That is, integrating both sides (1.3) gives us	           		      

             x(t)  - x(t0) =   integral of [g(t), over [t,to]]	(1.4)
							 

which gives


             x(t) = x(t0) + integral of [g(t), over [t,to]]	(1.5)
						         
Assuming we can compute the definite integral, which can at least always be done numerically, we have solved the differential equation.

For Example

Consider the equation
           x’ = 4 sin(3t)

with initial condition x(0) = 5. Then

               x(t) = 5 - 4/3 cos3t + 4/3 = 1/3 (19 - 4 cos(3t)).

Knowing the value of t we can calculate the exact value of x at t.

Indeed, knowing the difficulty of evaluating ordinary definite integrals, it is not hard to believe that many, if not most; differential equations may be solved only through numerical approximation.
Although the function x in equation (1.3) is unknown, we do have enough information to find its best affine approximation at t0. Namely, the best affine approximation to x at t0 is obtained by the Taylor theorem using subinterval [t0,t1] of an entire interval [t0,t].

     x(t1) = x0 + f(x0, t0)(t - t0) + 0((t - t0)2 +...). where t1 = t0+h 	(1.6)
Equivalently,

                   x(t0 + h) = x0 + hf(x0, t0)		(1.7)

Thus for a small value of h,

                      x1 = x0 + hf(x0, t0)			(1.8)

Where 		
                      h = [[t1 – t0]]/n
		[in the above case n = 1]

Will provide a good approximation to x(t0 + h). However, we want to do more than this; since x is a function, we want to be able to approximate its values over an entire interval, say [t0, t]. To do so, we choose a small value for h and iterate the process that gave us x1. Specifically, we let t = t0 + nh, n = 0, 1, 2. 3,…, where n is chosen large enough and the generalized form of the Euler method is 

                 xn+1 = xn + hf(xn, tn) 			(1.9)

That is, we compute an approximation for x(tn+1) by applying the best affine approximation to our approximation for x(tn), repeating the process enough times until we have approximated x over the entire interval [t0, t]. This method of approximation is known as Euler’s method.

====Euler’s method====

To approximate a solution to the equation

                            x’ = f(x, t)

with initial condition x(t0) = x0 on an interval [t0, t], choose a small value for h &gt; 0 and an integer n such that t0 + nh  = t. Letting t = t0 + nh, compute x1, x2, . . . , xn+1 using the difference equation xn+1 = xn + hf(xn, tn). (1.10). Then xn+1 is an approximation for x(t0 + nh).

Consider the differential equation x’ = 0.04x with initial condition x(0) = 50. We know that the solution to this equation is

                        x(t) = 50e 0.04t .

In particular, x(50) = 50e 2 = 369.45, rounding our answer to the second decimal place. To approximate x on the interval [0, 50] using Euler’s method, we will first take h = 1 and, starting with x0 = 50, compute x1, x2. . . x50, where in this case xn+1 = xt will approximate x(t). Using (1.9) with f(x, t) = 0.04x and rounding to two decimal places, we have

n = 1:x1 = x0 + h(0.04x0) = 50 + (1)(0.04)(50) = 50 + 2 + 52.00

n = 2:x2 = x1 + h(0.04x1) = 52 + (1)(0.04)(52) = 52 + 2.08 = 54.08

n = 3: 	x3 = x2 + h(0.04x2) = 54.08 + (1)(0.04)(54.08) = 54.08 + 2.16 = 56.24


and so on, ending with x50 = 355.33.

Notice that the error in our approximation, that is, the difference between xn and x(n), increases as n increases. For example,

x(5) - x5 = 0.24,
whereas

x(50) - x50 = 14.12.

This should be expected since the error of the approximation on each step is compounded by the errors made in each of the preceding steps. The only way we can control the amount of error in our approximations is to decrease the step size. For example, if we reduce the step size to h = 0.1, we obtain

x1 = x0 + h(0.04x0) = 50 + (0.1)(0.04)(50) = 50 + 0.2 = 50.2000,
x2 = x1 + h(0.04x1) = 50.2 + (0.1)(0.04)(50.2) = 50.4008,
x3 = x2 + h(0.04x2) = 50.4008 + (0.1)(0.04)(50.4008) = 50.6024,
	………………………………………………………………….
	………………………………………………………………..
and ending with

	x500 = 367.98 (This can be easily calculated using computers)

We have to calculate the value of x500 and take it equivalent to x50 because from the definition of the parameter h

			h = (t – t0)/n

putting h=0.1 clearly the value of n, which actually is the number of iterations to be made, becomes 500 for t0 = 0 and t = 50.

=== Using Spreedsheets to calculate the Numerical Solutions of Integrals: ===

In calculus we come across very complicated and difficult integrals. They are difficult to solve using analytical methods for finding their numerical solutions. This problem can be solved by using numerical integrations e.g. Rectangular rule, limit of Sum definition, Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule.

==== The Trapezoidal Rule ==== 
Consider y = f[x] bounded by x=a to x=b. Than by definition integration of the function of x i.e. y w.r.t x is the area under the curve AB shown in figure

          Area =  F[x] = integral [f(x), over[a,b]dx 

now dividing the trapezoid into a Rectangle and an approximate triangle i.e. number of rectangles n = 1 we can write
 
		F[x] = h f[a] + ½ h {f[b] – f [a]}

		     = h {f[a] +1/2f[b] – 1/2f[a]}

		     = h/2 {f[a] + f[b]} = h/2 {f[x0] + f[x1]}

for n = 2 we have two rectangles and two triangle such that the approximate area under the curve now become

         F[x] = h/2 {f[a] +f[{a+b}/2]}+ h/2 {f[{a+b}/2] + f[b]}

		      = h/2 {f[a] + 2f[{a+b}/2] + f[b]}

		      = h/2 {f[x0] + 2f[x1] + f[x2]}

So generalizing for n divisions of the trapezoid we have

 F[x] = h/2 {f[x0] + 2f[x1] + 2f[x2] + … + 2f[xn-2] + 2f[xn-a] + f[xn]}

Is an approximation of the integral of y = f[x].

Where 
			h = b – a/n

n can be even or odd. And approximation can be improved using large value of n.

== The Random Walk ==

[[Image:Random_Walk_example.png|frame|right|An example of a one-dimensional random walk with 100 steps. The y-xis runs from 25 steps South (-25) to (25) steps North (25)]]

This is a book for physicists, so let's get right in and describe the physics we want to investigate. The random walk is a problem that occurs in various physics areas such as [[w:Brownian motion|Brownian motion]], which describes how molecules move about in a fluid (a fluid can either be a liquid or a gas). It also plays a role in [[w:quantum field theory|quantum field theory]], but this is much more complicated. Outside of physics the random walk can be applied to [[w:share prices|share prices]]. It is interesting that by investigating one problem we find solutions to entirely different ones, that have no other relationship to each other. This is something that occurs throughout physics, such as the way in which waves can be used to model [[w:traffic|traffic]] flows.

So what is a random walk? Imagine a drunk guy (yourself after a good night out if you like) who has just left their local bar. He is standing outside the bar and, being rather drunk, he randomly takes one step North up the street or one step South down the street. The probability of him going North or South is equal and all his steps are of the same length. If he does this for 100 steps how far on average has he got away from the bar? You may think on average he ends up very close to the bar, but actually this is not so! (Remember, distance means how many meters is he from the bar, and doesn't take account of where he is. If we found his average position treating North as positive, and South as negative, then by the symmetry of the situation we know that he would indeed end up outside the bar on average.)

We will investigate this problem and find how far he actually ends up away. This is a known as a one-dimensional random walk, as the drunkard walks only North or South. The same ideas can be applied in two dimensions, say a drunk in a field who staggers North, South, East or West. Three dimensions can similarly be investigated, and even four or more, although this is a bit of an abstract idea!

Can you see now how this links to Brownian motion (where molecules move randomly) or to share prices which have approximately equal chances of rising or falling?
[John]

== Making a one dimensional random walk ==

On a blank worksheet in your spreadsheet double click on cell '''B4''' and type '''=RAND()''' and press enter. In cell '''B4''' you should now see a decimal number between 0 and 1. Try hitting the '''F9''' key a few times, which recalculates the entire spreadsheet. You should see numbers being randomly generated in cell '''B4'''. By the way cell '''B4''' is specified so there can be some consistencey when referring you to specific cells. It will also allow the spreadsheet to be neatly formated later if you're so inclined! On the subject of formatting the whole random number may not be showing currently, if you click on cell '''B4''' so that it is highlighted and then go to the format menu, select column and then autofit selection the entire contents of the cell is shown. This can be done for the entire selecting the whole sheet, you can do this by clcking the grey box at the top left of the sheet, 

So, why did we type what we typed? You may well know if you're familiar with spreadsheets, = specifies that we're typing a mathematical function and not just text. RAND() is a function that the spreadsheet recognises as a request to generate a random number. If this isn't clear right now it will beome clear as we work through the rest of the chapter.

How do we transform this into a random walk? We need to transform this random number into an event with a 50:50 probability. What we need to do is generate a step South if the number is less than 0.5 and a step North if the number is more than 0.5. This is where we see how a simple spreadsheet can be transformed into a program.

Double click on cell '''C4''' and type: '''=IF(B4&lt;0.5,-1,1)'''. This was a bit more of a complicated function than the previous! What the '''IF''' function does is to set the value of a cell to one value if the condition specified is true, or another value if the condition is false. The structure of this function goes like this: '''IF(Condition , Value if True, Value if False)'''. '''B4&lt;0.5''' is the condition, this means 'if cell '''B4''' is less than 0.5'.

You should now be able to work out what values of the random number will make it take a step South (generating a -1) or a step North (generating a 1). If not try it and find out! It should work the same way as it was said it would a bit earlier.

Taking one step isn't particularly exciting or impressive (or if you think it is you're going to absolutely love the rest of the book!) so we'll see how we can expand it to 100 steps. It's fairly easy actually, simply click on cell '''B4''' so it is selected and the move the mouse over the little square in the bottom right corner. The mouse cursor will change and you can then drag down to fill the cells below with the same formulae as in this cell. Drag down to cell '''B103''' so that we will be taking 100 steps. It is even easier to fill the cells in column '''C''', all you need do now is double click on the little black square in the bottom corner of cell '''C4''', this will fill it down to the same row as column '''B''' is filled down to. Notice that in cell '''C4''' we have a function that relies on the value of the function in '''B4'''. But when we fill the other cells they automatically change so that the function depends on the value of the cell in the left. This is usually very handy, but we'll see in a bit that sometimes we need to override it.

Now we can hit '''F9''' and each time generate a random walk! But it's still not very interesting to look at, or a very informative, we can't see where the drunkard is unless we add up all the cells at the moment, nor can we see where he is it any particular position. This can be easily corrected, enter into '''D4''' the function '''SUM(C$4:C4)'''. Hopefully you can guess what this does, it adds up (sums) all the cells between '''C4''' and, well, um '''C4'''. Not too useful as it is you might think, and why is that $ sign there? Well, if you fill down into the cells below you'll see that each cell adds up the total of all the steps taken, and gives the current position of the drunkard after this step. If you look at cell '''D20''' you should get an idea of what's happening, this cell sums between '''C4''' and '''C20'''. The $ sign acts to fix a value when you fill cells below.

Now you can use the spreadsheet to make a graph of the random walk, if you don't know how to do this check the help section of your spreadsheet. As a couple of hints to make the graph look good put a '0' in cell '''D3''' so that the drunkard can start outside the bar and select a line graph. Press '''F9''' to generate new graphs.

Do the graphs you've created look like what you would expect, do they actually look ''random''? You'll probably see some strange patterns in some graphs, but they are honestly random! This will hopefully make you think about what a random pattern truly looks like.

&lt;big&gt;A tie or necktie is a garment, conventionally worn around a man's neck with a collared shirt.  There are several ways that the knot can be tied.  A common, easy knot is the Four-In-Hand.  However this is not the simplest knot.&lt;/big&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Whyte. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Whyte~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Scholastic Interests'''

I'm currently studying Criminal Justice topics. My concentration is on understanding and mitigating social conflict. I also have a growing interest in international affairs and global social justice issues. 

My focus has largely been understanding social phenomenon at an experiential level. Said another way, I am interested in understanding how one's relative level of knowledge about a phenomenon affects the way in which one relates to and with one's social and physical environment. Acedemicly this had involved the study of event level decision making, particular in instances of socially defined criminal behavior.

__TOC__

== Description ==

R&lt;b&gt;'Bit_Order&lt;/b&gt; is a [[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation attributes|representation attribute]] used to specify the [[w:bit numbering|bit numbering]] of a [[Ada Programming/Representation clauses|record representation clause]] (for a record type). The bit ordering is of type &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/package|System}}.Bit_Order&lt;/tt&gt;, and may be either:
* &lt;tt&gt;High_Order_First&lt;/tt&gt; when the bit 0 is the [[w:most significant bit|most significant bit]]
* &lt;tt&gt;Low_Order_First&lt;/tt&gt; when the bit 0 is the [[w:least significant bit|least significant bit]]
assuming the bit sequence is interpreted as an integer value. The constant &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/package|System}}.Default_Bit_Order&lt;/tt&gt; represents the native bit numbering of the platform.

It is worth noting that the bit ordering only affects the bit numbering for a record representation clause, and ''not the [[w:endianness|byte order]]'' of its (multibyte) fields.
&lt;ref&gt;Note that when the ARM talks about &quot;big endian&quot; and &quot;litte endian&quot; in the definition of the 'Bit_Order attribute it really means ''bit endianness'', not ''byte endianness''. (Nowadays the term ''endianness'' is usually reserved for talking about [[w:endianness|byte order]], although it can also be used for [[w:bit numbering|bit numbering]].) Thus, in this context, when the ARM says &quot;little endian&quot; it refers to &quot;[[w:LSB0|LSB 0]]&quot;, and when it says &quot;big endian&quot; this is the same as &quot;[[w:MSB0|MSB 0]]&quot;: &lt;blockquote&gt;«''&lt;tt&gt;High_Order_First&lt;/tt&gt; (known in the vernacular as “big endian”) means that the first bit of a storage element (bit 0) is the most significant bit (interpreting the sequence of bits that represent a component as an unsigned integer value). &lt;tt&gt;Low_Order_First&lt;/tt&gt; (known in the vernacular as “little endian”) means the opposite: the first bit is the least significant.''» {{Ada/Ref RM|13|5|3|par=2|id=I4589}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

Storage units are ordered by their addresses. Let's look at an integer occupying several bytes (let's assume a byte being 8 bits for this discussion).

* On a big endian (BE) machine, the integer's most significant byte is stored at the least address.
* On a little endian (LE) machine, its least significant byte is stored at the least address.

So in order to be able to count bits consecutively across byte boundaries, Ada counts bits within a byte according to the endianness from most significant bit (MSB) 0 to least significant bit (LSB) on BE and the other way round on LE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ada/83/Cite RM|13|4|
 |      title = Record Representation Clauses
 |      quote = The range defines the bit positions of the storage place, relative to the storage unit. The first storage unit of a record is numbered zero. The first bit of a storage unit is numbered zero. The ordering of bits in a storage unit is machine_dependent and may extend to adjacent storage units.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is how it looks (conveniently writing left to right on BE, right to left on LE):

 BE Byte    0 1 2 …  (counting bytes, i.e. addresses, left to right; higher addresses to the right)
 LE Byte  … 2 1 0    (counting bytes right to left; higher addresses to the left)
 
          MSB         LSB
 BE  Bit  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  (counting bits within a byte left to right)
 LE  Bit  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  (counting bits right to left)

We're used to writing left to right, but for LE, as you can see, it's convenient to write addresses from right to left. So on BE, a sequence of bytes and bits is counted like this:

 Byte 0               1               2
 Bit  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 &lt;b&gt;3 4 5 6 7&lt;/b&gt; 8 9 0 1 …
                      0 1 2 3 4 &lt;b&gt;5 6 7 8 9&lt;/b&gt; 0 1 2 3 …  (we can equally begin to count at byte 1)

In order to be able to write and count consecutively on LE, we have to write right to left like the Arabs (the MSB is always on the left):

 Byte             2               1               0
 Bit  … 1 0 9 8 &lt;b&gt;7 6 5 4 3&lt;/b&gt; 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
      … 3 2 1 0 &lt;b&gt;9 8 7 6 5&lt;/b&gt; 4 3 2 1 0

In a record representation like the following (of course only one of the two lines specifying X may be present)

 for T use record
   X at 0 range 13 .. 17;  -- these to lines…
   X at 1 range  5 ..  9;  -- … are equivalent
 end record;

the component X occupies the bits shown in boldface. The byte number (0 resp. is 1) is called Position, the bounds are called First_Bit (13 resp. 5) and Last_Bit (17 resp. 9); there are corresponding attributes [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Position|'Position]], [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'First_Bit|'First_Bit]] and [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Last_Bit|'Last_Bit]]. (The meaning of the component X is irrelevant here, only its size is relevant.) As you can see, X is a crossborder component. Thus the result of applying the attribute 'Bit_Order to a record with crossborder components depends on the Ada generation.

== Ada 95 ==

Ada 95 defines the result of the attribute for the non-native bit order only when applied within a storage unit or when an item completely fills a sequence of storage units. By applying the attribute to a record, we force the compiler to count bits in the indicated manner, independent of the machine architecture.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Rec {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 5;
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 6 .. 7;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Rec'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} High_Order_First;

The component B occupies the bits shown in boldface:

 Byte 0
 Bit  0 1 2 3 4 5 &lt;b&gt;6 7&lt;/b&gt;

The layout of this record will be the same on BE and on LE machines, i.e. the representation is endian-independent.

We could equally well have defined this record like so and arrived at the same endian-independent layout:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Rec {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 2 .. 7;
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 1;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Rec'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} Low_Order_First;

 Byte               0
 Bit  7 6 5 4 3 2 &lt;b&gt;1 0&lt;/b&gt;

However a record like the following, where B is crossborder, is only valid on a BE machine, i.e. in the native bit order.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Rec {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 5;
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 6 .. 9;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Rec'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} High_Order_First;

 Byte 0               1               2
 Bit  0 1 2 3 4 5 &lt;b&gt;6 7 8 9&lt;/b&gt; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 …

Compiled on a LE machine, the compiler will complain that B occupies non-contiguous storage and reject the code, since the byte order is not affected by the attribute (remember, the next byte with bit numbers 8 to 15 has to be put on the left):

 Byte   2               1               0
 Bit    … &lt;b&gt;8 9&lt;/b&gt; 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 &lt;b&gt;6 7&lt;/b&gt;

As an example of a record where items fill a range of complete storage units take:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Rec {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 ..  7;
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 1 {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 15;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Rec'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} High_Order_First;

This is valid on both architectures leading to the layout:

 BE   0               1               2
 Bit  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &lt;b&gt;0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5&lt;/b&gt;

 LE                 2               1               0

where A fills the bits in normal face, B those in bold face. As you can see, it doesn't matter that bits are counted in this strange way on LE since component B fills its two bytes completely.

== Ada 2005 ==

For the native bit order, there is no change. Record representation specifiations have worked since Ada 83. Only the attribute 'Bit_Order has been introduced in Ada 95 with the restrictions as shown above.

In order to improve the situation for non-native bit orders, Ada 2005 introduces the notion of ''machine scalars''. A machine scalar is a conceptual hardware based unsigned integer within which bits are counted and the components positioned as requested.

We need a more elaborated record example now (the values returned by the corresponding attributes 'Position, 'First_ and 'Last_Bit (in native bit order) are given as comments; note that the bit numbers returned are always counted starting with the byte in which the component begins):
 
 {{Ada/kw|for}} T {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   I {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 15;  -- at 0 range 0 .. 15
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 12;  -- at 2 range 0 .. 12
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 13 .. 17;  -- at 3 range 5 ..  9
   C {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 18 .. 23;  -- at 4 range 2 ..  7
   D {{Ada/kw|at}} 5 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 ..  7;  -- at 5 range 0 ..  7
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

Let's assume I is a 16 bit (signed or unsigned) integer, the other components are of some unspecified types with the given size requirements. The complete record's size is 48. This is how it looks like on BE and LE machines:

 Byte 0       1       2       3       4       5
   BE 012345678901234501234567890123456789012301234567
      IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDD
 
      DDDDDDDDCCCCCCBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
   LE 765432103210987654321098765432105432109876543210
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

In the following, we're going to show how far we can go to reach endian-independence of the representation. The result will be that we only have to swap bytes after transfer from one architecture to the other when the new Ada 2005 features are used correctly.

For the following, we'll assume that we are on a big-endian machine, so that we append the corresponding attribute to the representation:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} T {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   I {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 15;
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 12;
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 13 .. 17;
   C {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 18 .. 23;
   D {{Ada/kw|at}} 5 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 ..  7;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} T'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} High_Order_First;

When this is compiled on a little-endian machine, all components with the same Position are taken together and put in a matching machine scalar. The machine scalar is positioned at the given Position, but inside the bits are counted from the opposite side.

Let's take the first component, I. It uses 16 bits, so a 16 bit machine scalar will do. It is positioned at byte 0, but inside the compiler will count from the high order bit side. This is how it looks (NNBO - non-native bit order):

                                      IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 NNBO                                 0123456789012345
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

Now to the next Position 2. The respective components A, B, C use together three bytes, so a 32 bit machine scalar is needed. It is positioned at byte 2, and inside the count will again start from the opposite side. This is how it looks:

                                      IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 NNBO &lt;b&gt;01234567890123456789012345678901&lt;/b&gt;0123456789012345
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

The bit count starts at the high order bit of byte 5 and continues down to the low order bit of byte 2.
The components A, B, C are positioned inside this scalar according to the respective ranges. Thus we arrive at this layout:

      AAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCC        IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 NNBO &lt;b&gt;01234567890123456789012345678901&lt;/b&gt;0123456789012345
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

We immediately see the conflict with component D, whose range is already occupied by A, and the compiler will of course complain and reject the code. The solution is simple: Just instead of locating D at Position 5, we change this to the (on BE) equivalent line like so:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} T {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   I {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 15;
   A {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 12;
   B {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 13 .. 17;
   C {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 18 .. 23;
 --D at 5 range  0 ..  7;
   D {{Ada/kw|at}} 2 {{Ada/kw|range}} 24 .. 31;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} T'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} High_Order_First;

And, drum roll, on LE, we now have (for comparison, the native layout is also given):

      AAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 NNBO &lt;b&gt;01234567890123456789012345678901&lt;/b&gt;0123456789012345
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0
 
      IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDD
   BE 0123456789012345&lt;b&gt;01234567890123456789012345678901&lt;/b&gt;
 Byte 0       1       2       3       4       5

In the non-native bit order, the values returned by the corresponding attributes 'Position, 'First_ and 'Last_Bit are exactly those given in the record specification.

As an additional service, GNAT's compilation output will give you the values as counted in the native bit order within the machine scalar:

        range
 &quot;I&quot;   0 .. 15
 &quot;A&quot;  19 .. 31
 &quot;B&quot;  14 .. 18
 &quot;C&quot;   8 .. 13
 &quot;D&quot;   0 ..  7
 
      AAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 NNBO &lt;b&gt;01234567890123456789012345678901&lt;/b&gt;0123456789012345
   LE 109876543210987654321098765432105432109876543210
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

This is as far as we can get with the current Ada standard.

== Data Transfer ==

Let us transfer a value of this record from the native big-endian machine to a little-endian machine. For demonstration purposes, the high-oder parts of the crossborder items are shown in upper case, the low-order parts in lower case.

      IIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiAAAAAAAAaaaaaBBBbbCCCCCCDDDDDDDD
   BE 012345678901234501234567890123456789012345678901
 Byte 0       1       2       3       4       5

The bytes will be transferred in the given order. Since the bit order attribute does not reorder the bytes after transfer, on the target machine we will receive the data in scrambled order:

      DDDDDDDDbbCCCCCCaaaaaBBBAAAAAAAAiiiiiiiiIIIIIIII
 NNBO 012345678901234567890123456789010123456789012345
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

All we have to do to arrive at the desired end, is to swap bytes 0↔1, 2↔5, 3↔4:

      AAAAAAAAaaaaaBBBbbCCCCCCDDDDDDDDIIIIIIIIiiiiiiii
 NNBO 012345678901234567890123456789010123456789012345
 Byte        5       4       3       2       1       0

== Example ==

The following two sets of representation clauses specify the same register layout in any machine / compiler (Ada 2005 and later):

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Device_Register {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        Ready : Status_Flag;
        Error : Error_Flag;
        Data  : Unsigned_16;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  Device_Register {{Ada/kw|use}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        Ready {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 0;
        Error {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}}  1 .. 1;
        {{Ada/--|Reserved bits}}
        Data  {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 16 .. 31;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Register'Size      {{Ada/kw|use}} 32;
 '''{{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Register'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} System.Low_Order_First;'''
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Atomic}} (Device_Register);

If the bit order is modified, the bit numbering of all the elements of the record representation clause must be reversed:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Device_Register {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        Ready : Status_Flag;
        Error : Error_Flag;
        Data  : Unsigned_16;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  Device_Register {{Ada/kw|use}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        Ready {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 31 .. 31;   {{Ada/--|Bit numbering has changed}}
        Error {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}} 30 .. 30;   {{Ada/--|Bit numbering has changed}}
        {{Ada/--|Reserved bits}}
        Data  {{Ada/kw|at}} 0 {{Ada/kw|range}}  0 .. 15;   {{Ada/--|Bit numbering has changed (but byte order is not affected)}}
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Register'Size      {{Ada/kw|use}} 32;
 '''{{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Register'Bit_Order {{Ada/kw|use}} System.High_Order_First;''' {{Ada/--|Reverse bit order}}
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Atomic}} (Device_Register);

Both can be interchangeably used in the same machine. But note that in two machines with different endianness the &lt;tt&gt;Data&lt;/tt&gt; field will have the native ''byte order'' regardless of the ''bit order'' specified in the representation clauses.

== Incorrect Usage ==

{{:Ada Programming/Attributes/'Bit_Order:3}}

== Interfacing ==

Record representation clauses are a unique feature of the Ada language as far as the authors know, so there is no need to have a feature similar to attribute 'Bit_Order in other programming languages. It is common practice in other programming languages to use masks and bit operations explicitly, thus the native bit numbering must always be used.

Basically if you have any advice, changes, tips or anything else just leave a message.

Also, this is where I'll keep credits for now for all the contributors.

UPDATE: T-Marsh is currently working on the illustrations. Since we all have a life outside of Wiki, this is a SLOW process but we'll post them as soon as they become available.

== Comments Section ==

Yea, i came to this page to learn how to tie a tie, but was just told what different kinds of knots there are.  Could you maybe include a step by step procedure for actually making all of the different knots?  That would be a GREAT help! 

::''Working on it buddy-- I'm working on the line drawings and illustrations. If anyone wants to collaborate and help that would be much appreciated. --[[User:Shmeedogg|Shmeedogg]] 20:57, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)''


There are drawings of &quot;how to&quot; tie knots in the wikimedia commons and on wikipedia. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bowtie Bowtie] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Double_windsor.png Double windsor]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:32, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::''Thanks for the tip Kellen. The problem, though, is that those drawings are craptastic! No offense, but we need some quality illustrations to help tie-newbies.'' 


Shmeedogg: Begging your pardon if this is not the right protocol/format but I'm a newbie to the wiki thing.  However, I am an experienced professional at technical illustrating.  If you can send me some kind of pencil sketch that outlines how the ends of the tie are positioned/move maybe I can help.  All else failing, I can cheat with screen shots from from the following website if you are willing to suggest changes that will improve things: www.tieanecktie.com. FROM:tmmarshall2@comcast.net (please put your screenname/WIKI in the subject heading so that I accept your e-mail).

btw, if you use a colon (&quot;:&quot;) for each level of indentation in comments, it'll make things more readable. e.g:

== The Pratt is not a poor cousin... ==

I prefer the Pratt because it is symmetrical without the bulk of the Windsor. I think it is more elegant and streamlined. Some ties with thicker linings are almost untieable with the Windsor, but look quite good with a Pratt. Many of my friends wonder why I have to untie my tie after I take it off, I explain, and most of them have adopted it themselves. Please give the Pratt its due. It was only discovered in the 1980's, so it is not mainstream, but it certainly is not analogous with a VW. Try it before you dismiss it as &quot;commie&quot; garb. The Four-in-Hand would be at the bottom of my list just behind the Half-Windsor.

== Four-In-Hand (feedback) +Oriental ==

I have just put a step by step guide up from tying my own tie several times.  I have checked it from starting either way round and find the narrow to my (biological/medical) right to be easiest starting position, but this is because I always tie it that way.  They both give the same knot.  

I am unsure if it is affected by handedness, I am right handed.  

If '''anyone who doesn't know how to tie a tie''' would like to post a message if they cannot follow the instructions let me know so I can improve the instructions.  Please let me know where it all started to go wrong if you have an idea.  If you know exactly where the instructions make you tie it wrong, change them if you wish.  This is to make the instrucitions better so ''please do not send me messages of panic'', as I am unable to be able to answer them fast enough and will feel bad at not being able to help you in time.

== Reorg suggestion ==

I'd suggest that, rather than having &quot;The Knots&quot; and &quot;How to tie them&quot;, that these instead be divided into pages on a per-knot basis, ie. one page for &quot;Windsor&quot;, one for &quot;Pratt&quot;, and the like</text>

Continued from discussion with Tilly as [[User:61.9.214.113|61.9.214.113]]:
I'm sorry if you felt that I was editing your work unfairly. But, because you were contributing anonymously, I had no way of knowing what your intentions were (also, you didn't fill out your edit summaries, as you should). I'm also concerned that you have replaced the current process with your own proprietary process, that can be seen as advertising, and is not allowed on Wikibooks. I see that you have toned down your claims for remuneration, that's good. But, you do understand that you lose any clam to the process once you have submitted it to Wikibooks (as you have licensed it under the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GFDL] by the act of submitting it)? It will be modified without mercy. Additionally, you don't need to sign your work unless it's on a talk page.

Hello Geocachernemesis,
I just did not understand how my edits were changing back so fast.

I am struggling with the operations of this forum, computers are not my strong point.
I did not see any edit summeries to fill out or anything else and I do not even know how to reply to you here properly, but I hope this reaches you.
I finally found the registration feature and am now logged in.
Believe it or not I got to this page by accident when I was &quot;Googling&quot; something else altogether different and I have not got a clue exactly &quot;Where I am&quot; now.
I could never re-locate the page where I wrote to you the first time.

The Work I was editing is an early version of a Biodiesel production procedure which I developed. 
It is probably the single most popular method of making mini-batches of biodiesel in the English speaking Biodiesel World and is known throughout the biodiesel world as the &quot;World Famous Dr Pepper Technique (Pat Pend)&quot; 
I did not post it to this forum just like I have not posted it to many other forums across the internet where it appears.
It makes me feel good to see that something I have developed is spreading all over the internet helping people.

Because this forum is editable I was updating the posting to include the latest changes to the procedure. 
The (Pat Pend) and reminder of royalties due after 53,459 litres production payable through your &quot;Favourite Swiss Bank account&quot; are probably tongue in cheek, but if some one wants to send me money... 
While I am flattered that people think so highly of my work that it has been posted here without asking my permission, I do think that as it is my work it should have my &quot;Name&quot; on it.

Tilly

I'm sorry if my reaction seemed harsh. It's nothing personal, but I'm simply trying to uphold Wikibooks policy. Unfortunately, your biodiesel recipe is original research and will probably not be allowed by Wikibooks, see [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not|What Wikibooks is not]].

If you would like to learn more about Wikibooks, then here are some tips to help you get started:

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* Check out our [[Wikibooks:Help|help]] page if you need additional help.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Good luck!

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tilly. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tilly~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

__NOTOC__
'''Fried chicken''' is a Southern main meal in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], served often at &quot;Sunday dinner&quot; (&quot;dinner&quot; being the midday meal for many Southerners) or church &quot;suppers&quot; (&quot;supper&quot; being the term for the evening meal). Recipes are legion; every family has one handed down. 

Here's one:

==To make the Chicken==

===Ingredients===
*one whole [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard powder]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne powder]]
*2 tsp cracked [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] seasoned with herbs and spices (see procedure)

The spice mix isn't fixed. You can use more or less as desired.

===Procedure===
# Cut up a chicken into 8-10 pieces.
# Mix other ingredients except seasoned flour together, and [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] the chicken pieces for four hours in the mixture.
# Take each chicken piece out of the marinade and allow it to drip dry a few seconds. Then dredge it in seasoned flour. (Seasonings could include pepper, cayenne, salt, ground coriander, cinnamon, thyme, oregano). An easy way to dredge: put flour and seasonings in a small plastic bag, drop the piece in, and shake.
# Let the pieces rest (separately; do not stack) for about 10 minutes. Then dredge them again. The first dredging absorbs the buttermilk marinade. The second dredging gives a seasoned flour outer coat.
# Fry pieces in a deep, wide pan. Use an oil with a high smoke-point (peanut oil is good, but corn oil is okay too). When oil is smoking hot, drop pieces into the pan, and be careful to not overcrowd (pieces should not touch; fry in two batches). After three or four minutes, turn the chicken, and reduce the heat. Let the chicken fry for 20-25 minutes, turning the pieces every few minutes. When the chicken is a deep golden-brown, and the juices run clear, it's done. The chicken will continue to cook after being removed from the pan, so err on the side of &quot;just about done&quot;.
# Drain the chicken on absorbent paper or cloth. If you are not serving the chicken immediately, place it in a lightly-warmed oven, uncovered, separately (not stacked).

==To make the gravy==

===Ingredients===
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (or [[Cookbook:Green onion|shallots]]) chopped
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|clove of garlic]]
* 3-4 tbsp [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Stock|chicken stock/bouillon]] (or 2 cups stock and 1 cup [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]])
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

===Procedure===
# Pour off the accumulated oil from the pan, though reserving 3-4 tablespoons and all the flour and chicken residue. Keeping the pan on medium flame, toss in one small chopped onion and a clove of garlic. [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] for a few minutes. Whisk in 3-4 tablespoons of flour, and keep stirring until the mixture becomes light to medium brown. Do not burn.
# Whisk in 3 cups of chicken stock or bouillon (or 2 cups stock and 1 cup cream). Simmer on low flame, covered, for 15 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.
# Serve chicken with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and with some green vegetable. Spoon gravy over rice and chicken.

'''Fried okra''' means summer in the southern states of the USA. A quick mid-day meal; a side-dish at the evening meal -- easy to make and always tasty.

==Ingredients==
* Fresh [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]]
* Buttermilk or plain [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
* Corn meal
* Selected spices - [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], etc.

==Procedure==

# Wash and drain a couple of handfuls of fresh okra.
# Cut each okra into three or four slices, about 3/4 to one inch long (2-2.5 cm). Discard the stem.
# Soak the okra in buttermilk or plain milk, drain, then dredge in seasoned flour &amp; corn meal. A quick way to do this is to put a half cup of flour and a cup of corn meal in a plastic bag, add the spices you like (salt, pepper, cayenne, cumin, thyme, etc.), put in the okra and shake.
# Let the okra rest a few minutes. If any pieces look soggy, dredge them again in a flour/corn meal mix.
# Fry the okra in hot oil until a light to medium brown. They're done in 2-3 minutes.
# Drain, and enjoy!

'''Vinaigrette''' (from French ''vinaigre'', vinegar) is an emulsion of acid and fat, usually with other flavorings. It is one of the most basic salad dressings.

==Ingredients==
* 1 clove of garlic, smashed
* 2 tablespoons vinegar
* 1 teaspoon mustard
* 6 tablespoons oil (vegetable, extra virgin olive, almond, hazelnut, etc.)
* salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
* herbs to taste

==Procedure==
# Mix garlic, salt, mustard and vinegar until smooth.
# Add oil and mix until smooth.
# Add pepper and herbs to taste.
# Let stand; the longer the herbs and mustard soak in the oil, the better-blended the flavor will be.   You may need to quickly remix the vinaigrette just before dressing the salad if the oil and vinegar have separated while standing.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* The classical ratio of vinegar to oil is 1:3. Some recipes, however, suggest a ratio as low as 1:5.
* It is important to mix the mustard and vinegar first, then add the oil.  This helps the emulsion hold better, resulting in a smooth vinaigrette that is slow to separate out.   Adding the oil in a stream and mixing as it is added helps even more.
* Use a pleasantly flavored vinegar such as balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar.
* Mustard powder may be used instead of regular mustard.
* Instead of the garlic, a similar amount of very finely diced shallot may be used.
* Toss the dressing with the salad just before serving.  Greens that have been dressed wilt and become unappetizing within a few minutes.
* Different oils can be used for different flavors. Some suggest the use of vegetable oil, but this tends to add little in the way of flavor and most would find it unsuitable. Extra virgin olive oil is always a good choice, but nearly any plant oil can be used and experimentation is always good.

----

There are four people at one end of a bridge and they need to get across. The bridge is old and can only support two people at a time. It's night and  one of the two must carry a flashlight. The four people have only one flashlight. Also, they move at different speeds. A group moves only as fast as its slowest member. The crossing times of the four are 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes respectively. 

How can they make it to the other side of the bridge in 17 minutes?

----

Let's name the four people:
* A - the person who can cross the bridge in 1 minute
* B - the person who can get across in 2 minutes
* C - the person who needs 5 minutes to cross the bridge
* D - the slowest and needs 10 minutes to get across

Now, to make it to the other side in 17 minutes, they do the following

# A &amp; B cross first (total time: 2 minutes)
# A leaves B on the other side and returns with the flashlight (time: 1 minute; total time: 3 minutes)
# C &amp; D cross with the flashlight(time: 10 minutes; total time: 13 minutes)
# B returns with the flash light (time: 2 minutes; total time: 15 minutes)
# Finally, A &amp; B cross to the other side of the bridge (time: 2 minutes; total time: 17 minutes)
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Here's a funny poem written by Karen Lingel:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
FOUR HUNGRY MEN CROSS A BRIDGE &lt;nowiki&gt;by&lt;/nowiki&gt; Karen Lingel, Physicist and Penguinist
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
''Four men start out to cross the sea''&lt;br/&gt;
''And yet they all walk different speeds!''&lt;br/&gt;
''The first, a sprinter, he goes fast''&lt;br/&gt;
''He leaves the others in the past!''&lt;br/&gt;
''The second takes a bit more time''&lt;br/&gt;
''[Note to myself: think up a rhyme]''&lt;br/&gt;
''The third's a somewhat pokey man''&lt;br/&gt;
''He strolls along, sees what he can.''&lt;br/&gt;
''The last one is so very slow''&lt;br/&gt;
''You'd think he had no place to go!''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
''So now they come upon a bridge''&lt;br/&gt;
''And on the other side -- a fridge!''&lt;br/&gt;
''Well -- you know men -- they've gotta see''&lt;br/&gt;
''What's inside the fridge to eat!''&lt;br/&gt;
''One flashlight is the light they've got''&lt;br/&gt;
''To guide them to the eating spot.''&lt;br/&gt;
''The batteries will only last''&lt;br/&gt;
''Seventeen minutes -- that's a fact.''&lt;br/&gt;
''The bridge, alas, -- and here's the trap --''&lt;br/&gt;
''Is apparently a piece of crap.''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
''So only two men at a time''&lt;br/&gt;
''can cross the bridge -- or they'll sink in brine!''&lt;br/&gt;
''How can they all then make the trip?''&lt;br/&gt;
''And use the light so no one slips?''&lt;br/&gt;
''Send the fast guys first across''&lt;br/&gt;
''The fastest returns with little loss.''&lt;br/&gt;
''The pokey ones are next to go''&lt;br/&gt;
''While Fast Guy waits (they sure are slow)''&lt;br/&gt;
''Then send the other fast guy back''&lt;br/&gt;
''To get his friend and complete the pack.''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
''And this rounds out, for all to see''&lt;br/&gt;
''Another FAQ in poetry.''&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The solution offered is not correct. There is a bigger chance that you will see 2 sides then 3. I SUSPECT the actual chance decreases the further you move away, approaching 50%, but I haven't calculated this (I haven't calculated anything, because the maths on this are pretty complex).

Now I hear you guys/girls shouting: WHERE IS YOUR PROOF?
Well, very simple really: While I agree all the triangles have a 36° corner at their point, they do NOT share the same origin. Thus, a cross-section for a green triagle (3 side view) will be smaller then one from a yellow (2 side view) triangle at the same distance from the pentagon center.
The author actually admits this: ''&quot;When the distance from the Pentagon becomes large, the initial difference between the yellow and green sectors becomes negligible, and so the probability of being in a yellow sector (and seeing exactly two walls) is 50%&quot;''

The puzzle states that the distance should be larger then the 'only able to see 1 side' distance (it even says: ''&quot;You are standing near The Pentagon.&quot;'').
To make this puzzle work it should state something like: You are looking at the Pentagon from a great distance. What is the probability that you are only seeing 2 sides.

Also, the last line offering 'proof' is clearly wrong (''&quot;If you see two sides of building, you friend at opposite side sees three of them. For each spot where you can see two sides, there is one spot where you can see three sides, and for each spot where you can see three sides, there is one spot where you can see two sides. This gives us exacly 50%.&quot;'').
Explanation:
Alice takes position exactly left of the Pentagon (as seen in the diagram on the solution page), at a large distance (at least outside the 'red' part). She is in the yellow triangle.
Bob takes position exactly right of the Pentagon (as seen in the diagram on the solution page), at a large distance (at least outside the 'red' part). He is in the yellow triangle.
You can draw a straight line from Alice to Bob. Alice and Bob have found a spot where they both see 2 sides and are directly opposite each other.

*Oh, solution really is wrong. I just took it from some book, so i didn't really think if it correct or not. Then this thing is probably much more complex, and probably should be removed. --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 19:31, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

----
The solution is somewhat correct. The problem is you're looking at a fraction of an infinite plane.
If you start with a disk with as center the center of the pentagon, then indeed as the radius of the circle increases, the two fractions are the same (the seemingly extra bit of the yellow area is a zero-fraction of the plane, just like the pink areas). So the probability would be 50-50. 

However, you could also look at an ellipse, instead of a disk. With the pentagon in on of the foci, and the other focus either in a green or red area. Now if you increase the size of the ellipse (along the large axis) and take the limit to infinity, then the probability gets skewed tremendously towards whatever area the second focus is in.

And that's just two possible approaches to find 'the' probability. Infinity is not a concept to mess around with indiscriminitely.

For fun compare this to taking the sum over all integer numbers. You can go '''0 + 1 + -1 + 2 + -2 + 3 + -3 ...''' which has a cauchy limit of 0. But there is no reason why you couldn't do ''' 0 + 1 + 2 + -1 + 3 + 4 + -2 ...''' which goes to infinity in the limit. Despite that in both cases you add every single number from the set once.

-- [[User:129.125.102.149|towr]] 17:44, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Yes, the 50% probability is a limit of the probability as we choose random points in increasingly large circles centred at the Pentagon. If you have a better interpretation of &quot;the probability&quot;, please share it. 

--[[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] 19:15, Jun 30, 2005 (UTC)
: I'm not entirely convinced that is the only valid interpretation of 'the probability', although it certainly is the most natural, and probably the only one to give a sensible answer (but then not all good puzzles have answers, let alone sensible ones). If you want the probability for when you're at a given (be it unknown) distance, that I'd agree it's unambiguously 50%. But what the stochastic variable actually is in this case seems ambiguous to me. But maybe I'm just being daft :P  -- towr

::Actually, at any given fixed radius (larger than the red triangles) you have a probability of seeing two sides in excess of 50%, but this difference decreases as the circle's radius increases inversely to the radius. I too agree the puzzle is ambiguous. [[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] July 6, 2005 04:43 (UTC)

Also, another thing in defense of the proof: look at the diagram from a '''very''' large distance above it. All you will see will be a point with five yellow and five green triangles, which will all appear identical.

How can I refer to a picture from wikipedia?

I believe the answer is that you can't.  You would have to upload it to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/ Wikimedia Commons].  When this is done, you can include it as if it's in the same wiki.  As I've just done here. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:58, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)

Solving for three cannot be done. Solving for four is an easy job. All that takes is finding the midpoints of all the sides and connecting them to form 4 congruent triangles. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:68.255.27.230|68.255.27.230]] ([[User talk:68.255.27.230|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/68.255.27.230|contribs]]) 23:02, 10 February 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

'''Titan''' is the largest moon of the planet Saturn. It is also the second largest moon in the solar system.

==How big is Titan?==
The moon Titan is 5150 km wide.  It is the second largest moon in the Solar System.  Only Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter, is larger.  Titan is bigger than either the planet Mercury or dwarf planet Pluto.  It is nearly one and a half times the size of the Earth's Moon, and has nearly twice the mass of the Moon.  Titan is the only body besides Pluto, that we know of, that has a colder surface temperature because it has an atmosphere.  The surface temperature of Titan is -180 degrees centigrade.

==What is its surface like?==
[[Image:Huygens surface color.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The surface of Titan.]]
Titan is the only moon in the Solar System to have a thick atmosphere. Until the Cassini spacecraft arrived in orbit around Saturn, we did not know what the surface looked like. The ground is very cold on Titan, and all of the water is frozen. The surface looks like it is smooth, with areas of light and dark material. Most of the craters have been filled in.

It was thought that Titan may have seas of liquid methane, but it now looks like there may only be a few lakes. The Huygens probe was dropped into the atmosphere of Titan and slowly fell to the ground. This gave us our first close-up pictures of the surface. These showed what appear to be channels among hills that lead down to flat regions below. These may have been made by flows of liquid that left dark materials behind.

An atmosphere, complex molecules and the presence of methane on Titan mean that many people think there may be simple forms of life on or under Titan's surface.

==How long is a day on Titan?==
A day on Titan is the same as the time it takes for the moon to orbit around Saturn, about 15 days, 22 hours, and 41 minutes. The same side of Titan always faces toward Saturn, in much the same way as the same face of our Moon always points toward the Earth. This was caused by the gravity of Saturn creating a tidal force on Titan, which changed its rotation.

==What is it made of?==
The atmosphere of Titan is mostly nitrogen, with small amounts of other gases. Many of these gases are called '''hydrocarbons''' because they include hydrogen and carbon. These hydrocarbons are created in the upper atmosphere from Ultraviolet sunlight. Ultraviolet is the same light that causes sunburn on your skin. The hydrocarbons create a thick orange smog that hides the surface. 

The moon is made of about half ice and half rocks. Most of this rock may be in a core at the center of the moon. The core may still be hot, as is the core of our own world, and there could be some volcanic activity. The surface is mostly ice.

==How much would Titan's gravity pull on me?==
The gravitational pull on Titan is about one seventh the Earth's gravitational pull. So if you weighed 100 pounds here you would weigh 14 pounds on Titan.

==Who is it named after?==
Titan was named after the race of children borne by Gaea and Ouranos in Greek mythology.

==When was it discovered?==
It was discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.

I can't remember the formal definition but &lt;math&gt;x^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit of &lt;math&gt;x^1, x^{1.4}, x^{1.41}, x^{1.414}, x^{1.4142}\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.-- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 21:30, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

== Old introduction to indices. ==

I tried writing my own introduction as I found this one a little wordy. 

You are probably already familiar with indices, for example &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is just a shorter way of writing &lt;math&gt;x \times x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; is similarly &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;. With &lt;math&gt;x^5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called the base and &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is called the power or exponent. &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; is pronounced &quot;x to the four&quot;, or &quot;x raised to the 4th power&quot; in full. Some powers are so useful that they have special names: &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as &quot;x squared&quot;, &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;x cubed&quot; and &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (which you will soon learn about if you haven't already encountered it) is called &quot;the reciprocal of x&quot;.

'''Note:''' The &quot;law of indices&quot; is sometimes also called the &quot;exponent laws&quot; or &quot;power rules&quot;. More generally, an [[w:index|index]] in mathematics is a [[w:superscript|superscript]] or [[w:subscript|subscript]] to a symbol.

Using this notation you might notice several patterns.

==== Division by Zero ====

Please be careful - x^4 / x is not x^3 if x is zero, as the division has undefined value. Simmilarly, x^2 times x^-1 is not x if x is zero, but rather is undefined for x^-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The  Pythagorean Theorem ==


The Pythagorean Theorem shows the relationship between the sides (a and b) and the hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle. The right triangle I will be using is shown below.
[[Image:Isosceles right triangle.svg|none|thumb|150px|A Right Triangle]]
The Pythagorean Theorem states that, ''in a right triangle,''the square of a (a²) plus the square of b (b²) is equal to the square of c (c²).
 
&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2 &lt;/math&gt;


''Summary'': The Pythagorean Theorem is a²+b²=c², or leg² + leg² = hyp². It works only for right triangles.

== Proof of the Pythagorean Theorem ==

Now that we know the Pythagorean Theorem, take a look at the following diagram.
[[Image:Pythagorean Theorem Proof.png|frame|none|A diagram.]]
Look at the large square. The large square's area can be written as:

'''(a+b)(a+b)'''

or as:

'''(a+b)²'''

since each side's length is (a+b).
Look at the tilted square in the middle. Its area can be written as:

'''c².'''

Now, look at each of the triangles at the corners of the large square. Each triangle's area is:

'''½ab'''

There are four triangles, so the area of all four of them combined is:

'''4(½ab)'''

The area of the large square is equal to the area of the four triangles plus the area of the tilted square.
This can be written as:

'''(a+b)²=c²+4(½ab)'''

Using [[Algebra]], this can be simplified.

       (a+b)²=c²+4(½ab)
       (a+b)(a+b)=c²+2ab  
       a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2ab++b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=c²+2ab

  -2ab      -2ab

a²+b²=c²

Now we can see why the Pythagorean Theorem works, or, in other words, we can see proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.

''However, this proof is not based on Euclidean Geometry. It is not elementary.''

There are thousands more proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, too.
*You should be able to explain why the following is proof of the Pythagorean Theorem:
[[Image:Pythangorean Proof alt.svg|frame|none|Another proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.]]

''Summary'': The Pythagorean Theorem can be proved using diagrams.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Translations, Reflections and Rotations==
Before we continue, you need to know what Translations, Reflections, and Rotations are.
Let us start with the following image of a triangle.
[[Image:Congruent1.PNG|frame|none|A diagram of our image.]]
*''Translation'' means moving the image horizontally (along the x axis) or vertically (along the y axis).
[[Image:Congruent2.PNG|frame|none|A translation of our image.]]
The image above was translated a few units horizontally (along the x axis) and a few units vertically (along the y axis).
*''Reflection'' means flipping the image either over the x axis (a horizontal line) or over the y axis (a vertical line).
[[Image:Congruent3.PNG|frame|none|A reflection of our image.]]
The image above was flipped over the x axis (a horizontal line).
*''Rotation'' means moving the image from a pivot point.
[[Image:Congruent4.PNG|frame|none|A rotation of our image.]]
The image above was rotated 90 degrees clockwise from a certain pivot point.

Notice that in all of the operations performed on the triangle above, none of the operations changed the angles of the triangle, or the lengths of any of the line segments.  In all of the operations shown above, the only things that change are the location of the three points that make up the triangle.

Translations, reflections and rotations do not fundamentally change a shape.  Terms for shapes that undergo any of these transformations are covered in the next section.

==Congruence and Similarity==

Intuitively, ''congruent'' shapes are shapes that are '''exactly the same'''.  Technically speaking, two shapes are congruent if you can translate, rotate and/or reflect one of them in such a way that it coincides exactly with the other shape.  Hence, a shape may be translated, reflected or rotated and remain congruent to its counterpart.
[[Image:Congruent5.PNG|frame|none|Congruent triangles]]
These two triangles above are congruent, even though they are rotations of each other.

''Similar'' shapes are shapes that, when scaled, are exactly the same. A shape may be translated, reflected or rotated and remain similar to its counterpart. In a sense, similar shapes are '''scale models''' of each other, that is, they are '''proportional'''.
[[Image:Similar1.PNG|frame|none|Similar triangles]]
These triangles are similar because when one is scaled down, reflected, and rotated, it becomes congruent with the other.

==Vocabulary==
*'''Congruent Shapes''' - Shapes that coincide exactly when translated, reflected, and/or rotated.
*'''Similar Shapes''' - Shapes that coincide exactly when translated, reflected, rotated and/or scaled.

==Exercises==
1) On graph paper, draw a triangle with the points (0, 0), (0, 15) and (15, 0).  Draw the triangle reflected over the Y axis (the vertical axis).  Draw the triangle translated up 25 units.

2) On graph paper, draw a square with the points (0, 0), (0, 15), (15, 15) and (15, 0).  When you scale this shape by any amount, what happens to the point at (0, 0)?

3)On graph paper, draw a square with the points (0, 0), (0, 6), (6, 6) and (6, 0).  When you scale this shape by 2, what happens to the point at (0, 6)?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Light is a medium of energy through which we perceive and interact with our environment. It is the visible frequency range of electromagnetic radiation which also includes invisible forms of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet, infrared, and radio waves.

Like all electromagnetic radiation, light is transmitted by individual packets (or quanta) of energy known as photons. These photons are the units by which the combined forces of electricity and magnetism are communicated between other particles, such as the electrons associated with an atom. Depending on the circumstances under which it is observed, a photon can behave like a particle or as a wave. This principle is known as wave-particle duality.

==Wave properties==
The wave-like nature of electromagnetic radiation means it can be plotted on a graph as an oscillating electric and magnetic field at right angles to the direction of travel of the wave. The frequency of these oscillations is measured in the number of complete cycles per second, or hertz. The particular frequency of a photon places it somewhere on a spectrum of possible frequencies. This is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. The range of frequencies that form the visual spectrum lies between 3.8&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; hertz (dark red) and 7.5&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; hertz (violet).

The speed of light, given the symbol '''c''', has been precisely measured as 299,792,458 m/s or approximately three hundred thousand kilometers per second and has been demonstrated to be constant in a vacuum. A vacuum being defined for the purposes of theory and experimentation as a volume of space that is essentially empty of matter. The speed of light is a fundamental constant of modern physics and remains constant regardless of the movement of the observer. Thus, for example, if you were somehow able to travel at half the speed of light, and you measured how quickly light was arriving from the front, you would measure it as arriving at the speed of light (3.00 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s).

Since the speed of light is a constant in a vacuum, for a given frequency a photon will have a corresponding wavelength, or the distance between the crests of the wave. The frequency and wavelength of light are directly related by the following equation:


:&lt;math&gt; c = f \cdot ~\lambda \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


where ''c'' is the conventional symbol for the speed of light, usually in meters per second, ''f'' is the frequency of light in hertz, and &amp;lambda; is the wavelength in meters.

Given the speed of light as 3.00&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; meters per second, then the wavelength range for the visual spectrum is about 400 to 800 nm, or nanometers. (A nanometer is 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; meters, or one-billionth
of a meter.)

The shorter wavelength of 400 nm corresponds to the greater frequency, and is located at the blue end of the visual spectrum. Likewise the longer wavelength of 800 nm belongs to the red end of the spectrum. The actual energy of the photon increases with decreasing wavelength (or increasing frequency.)

Einstein won the Nobel Prize for applying Planck's theories to electromagnetism.

==Intensity==
The intensity of a source of radiation is the energy it emits per unit of surface area per unit of time and has the units of Joules/(meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x second). As the energy radiated by a spherical surface, I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, moves away from that surface the radiation intensity decreases as the inverse of the distance squared (I=I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) because the radiation spreads out. In other words, the perceived intensity of a light source by an observer is inversely proportional to the distance from the light source squared. Thus for each doubling of distance from the source, the intensity drops by a factor of four, or 2 &amp;times; 2.

The brightness of stellar objects, such as a star, are determined by the amount of light they radiate and their distance from the Earth. A bright star in the sky might actually be much more distant than an a dimmer star, but because it is more intense and radiates a greater amount of light it appears to be closer.

Astronomers record the light intensity of a stellar object as a numerical ''magnitude''. The magnitude is a number on a logarithm scale that has been standardized, so that 5 steps in magnitude is equal to a multiple of 100 in intensity. In addition, the value of the magnitude ''increases'' as the intensity of the light source ''decreases''.

Thus a star of magnitude 2.0 is dimmer than a star of magnitude 1.0. A magnitude 1.0 star is also 100 times as bright as a magnitude 6.0 star. Each +1.0 magnitude increase is the same as dividing the intensity by 2.512.

The reference point for the magnitude scale is set to zero. At one time this was based on the star Vega, or &amp;alpha; Lyrae. The brightest star Sirius (&amp;alpha; Canis Majoris) has a magnitude of −1.46. The limiting magnitude for a typical person's unaided eye is considered to be 6.0. However people have observed stars fainter than this under good conditions. Much fainter stars can be seen by using the larger collection area of a telescope and the extended recording ability of a camera.

==Reflection==
A mirror is a flat or curved surface usually made out of a highly-conductive material, such as a metal. When light interacts with a mirrored surface, it undergoes specular reflection. That is, a beam of light striking the mirror is reflected in only one direction. This direction is determined by the ''law of reflection'', which states that the angle with the surface at which the light is reflected is the same as the angle with the surface at which it approaches.

{| width=&quot;450&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[Image:Mirror image reversal.svg]]
|-
|''In this illustration, the reflected light rays reaching the eye from an object produce the illusionary appearance of a reversed-image object behind the mirror.''
|}

The movement of a photon with respect to the mirror consists of two components. The first is the proportion of the movement parallel to the mirror, and the second is the portion perpendicular to the mirror. After the reflection, the portion parallel to the mirror is unchanged. However the portion perpendicular is now in the opposite direction. That is, it effectively &quot;bounces&quot; off the surface almost as a rubber ball bounces off the ground.

When light interacts with a surface that is not reflective, a portion of the light is absorbed by the surface and the remainder is scattered in random directions. This type of reflection is called ''diffuse'', and it is responsible for the illumination effect of ambient light.

The portion of light absorbed by a surface is termed its ''albedo''. The lower the albedo rating, the less light it reflects in a diffuse manner. A surface with a low albedo rating appears dark to an observer, while a high albedo rating appears light. The albedo rating of a surface can tell an astronomer something about the nature of the surface. For example, a surface covered with carbon soot will have a low albedo, while an icy surface has a higher albedo.

==Refraction==
When light passes at an angle through a transparent medium, the material causes the photons to change direction slightly. This change in angle is called refraction, and the angle by which the light is bent is determined by the ''index of refraction'' of the material.

{| width=&quot;357&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[Image:Example snells law.gif]]
|-
|''In this illustration, the indicent beam of light strikes a glass surface at an angle &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. A portion of the light energy is refracted through the glass at angle &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Most of the remaining light energy is reflected at angle &amp;theta;'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.''
|}

The index of refraction of the two materials that the light passes between can be used to determine the change in angle by means of ''Snell's law''. For materials with indices of refraction ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', the angle in the first material ''&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' determines the angle in the new material ''&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' as follows:


:&lt;math&gt;n_1\cdot\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\cdot\sin(\theta_2)\, &lt;/math&gt;


Here are the indices of refraction (at a wavelength of 589 nm) for some common transparent materials relative to a vacuum:

===Spectrum===
For a given transparent material, such as glass, the refraction of light varies with frequency. A white light consists of photons of various energies. The red photons in the light will be deflected at a different angle than the blue photons.

If the light passes through a transparent material with parallel sides, such as a sheet of glass, the beam will emerge at the same angle as it entered. However when the two sides are not parallel, the angle will vary depending on the frequency. This is the principle behind the prism. A glass prism is used to separate the photons from a light source into a spectrum of frequencies from red to blue. A similar principle is what creates a rainbow as the light from the sun passes through droplets of water.

{| width=&quot;400&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|[[Image:Refraction varies by frequency.gif|400px]]
|-
|''The index of refraction varies by frequency, causing parallel, monochromatic light rays from the left to emerge from the prism at different angles.''
|}

An instrument specifically designed to display the spectrum of a radiating object, such as a star, is called a ''spectroscope''.

The early spectroscopes were constructed using a series of prisms that would successively spread the spectrum further apart. The problem with this arrangement, however, is that each of the prisms would absorb some of the light passing through. This limited the brightness of the objects that could be observed. An instrument called a diffraction grating, which was a mirror with a series of ruled parallel grooves, used the principle of diffraction to produce a spectrum with only minor loss of intensity.

Isaac Newton discovered that a light beam can be diffracted only so far, and no farther. The diffraction can be recombined into white light.

===Lens===
The lens takes advantage of the property of refraction to bend the light from a distant object and to make it appear closer (or more distant). A lens is, in a simplified sense, a prism that has been &quot;wrapped&quot; around in a circle, so that the light is bent symmetrically.

Because light of different frequencies is bent at different angles, however, the point at which the light comes to a focus varies with frequency. An observer looking through a lens would see light sources near the edge have a rainbow-like appearance. This is called ''chromatic aberration''.

To adjust for this variation in the focus by frequency, opticians typically use combinations of lenses made of different materials (with differing indices of refraction). Judicious use of materials and lens shapes will result in a lens that focuses all the light at the same distance, producing a good quality image that does not suffer from chromatic aberration.

==Magnification==
When you observe an object nearby, it subtends an certain angle within your sight. That is, if you had an imaginary line running from the top of the object and your eye and a similar line from the bottom of the object to your eye, there would be a certain angle between these lines.

As the object recedes into the distance, the angle it subtends across your sight steadily decreases until it becomes nearly a point. The imaginary lines from the top and bottom of the object are now nearly parallel. In fact, for an astronomical object such as a star, these lines are essentially parallel.

In order to enlarge the appearance of an object, it is necessary to modify the paths of the incoming light rays so that they are no longer parallel but instead arrive at an angle as they enter your eyes. The eye then perceives the object as if it were much closer.

There are two common means for causing the parallel light rays to converge in this manner. The first involves the use of a curved, concave mirror. The second takes advantage of the refraction ability of materials such as glass to redirect the light inward at an angle.

The shape of glass needed to accomplish this is a convex lens. The portions of the lens near the center need little curvature since they will are required to bend the light only slightly toward your eye. At the edges of the lens, however, the light needs to be bent at a sharper angle, so the sides of the lens become bent toward each other like a prism. Overall the sides of the lens form a smooth curve that gradually increases in slope toward its edges.

A well-made convex lens will cause the parallel light from a distant light source to focus at a point. When there are multiple such light sources, they are each focused at a point on a plane, known as the ''focal plane''. The human eye can perceive the image of this plane, and the result is a magnification of the view. If the images do not focus on a plane, then the image will appear blurry.

==Diffraction==
Another wave-like property of light is a tendency to bend and spread whenever it meets an obstacle. Any beam of light will also tend to spread with distance, so that it becomes impossible to maintain a tight beam of an arbitrary length. The property of diffraction is what limits the resolution of a distant object.

When a beam of coherent light, such as that produced by a laser, is passed through two slit openings, the light radiates from the slits like ripples in a pond. The semi-circular ripples from the two slits interact with each other, sometimes adding together their wave heights and at other times cancelling each other out. This is called constructive and destructive interference. If a screen is placed in the area where these ripples interact, alternating bands of light and darkness would appear.

===Resolution===
The resolution of a viewing instrument is a measurement of how well it can be used to distinguish two points that are very close together. For example, the two points could be the two stars in a binary star system. In astronomy, resolution is usually measured in ''seconds of arc''. The resolution can vary depending on a number of environmental and quality conditions, but it is always limited by the aperture of the observing instrument. That is, there is a best possible resolution that any particular telescope can achieve. To get better resolution, a larger aperture is needed.

To see why this is so, imagine a telescope that consists of only two vertical slits separated by some distance, with a viewing screen behind. When the light from a distance star enters this telescope, it passes through the slits and forms an interference pattern on the screen. The distance between the light and dark bands is proportional to the wavelength of the light and inversely proportional to the distance between the slits. Thus increasing the separation of the slits will reduce the width of each band.

Now suppose there are two stars. They will both form bands of light and dark light on the screen, which may overlap. The closer the two stars are two each other, the closer their interference bands approach until they become indistinguishable. But if the separation of the slits is increased, then the bands become  narrower and the stars can be distinguished again. This is the principle behind the interferometer.

===Interferometer===
In an ordinary telescope, the resolution is determined by the aperture. In this respect, a telescope can be thought of as a whole series of slits allowing light through, with the light at the outer edge providing the maximum resolution. The resolution of the telescope can be improved by adding a set of mirrors outside the maximum aperture that collect peripheral light rays, and effectively increase the aperture.

Similarly, two or more telescopes can be configured to work together and provide an aperture at least equal to the separation of their collecting surfaces. This setup is called an ''interferometer'', because the images from both telescopes are integrated through a process of diffraction interference. Radio telescopes have successfully used this technique for many years to achieve very high levels of resolution. Optical interferometers are more difficult to build due to the requirements for extreme precision and the need to dampen out any vibrations.

===Reflection gratings===
Reflection gratings are surfaces that have been very precisely ruled with a series of parallel grooves. The grooves have a saw-tooth pattern, with each groove consisting of a long flat surface machined at a slight angle, with a sharp step at the edge. Each of the grooves is very narrow, with about 600 lines per mm (15,000 per inch).

As light is reflected from each of the grooves, it is slightly behind the light from the adjacent grooves. This difference produces an interference effect that reinforces the light at certain angles and cancels out the light at others. The grating is very efficient at destructively interfering with the light except at one particular angle, where the light constructively interferes and produces a peak intensity. The angle of this peak varies by the wavelength of the light, so a spectrum is produced.

==Polarization==
In addition to a direction of travel, a photon is composed of an electric and magnetic field. These lie at right angles to each other and to the direction of travel. This is known as a ''transverse wave''. These perpendicular fields give the photon an orientation. The fields of each photon will maintain their orientation while traveling in a vacuum. Fields of this type are called ''plane-polarized''.

Normally light from a source consists of a large number of photons that have a random polarization. However, it is possible for a number of the photons to become oriented in the same direction, becoming ''polarized''. This coherent orientation can be detected by means of a sheet of polarizing material. When the sheet is oriented in the direction of the polarization, the polarized light passes through. As the sheet is rotated, it transmits a decreasing portion of the polarized light until finally, at right angles to the plane of polarization, it blocks all of the polarized light.

Light can become partly polarized by reflecting from a surface, such as sunlight reflecting off a pool of water. Reflected sunlight provides a source of glare for somebody driving a vehicle. Because this light is partially polarized, the use of polarized sunglasses helps reduce glare by blocking the polarized light preferentially.

Astronomers can examine a stellar light source to determine whether it is a source of polarized light. The presence of polarization is an indication of certain physical properties in effect at the source of the light, or along the line of sight of the light rays. For example, a magnetic field can polarize a light source, as can the acceleration of an electron to a velocity near the speed of light.

==Spectral lines==
When an atom absorbs a photon of light, the energy is forces the absorbing electron in the atom into an excited state. The electron changes its behavior, effectively becoming more energized and entering a new orbital pattern about the nucleus. A sufficiently energetic photon, or a combination of photons with enough energy, can even knock the electron from the atom. The atom then becomes ionized and gains a net positive charge.

Due to the quantum nature of small particles, the changes in energy allowed for an electron in an atom is fixed to very specific amounts. When a photon of just this energy is captured by the electron, it is must jump to a new and higher energy level. Thus each atom has a specific set of energy bands where it will favorably absorb photons, depending on the current energy states of its electrons.

When a white light is passed through a gas composed of the same type of atom, those atoms will tend to absorb light at those frequencies that match the energies needed for their electrons to jump to a new level. An observer on the other side of the gas who looks at the spectrum will see dark lines where these energies have been absorbed. Likewise an observer looking at the gas from another angle will see bands of light where those same energy frequencies were emitted by the atoms.

This property of selective absorption of light at specific bands is important in astronomy because it allows an astronomer to determine the chemical properties of a distant object. A star, for example, will radiate a spectrum with strong or weak absorption bands, which are determined by the quantities of different gases on its surface. The science of recording and measuring these lines is called ''spectroscopy''.

==Doppler shift==
As an object moves toward us in space, it may radiate light in our direction. The velocity of the light we receive does not change. However, during the time interval between each of the peaks in the light wave it is transmitting, the object has moved slightly closer toward us. Thus the wavelength grows shorter and appears more blue than normal. Correspondingly, an object moving away from us will have its wavelength stretched out, making it appear more red.

This red-shift or blue-shift property has a number of important applications in astronomy. It can be used to measure the velocity with which a distant object, such as a galaxy, is moving toward or away from us. For objects that are rotating, we can measure the rate of rotation by comparing the blue shift on the edge rotating toward us to the red shift of the edge moving away. We have also discovered binary stars by the regular oscillation of the spectrum toward the blue or the red as the star orbits its companion.

==Spectrometry and Photometry==
Spectrometry involves looking at the spectra of light.  Spectra are
what you get when you take light from a source and spread out the
colors by passing the light through a prism or over a grating, and then
looking at the amount of light at a certain wavelength.  There is a
huge amount of information that you can get from doing this.

So let's take a spectroscope and point it at something like a
fluorescent light bulb or a nebula.  The thing that you will see is
that rather than a continuous rainbow of all colors or wavelengths,
the light is actually a combination of light from
different well defined wavelengths.  You will see lines.  

The reason for these lines is that the electrons in the gas in the
fluorescent lights can only be at certain energy levels.  When you do
something to energize the gas in a fluorescent bulb, the electrons in
the atom's gas move to higher energy orbits, which are known as excited
states.  They stay in those excited states for a length of time
ranging from milliseconds to seconds.  When the electrons drop from the high energy states to lower energy states, then they will emit light at
a wavelength that has an energy (and a corresponding wavelength) equal to the difference between the two energy states. This is known as an emission spectrum.

The detected spectra gives insight into the composition of the object
emitting the spectra.  Every element and material has its unique set
of energy levels and unique lines, and by comparing those the lines of
emission spectra with those of known elements, it's possible to discover the object's composition. 

When you add energy to an atom, the electrons move to a higher energy
state.  As the electron relaxes and moves down the energy states, it
emits a particle of light for each transition that it makes.  Since
every energy has a particular color associated with it, each
transition puts out light at a single wavelength.  The time between stimulation and re-emission is very rapid (in like a microsecond), but there are some materials in which the transition from a high energy state to a low energy state takes a long time.  An example of this is glow in the dark stickers.  When you expose it to light, it kicks some of the electrons into high energy levels, and it takes seconds to minutes for the electrons to revert to their original state.

One can discover other things about an object from its spectrum.  For
example, as you increase the temperature, you end up with more and
more electrons in higher energy states and this affects the spectrum
in that you end up with stronger lines.  But if you increase the
temperature past a certain point, the electrons leaves the atom
completely and the lines become weaker.  

You can also discover the pressure and density of the
object.  As the pressure and density increase, there is a increased chance that particle interactions will change the electrons' energy states to higher or lower level. This causes the lines to grow wider since there is a higher chance that the electron won't start
and finish at a particular energy level.

If you increase the pressure and density enough the electrons no
longer have enough time to stay at a certain energy level, and so the
lines broaden to form what is known as a continuous spectrum, A
continuous spectrum is emitted by a solid, liquid, or high pressure
gas.  Because the electron is no longer restricted to certain energy
levels and certain wavelengths, the electron will often emit a low
energy infrared photon rather than a photon of light.  As a result
something that is emitting a continuous spectrum (like a light bulb,
specifically an incandescent light bulb) will emit much of its energy at lower frequencies (called heat) compared to something that is emitting a more discrete spectrum (like a fluorescent light bulb).  Since energy is conserved, a fluorescent light bulb emits almost all its energy at a few wavelengths very efficiently while an incandescent light bulb emits much of its energy as heat. Hence, a florescent bulb will convert electrical energy into light more efficiently.  

There is one more type of spectrum which is very common.  If you
expose a gas to light of different wavelengths and one of those
wavelengths happens to match a difference in energy levels in the gas, it will absorb the
light at that particular wavelength.  So, if you have a source of a
continuous spectrum pass it into cool gas in front of it, you produce what is known as an absorption spectrum.  Most stars emit absorption
spectrum as the cool upper layers of the stars absorb lines from the
light emitted by the hot lower levels of the star.

So far we have been talking just about visible light, but the principles of
spectroscopy apply to other types of electromagnetic radiation, of which visible
light is just a small slice in the overall range of wavelengths. You can have gamma ray
or X ray spectra (at shorter wavelengths than visible light)
as well as microwave and infrared spectra (at longer
wavelengths than visible light).  The big difference has to do with what generates the radiation.  The energy differences between different states of an atom typically are the energy of a particle of visible light.  An X-ray photon will knock the electron right out of an atom, as a result an X-ray can't be generated by electrons transitioning between atomic energy levels. However, X-rays are generated when atomic nuclei transition between different nuclear energy levels.  Conversely, microwave radiation can be generated when molecules move between energy states as they &quot;wiggle.&quot; So by observing microwaves you can detect cool clouds of molecular gas by detecting microwaves in the spectrum.  Conversely by
sending microwaves into something that contains water the molecules will be induced to &quot;wiggle&quot; or in other words heat up. At the same time, the microwaves will pass through things (air or ceramic) whose energy levels don't match the microwaves.  So if you put something like a cup of coffee in a microwave oven, all of the energy will be absorbed by the coffee and not by the cup or the air.

One final thing about spectroscopy.  Spectrographs are affected by so many things and that every object out there has a different spectrum, and understanding what affects spectrographs and how to glean this
information from spectrographs is an important part of astronomy.

== Discussion questions ==

The stellar classification system from hottest to coolest is
OBAFGKM with A being the star with the strongest hydrogen line, B
being next strongest and so forth.  Why is the stellar classification
in this order rather than the more logical order of temperature?
Discuss a case from your experience in which a similar reason has led
to seemingly odd classification systems.

Identify three objects and tell me whether they would result in
an emission, continuous, or absorption spectrum.  Also tell me what
you would see if you pointed a spectroscope at you.  Would you see an
emission, continuous, or absorption spectrum?

What type of spectrum do you suppose an LCD puts out?  What
about gold?  What about a microwave oven?  What about you?

Using your knowledge of advances in photography, how do you
suppose an astronomer takes a spectrum differently today than in
1920?  What about 1850?  How do you think the Internet can be used to
help astronomers take spectra?

Why do you think it is so tough to create a good looking
fluorescent light bulb and how do you think that they do it.

If I stand in front of 100 watts of radio waves or light waves,
nothing bad happens to me.  But if I stand in front of 100 watts of
gamma rays or X-rays, bad things will happen to me.  Why?

Thanks.

Methinks you knock the clinical psychologist too much.  A ''good'' clinical psychologist can be better than a psychiatrist, and is certainly likely to be more competent to diagnose and treat it, follow up, or provide referrals than a GP.  Remember clinical psychologists are dealing head-on with depressed patients every day, whereas the typical GP is rarely qualified to provide specialized care for mental disorders.

Finally, there is the issue of cost and all that entails.  Many patients are lucky if they can see a (hopefully) licensed counsellor without any advanced degrees whatsoever.  It is a rare patient who has the money or the insurance to cover extended sessions with a psychiatrist.  This means that encounters with HMO psychiatrists may be limited to lots of form diagnostics, brief interviews, and dispensing of pills, whereas a wider range of treatment including talk therapy may be accessible from a psychologist.

===Role of Medical Insurance on over prescription of Pharmaceudical Treatments===

How about a note on the role that Medical Insurance Companies play in the over-emphasis on Pharmaceudical treatments.  Insurance companies place heavy pressure on proffesionals to seek the minimal cost method of treatment.  Often they argue that Pharmaceudical Treatments are more cost effective, while clearly ignoring the ineffectiveness of these Pharmaceudical treatments in the long term and the dangerous repercussions that occur when these drugs do at last fail (often due to natural adaptation).  Countless people suffering from depression have been left without appropriate knowledge of cognitive coping techniques that a qualified Clinical Psychologist can teach.  In many cases, had more importance been placed on these cognative techniques lives could have been saved.  Shouldn't insurance companies be obliged to seek the most effective method and not just the cheapest.  The practice of saving a few dollars at the cost of human lives is extremely offensive to me.  Throughout my educational career in Psychology I have repetatively heard this problem expressed by numerious Professors, isnt it time something was done about this obviously incorrect and ill-informed emphasis on the wrong treatment.--[[User:Scottmcmaster|Scottmcmaster]] 06:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

== My opinion ==

In my opinion introduction is sweet when it is short and which is direct to the point by using clear short words.
I think, when long sentences with too many words are used it makes confusion and it can give worst effect to a person whose mental status is not very clear.
As I understand, there are two separate headings with similar meanings, ie. &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;what is depression&quot;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Comment 01:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Bio-medical terminologies in sentences are not suggesting any crystal clear &quot;to the point&quot; &quot;instruction/suggestion/opinion&quot;.
  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Suggestion:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
According to World Health Organization (W.H.O): &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Depression is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;common mental disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration.&quot;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt; (D.S.M. related things are too complicated for non-related person so W.H.O will be sufficient. ) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Depression occurs in persons of all genders, ages, and backgrounds.

Facts
* Depression is common, affecting about 121 million people worldwide.
* Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide.
* Depression can be reliably diagnosed and treated in primary care.
* Fewer than 25 % of those affected have access to effective treatments.

(Source: WHO &quot;www.who.int and word searched - depression&quot;)

&lt;b&gt;Q. What is depression? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Q. What Can I Do When My Family Member Is Depressed? &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Common Symptoms of Depression: &lt;/b&gt;
#Feeling sad, blue, or down 
#Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities
#Change in appetite or weight 
#Change in sleep patterns 
#Feeling tired and slowed down OR feeling restless
#Feeling worthless or guilty
#Trouble concentrating, thinking, or making decisions
#Thoughts of death or suicide

&lt;b&gt;Common Causes of Depression &lt;/b&gt;
#Major life events (e.g., death of loved one, retirement) &lt;br&gt;
#Genetic factors &lt;br&gt;
#Imbalance in the level of chemicals in the brain. &lt;br&gt;
#Medical illness &lt;br&gt;
#Use of certain medications (some anti-convulsants or thyroid hormones) &lt;br&gt;
#Excessive use of alcohol &lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Suicide Warning Signs: &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;

There are several red flags that you want to pay special attention to if a loved one is talking about suicide. One warning sign does NOT mean that the person is definitely going to harm him/herself; rather, these cues may prompt you to explore the issue further: &lt;br&gt;

#Changes in the level of depression (more depressed or happier than usual), especially if he/she: &lt;br&gt;
#*Has a specific plan for how they would kill themselves 
#*Begins to get their affairs in order (e.g., writes a will, gives things away, systematically contacts old friends or relatives) 
#*Feels worthless 
#*Talks about having done an unforgivable behavior 
#*Feels hopeless about the future 
#*Hears voices telling them to harm themselves
#Talks about being indestructible or having supernatural powers during a manic or delusional state 
#Talks about killing him/herself (&quot;everyone would be better off without me&quot;) 
#Makes suicidal gestures (takes too many pills, cuts wrists, etc.) 
#Increases use of alcohol or other drugs. 
#Has previously attempted suicide OR has a history of being impulsive

&lt;b&gt;What to do if your family member is suicidal &lt;/b&gt;
#TALK ABOUT IT! Asking about suicide will NOT put ideas in their head and will not make the situation worse. Ask - then listen. You may want to discuss coping strategies at a time when your loved one is not actively suicidal. 
#Offer emotional support by expressing your concern, care, and willingness to help. 
#Ask if they have a plan about how they are thinking about killing themselves. If so, then: 
#*Seek professional help immediately 
#*Try to get the person to make an agreement with you that they will not act on these plans without first talking to you, a hotline, or mental health professional 
#*Put away any objects that they may use to harm themselves (guns, knives, pills, razors, etc)
#If the person is delusional, seek professional help. 
#If you don't know what to do, call a professional (e.g., suicide hotline, mental health professional, police)

For an example:
oNational SUICIDE Hotline: 1-800-SUICIDE 
oSuicide hotline in Oklahoma City: (405) 848-CARE 

&lt;b&gt;Local Treatment Options for Veterans Struggling with Depression &lt;/b&gt;
#Individual / Group Psychotherapy 
#Psychoeducational Classes 
#Day Treatment Center 
#Anti-depressant Medications 
#Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

&lt;b&gt;DO's &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Acknowledge that depression is a legitimate illness - which is different from just having a &quot;down&quot; day.

Have realistic expectations…but maintain hope! &lt;br&gt;
Be an active team member in the care of your loved one. Ask questions of doctors, nurses, psychologists, and other health care providers. &lt;br&gt;
Offer emotional support, patience, and compassion. Encourage your loved one to exercise and do activities that he/she used to enjoy. &lt;br&gt;
Stay in contact with your social support network. &lt;br&gt;
Obtain professional help for yourself when needed. &lt;br&gt;
Maintain good sleep habits, both for you and your loved one. &lt;br&gt;
Maintain a healthy diet; engage in regular exercise; avoid use of alcohol. &lt;br&gt;
 

&lt;b&gt; DON'Ts &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Try not to take the depression personally - it's not your fault! You cannot cure depression with love any more than you can cure cancer with love. &lt;br&gt;
Don't exclude the depressed person from family discussions or decisions. &lt;br&gt;
Don't try to do everything for the depressed person. &lt;br&gt;
Don't criticize the person for their depressed behavior. &lt;br&gt;
Don't feel that you need to apologize for your loved one. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt; Normal Neuron Communication: The Role of Serotonin &lt;/b&gt;

As you wrote as your introduction &quot;&lt;i&gt;This article is not written by a doctor. The recommendations are not referenced to actual research except in a bibliography. This document should in no way serve as a substitute for medical advice. Doctors and experts are welcome to add their comments at ...&lt;/i&gt;&quot; 

Why serotonin should be mentoined in this topic at this time? And what effect is expected by introducing a &quot;serotonin&quot; to a depressed brain?
Practically not a very brilliant idea.
(In my experience - Depressed brain seldom asks about interpretation of SEROTONIN. It is not a very polite idea to give them big theories while they are suffering)


&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Comment 03:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;By writing this document we hope to provide you with the knowledge everyone should have about their mental well-being. Depression is not an unavoidable fate. It is physical.&lt;/u&gt; &quot;

You wrote &quot;&lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;&quot; ... Who is your address? &quot;&lt;i&gt;It is physical&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Physical?

== Feedback and completion: Cortisol - damage neurones - impact on metabolism of the brain - result - symptoms called depression ==


I am working at the subject &quot;depression&quot; and in this content I found this article. It´s great, especially if I compare the content with all the books and articles I ever have read about this topic. What I miss is a more accurate description about what produces stress by people or the other way round, what makes it, that some people are less vulnerable to stress. And further there are some things, which a helpful in dealing with stress. (Nourishment, sport, love of oneself, etc.) 

I by myself have experienced a severe clinical depression as result of &quot;doing to much&quot; and as you wrote, one of the most interesting things for one who has gone through this horrible experience is the question: What has it caused? 

For me I miss in your thinking almost only the question: &quot;What happens to the brain and body, when there is a high level of cortisol in our blood?&quot;. Cortisol has an negative impact on our cells respectively our neurons. Study´s show, that persons after a very stressful or traumatic  event have almost no activity in their brain. This studies also show, that it took months till the activity of their brain becomes gradually normal. In my point of view cortisol (produced by stress) damages the neurones of our brain, what causes the situation that the metabolism in the brain can´t work any longer correct, what results in a lack of energy and the symptoms of this are called &quot;Depression&quot;.</text>

A man and his young son are driving to the city. On their way over the traintracks, the car stalls. Before the son and man can get out, they are hit by the train. The man is instantly killed (the examiner pronounced him dead upon impact), while the son, while horribly injured, remains alive.

The son is rushed to the hospital, where the doctors decide he needs surgery right away if he is to live. He is rushed to the OR, where the he waits for the surgeon. The old surgeon hobbles in, takes one look at the boy, and says, &quot;I cannot operate on this boy. He is my son.&quot;

How is this possible?

==Recipes==

Hi!
I saw your change to [[Template:Recipe]] (changing Category:Recipe to Category:Recipes). At some point I was encouraged to use a new category (Recipe) to index everything, which is why that was the listed Category in the template. You seem to have a lot of wikipedia experience; what's the standard over there? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:03, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

p.s. Thanks for doing so much indexing &amp; categorization.

:: I forgot to mention the supposed distinction between Category:Recipe and Category:Recipes. Category:Recipes was seen as a supercategory for other category types (Recipes by diet, Recipes by origin, etc). Category:Recipe was a new category to make a usable recipe index. You should read the [[Talk:Cookbook]] page if you have time, I'd like as many views as possible on the potential structuring of recipes. Thanks! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:25, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== In case you're still here ==

I don't know how much good trying to find info about the Beck Foundation will get you. I have tried a few times since my start here at WB, but to no avail. Some have even said there is no money left, and that the Beck Foundation has become defunct, so we have no money for this project. I agree that the Solar System book is probably more publishable right now. I guess we just wait to hear back from Danny. BTW... thank you so much for your work on these books. You are a valuable asset to Wikibooks. See you around. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:30, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Beck Foundation, Deadline for Wikijunior, and more ==

It figures that it was Zanimum that was doing this.  I've already publicly gone after him for trying to ram-rod a new Wikimedia project (in the form of Wikijunior) with supposed community concensus when in fact there is none (or very little, with no public discussion).  Anthere was quite... well... upset that this didn't have public concensus to create a whole new Wikimedia project just for Wikijunior.  There is a forum for doing that if he really wants it done, but he has chosen deliberately not to go that route, and the Foundation board is very cool to the idea of any new Wikimedia projects at the moment (they even turned down Wikiversity, dispite an absolutely huge turnout to get it going).

The concern that I have is that there is no infrastructure right now to actually wherehouse and distribute any physical books that are produced for this project.  I've done it on a very limited basis myself (by physically publishing the Wikijunior Solar System with a local printer) but I also did that on my own dime and have not asked for anything else from anybody.  I'm almost afraid that Zanimum wants to get the Beck Foundation to help pay for this but he can pocket the money... or at least there are no controls to insure that what is promised will happen.  He may be doing this completely on the up and up with the most noble motives in mind, but we need to get more stuff put together.

There is a page for [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]] that I've thought about really pushing hard on.  What we really need is a semi-commercial site for actually selling products.  There was an active URL some time ago at http://store.wikimedia.org/ but it has been discontinued.  Basically what we need to have is some way that we can publish content that is created on Wikibooks.  The best way I can see that started for now is to simply provide a bunch of PDFs for now (they aren't too hard to create in Open Office) that could be the basis for a Wikibook Press and eventually physical books as well.

I think that once we get a few books in the pipeline, we can keep this whole thing self-sustaining at least for gathering together the basic resources.  Publishing isn't cheap, however, and even the $10,000 from the Beck Foundation is only going to print up a few thousand books.  The other issue is trying to distribute the content and wherehouse the books immediately after printing but before distribution.  No printer will do direct distribution but will expect you to take them off their hands right away. (Well, Lulu press will, but they are also a distributor).  If we are going to give these books away (with a strong appearance of being a vanity press) that may be useful, but it should have a budget and be coordinated with the Wikimedia Foundation.  I don't see any of that happening right now.

In short, I think we have something cool with the current collection of Wikijunior books, but we are still at version 0.5 to 0.8 for all of current books, not the 1.0 that we need to do the job correctly.  I think it is also prudent to not rush this effort as going too quickly is going to backfire on us before we are ready.  If there is somebody from the Beck Foundation that wants to see specific results, I would like to see their commentary or at least somebody with formal ties to the Beck Foundation and showing their connection.  As it is right now, all we got are a bunch of people who are guessing in the dark about what is going to be expected.  In addition, we don't need the Beck Foundation to get any of this accomplished, but we need the Wikimedia Foundation in order to keep these servers running and we do need the Wikibooks community to keep fresh blood of new people coming into Wikijunior.  

If we want to set a realistic deadline and a specific order of accomplishment that can be met with volunteers on Wikijunior, I don't mind trying to set up those deadlines, with specific requests that certain modules will get done by a certain date, for example.  I just don't like seeing very unrealistic deadlines like three or four days away to perform proofreading and publishing that I would expect to be paid serious professional wages to accomplish, assuming that I even have the skills.  I've done projects on a professional basis with unrealistic deadlines like this, and the result was just raw garbage, not anything to be proud of.  It simply takes time to write a book, and progress is being made.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:53, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

:Hopefully this answers your questions. I am not sure ''anyone'' has been in contact with the Beck Foundation. Who really knows? This whole situation is a mess. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:53, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

And thanks for the maps for the various Big Cats modules. They significantly and immediately improve each book. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:45, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

----

Three men, who are not wearing glasses, are placed in a room without mirrors. A hat, which they cannot see, is placed on each of their heads.  The hat is either red or green in color.  They are not allowed to inspect their own hats in any way and are forbidden to talk or communicate in any way except as follows: if they see a red hat, they are to raise their right hand. If they figure out what colour their own hat is, they are to leave the room immediately without a word to anyone. They must stay in the room until they figure out what colour their own hat is, or until someone else does. After about ten minutes, one of the men figures it out and leaves the room. As it turns out, all the hats are red.

''How did he figure out what colour his own hat was?''

----
= Solution =
Person A (who figured it out) looked at Person B and Person C and thought to himself, &quot;Both these men are wearing red hats, and each of them sees the other man and I both have our hands up. If I were wearing a green hat, then person B would look at person C and see that Person C's hand was up, but not for me -- since my hat would be green. Therefore, he would immediately figure out his own hat was red and leave the room. But ten minutes have gone by and neither Person B nor Person C have figured out what would be an obvious conclusion; therefore, they're stuck ''because my hat is red, not green.''&quot;

= Longer explanation =

To solve this problem, we must answer the following question: what happens when the number of red hats is between 0 and 3?

''Case 1.'' If there are no red hats, then no man raises his hand, each man sees that the others do not raise their hands and thus concludes that his hat must be green, so he immediately leaves the room. This did not happen, so there is at least one red hat.

''Case 2.'' If there is exactly one red hat, then the man wearing the red hat does not raise his hand but the other two men do. The man wearing the red hat sees no red hats but does see the raised hands, so he concludes that his hat must be red and he leaves the room.

''Case 3.'' If there are exactly two red hats, then all hands are raised. Each red hat-wearing man sees a red and a green hat and deduces that his hat must be red because the other red hat-wearing man's hand is raised. Thus the two red hat-wearing men leave the room.

''Case 4.'' If there are three red hats, then all hands are raised, so cases 1 and 2 are eliminated. Each man sees that the other two men do not leave the room simultaneously. Since this must be the logical conclusion of case 3, there must be at least three red hats. Thus all men leave the room knowing their hat is red.

In order to arrive at the conclusion that only one man leaves the room, we conclude that the men reason logically at different rates and that the man to leave the room first has reasoned faster than the others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Beg to differ ==

Beg to differ with the idea that a return can be replaced by a goto to the end of the routine and be twice as readable: it is twice as much work for the code reader/modifier.  Many years of reading other folks code has shown that you cannot credulously take names at their word.  Dangerous assumption that a label EndOfRoutine is ACTUALLY at the end of the routine.  Programmers who think they know better or are just lazy may sneak a line or two of essential code in after this label.  Thus you must verify that this label is actually at the end of the routine, with no other statements after it, before it is known to have the same function as the return.  Return is clean and safe, can only mean one thing. (Alas for the wonderful DEC F77 labeled return, which jumped to the label of choice in the calling routine!) Allows you to check off and exit from non-allowed conditions, keep your left margin narrow and the indentations and logic easy to follow.

=== search for returns vs. search for label ===

I probably have analysed just as many code from other programmers and the problem is that you always have to fight lazy programmers. It is just a matter where you currently look.

Imagine a large function - one with a large case statemen which can't be broken down. How will you analze it? From my experience you first look at the beginning, than skipp the middle case and look at the end.

With that top down approch you are likely to see the label first - and then start looking for the fitting gotos.

But even if you analyse bottom up (middle to outside) the goto will at least mean a knudge &quot;Something unstructured is happening here - beware.&quot;

With a goto you have a double chance to see the early exit - with a return only one. The most dangerous goto/return is the one you have not spotted.

Of corse: I usually avoid both - only one in a hundred functions I write has more then one return.

Hi, I removed it as it wasnt a part of the installation. I am sorry if that might seemed harsh, i don't want to scare away contributors, so thanks for contacting me! I have added an article for the global configuration under the miscellaneous chapter, and a new configuration-category. *[[Mambo_Open_Source/Global configuration|A link to the article]]. Please feel free to do more contributions - and i will try to take it to the discussion page before simply deleting stuff.. =) --[[User:August]] 00:01, 28 Jun 2005
: That's OK, no problem. But IMHO: 1) Link to the.. - needs to be somvhere after the INSTALLATION, not at the end or miscelaneous 2) first page could be on more detailed TOC --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 00:28, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Now that we are two users contributing to the book, we should discuss things before doing them. I would e.g. prefer that the category was named &quot;mambo open source&quot; instead of &quot;mos&quot;.

== Description ==

X'Width is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any discrete type. This attribute represents the number of characters it takes to represent the &quot;longest&quot; type value using the [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Image|X'Image]] attribute.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Big, Bigger, Biggest);
 ...
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Image (Biggest) = &quot;BIGGEST&quot; );
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Width = 7); 
 {{Ada/--|Width of &quot;BIGGEST&quot; is seven}}
 {{Ada/--|Width of &quot;BIG&quot; and &quot;BIGGER&quot; are irrelevant.}}

Bias worries

The defintion of gender implies that things like differences in levels of aggression are caused by nurture and not nature ( surely by the percieved projection of masculine or femmine traits things like aggression, extroversion etc are meant) . There's a wealth of evidence that this is false. As someone with Asperger's I can confirm that not all personality differences are due to nurture. ( Asperger's is genetic, has major effects on personality, and only one out of ten cases are in females.)

----

In the gender socialization section, the last sentence 

&quot;Greenberger and Steinberg attribute the differences to gender socialization and differential opportunities for boys and girls.&quot;

is not a sentence
*Actually, it is.  ''Attribute'' is the verb.  Read it this way, &quot;The differences between boys and girls are, according to Greenberger and Steinberg, ''attributed'' to gender socialization and differential opportuniities for boys and girls.&quot;


----

Remember that doctor who tried changing the sex of boy's at birth? They had some condition, I forget the name, which meant that there biological sex was somewhat ambiguous. As they grew, many spontaneously declared that they were boys, despite the fact that they had been socialised as girls? Could we have some reference to that in the article, it's too interesting to ignore. 

----

When you mention Doctor's degrees do you mean PhD's, MD's, or both?
*just PhDs; i'll clarify


----
Should include the two theories for gender differences in the workforce:
Two theories:
*Individual characteristics
**Differences in qualifications (experience, education, skills, etc.)
***Less motivation
***Socialization
*Structural characteristics
**Discrimination
**Non-family friendly policies
Findings are mixed but indicate both can influence the outcome.

== Education ==

I take offense as the passage underneath &quot;Education,&quot; as it is completely subjective, and should either be removed, or reorganized so as to reflect an analytic approach to the distinction, instead of one which seems to be included purely as added backing for the unavoiable feminist perspective of this article, but not out of any scientific obligation.

&quot;Progress in this regard, however, should be tempered by the fact that while women are entering college at higher rates and even earning more degrees, the degrees are in less prestigious areas (e.g., social sciences and humanities compared to physical sciences) and women with degrees still earn less than do men with comparable degrees (Jacobs 1996).&quot;

Defining &quot;prestige&quot; and whether or not the social sciences are in fact somehow more important or useful to society is quite a large task, and is not appropriate as supporting evidence in this article. This is not an acceptable level of neutrality.

* All the author is claiming is that hard science degree's are percieved as more prestigious   * then soft science degree's by the general public, as someone who get's laughed at every time * I say I want to be a philosopher when I go to uni, I can personally confirm this is true!

== Offensive POV ==

It's more than just the ''Education'' section. The whole thing is dripping with the foul idea that homemaking and childrearing is unvaluable, worthless, demeaning, etc. I suspect this originates from very '''male''' sexist values about what occupations are worthwhile and how we should judge things. Must we all rate ourselves by how much money we earn? If so, that's really sad. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:25, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Also when you give examples toward the end of moral panic you use UK examples which are not going to be familiar to the students.  You may want to consider making it more relevant to them.

==Advanced Output Overview ==

In many situations, especially for web programming, you will find that you want to put certain things, such as backslashes or quotes, in your text that aren't allowed in a traditional print statements. A statement such as 

 print &quot;I said &quot;I like mangos and bananas&quot;. &quot;;

will not work because the interpreter would think that the quotes mark the end of the string. As  with all things in Perl, there are many solutions to this problem.

== Use other quotes ==

The quickest solution to this problem would be to use single quotes to surround the string, allowing the use of double quotes in the middle.

 # I said &quot;I like mangos and bananas&quot;.
 print 'I said &quot;I like mangos and bananas&quot;.';

This is obviously not the best solution, as it is conceivable that you are trying to print a string containing both kinds of quote:

 # I said &quot;They're the most delicious fruits&quot;.
 print 'I said &quot;They're the most delicious fruits&quot;.';

== Escape characters ==

For situations like the above where only a short amount of text is being quoted, a common solution is to ''escape'' any quotes in the string. By preceding any quotes with a backslash they are treated as literal characters.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
 print 'I said &quot;They\'re the most delicious fruits&quot;.';
 print &quot;I said \&quot;They\'re the most delicious fruits\&quot;.&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using single quotes, the characters that require escaping are &lt;code&gt;\'&lt;/code&gt;.

Using double quotes, the characters that need escaping are the variable sigils, (i.e. &lt;code&gt;$@%*&lt;/code&gt;) in addition to &lt;code&gt;\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;!-- what else? --&gt;

Using &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; to escape reserved characters of course implies that you also need to escape any backslashes you want to use in your string. To print the second line literally using perl, you would need to write:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
 print &quot; print \&quot;I said \\\&quot;They\\\'re the most delicious fruits\\\&quot;.\&quot;;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Luckily perl provides us with another way of quoting strings that avoids this problem.

== Custom Quotes ==

Perl provides the operators &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qq&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to decide which characters are used to quote strings. Most punctuation characters can be used. Here are a few examples:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
 print qq{ I said &quot;They're the most delicious fruits!&quot;. };
 print q! I said &quot;They're the most delicious fruits\!&quot;. !;
&lt;/source&gt;

The only symbols I have found that cannot be used for these quotes are &lt;code&gt;$ ` /&lt;/code&gt;

== Block Output ==

As can be seen, while the custom quotes option works for short strings, it can run into problems if a lot of text containing a lot of punctuation is output. For this situation, a technique called Block quoting can be used.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
 print &lt;&lt;OUTPUT
  I said &quot;They're the most delicious fruits!&quot;.
 OUTPUT
&lt;/source&gt;

Any string of characters can be used instead of OUTPUT in the example above. Using this technique anything can be output no matter what characters it contains. The one caveat of this method is that the closing OUTPUT must be the first character on the line, there cannot be any space before it.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
 print &lt;&lt;EverythingBetween
  ...
  ...
 EverythingBetween
&lt;/source&gt;

== Variable Output ==

It is possible to output variables within strings when you use some of these methods:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $one = 'mangoes';
 
print &quot;I like $one.&quot;;    # I like mangoes.
print 'I like $one.';    # I like $one.
print qq@ I love $one.@; #  I love mangoes.
print q#I love $one.#;   # I love $one.

print &lt;&lt;OUT
 I love $one
OUT
;                        #  I love mangoes

print &lt;&lt;'OUT'
 I love $one
OUT
;                        #  I love $one
&lt;/source&gt;

Perl will figure out where your variable ends if the character after it is neither a letter, number nor an underscore.  If that is not your case, put your variable inside curly braces:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $one = 'lemon';
 
print &quot;A $one is too sour; &quot;;	# A lemon is too sour;
print &quot;${one}ade is better.\n&quot;;	# lemonade is better.

print &lt;&lt;OUT
 I love ${one}s in $one souffle.
OUT
;                        #  I love lemons in lemon souffle.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Caveats ==
The single quote &lt;code&gt; ' q{ &lt;/code&gt; and double quote &lt;code&gt; &quot; qq &lt;&lt;A &lt;/code&gt; operators, behave differently. Whereas when using double quotes, you can include variables and escape any characters, when you use single quotes you can only escape single quotes and you cannot include variables.

== Here's a link for you ==

I see that you've aded a link to Wellington on your user page. Wikipedia has another good article on [[w:en:Wellington|Wellington]], you can link to it with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:en:Wellington|Wellington]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It also has my cool night panorama of the city from Mount Victoria.

==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 22:40, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

== The School of Philosophy ==

Thank you very much for your contributions to the school of philosophy. I am getting very excited now that I find that more and more people are deciding to contribute.

I find your ''Initial Questions'' course very interesting. I was planning a similar course as an introduction, although I believe it was more oriented toward formal reasoning than your idea is (I say this because you wrote &quot;It is designed to be thought provoking, and relevant&quot;). I was thinking of including different reasoning strategies, including transcendental arguments, genealogies, some notorious fallacies, etc. I haven't written anything of the sort yet because I would like to put some more content into some of the courses that I have already started contributing to. ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 10:24, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC))

Oh, I almost forgot. ''Brilliant'' contribution to the School of Philosophy main page. ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 10:30, 30 Jun 2005 (UTC))

[[Image:Sumac.jpg|right|thumb|Sumac]]

Also '''sumac''', '''soumak''' - Rhus Coriaria, family Anacardiaceae.

This spice comes from the Mediterranean and Middle East, from the berries of a wild bush (although there are many varieties all over the temperate world).  It is an essential ingredient for Arabic cooking, favoured over lemon for sourness and astringency.  It is somewhat related to poison ivy (''Toxicodendron radicans'').

The berries grow in dense clusters of small, russet coloured, rather hairy berries about 10mm (¼ inch) round.  They are dried and crushed into a coarse purple-red powder before use.  Quite aromatic, they are sour, fruity and astringent in flavour.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Admiral Roo. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Admiral Roo~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Johnlavender. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Johnlavender~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MAMBOTOC_SMALL}}

The global configuration is where all major settings with the mambo system is done. This can only be accessed by superadministrators.

==Site==

===Site offline===

When this is active, the whole site will be down, only displaying the DISPLAY LINK TO OFFLINE MESSAGE HERE text and the mambo logo. This is useful when doing heavy maintenance.

===Offline message===

The corresponding message to the [[Mambo_Open_Source/Global_configuration#Site offline|site offline]] setting. You can enter HTML tags here, as long as they do not contain quotes

===System error message=== 

This message is very much like the [[Mambo_Open_Source/Global_configuration#Offline message|offline message]], but differs in function: it will display when a critical error occurs. This could be the database not working, core files are missing etc. Should contain something useful, as admins e-mail address etc.

=== Show UnAuthorized Links=== 

Normally, mambo hides links that a user doesn't have permission to see. An example of this is e.g. links that are only for special users. If this setting is on, the normal users will see the link, but will get an error message when they try to browse to its location. If off, the links will simply be hidden.

=== Allow User Registration=== 

This is very self-explanatory - it enables or disables user registration. If disabled, the &quot;create an account&quot;-link on the login module will be hidden.

=== Use New Account Activation=== 

When active, users will need to activate their account before they can use it. This is done via e-mail, the user gets a e-mail with an activation link. As soon as the user have browsed that link, the account is active. This is to ensure that the user enters a valid e-mail address.

===Require Unique Email===

This will ensure that only one user can be registered per e-mail address. A user will then not be available to register new accounts with the same e-mail address.

===Debug Site===

Turns on and off the error messages of the server. These messages will be loaded in the &quot;debug&quot; module positions. Not very many templates have this position, so this value is a bit &quot;out of date&quot;.

===WYSIWYG Editor===

Chooses the inline editor that will be used in mambo. This applies to every section of mambo where the editor is used.

===List Length===

The default length of lists. This applies to all pages where one can choose this, as in the admin back-end, a content category list and such similar pages.

===Favourites Site Icon===

Place the name of a 16x16 icon file here. This will be used as the sites favourite icon. and is located in the &quot;[mambo-root]/images/stories&quot;-folder.


==Locale==

===Language===

This will change the language in mambo. Note that this does not apply to the content - that is stored in the database. This will only change the phrases controlled in the language file of Mambo. This includes all system messages. Languages are installed in the Language Manager.

===Time Offset===

All hours in Mambo is taken from the servers internal clock. If the server is in a different time zone than what the users of the site are in, edit this to offset the time. Use + and - , together with a number value, to do this.

===Country Locale===

This is the date phrases, such as months and days. They are not in the language file of Mambo, but is installed on the server. You will need to have the correct locale installed on the server, and know its ISO to get the locale you want. The ISO is the value you should enter here.

This subject is so large that it has it's own article. Se [[Mambo Open Source/Country locale|the country locale article]]..

==Content==

It should be mentioned that all of the parameters here can be overwritten for each section. These settings are in the parameters of the sections menu item. Here, all settings are set to &quot;global&quot;, but you can overwrite the settings there. That means that you can have e.g. the back button to show in the global configuration, but edit the parameters of the front page and change it from &quot;global&quot; to &quot;hide&quot;. Then, the back button will be hidden on the front page, no matter what the setting in global configuration is.

===Linked titles===

This setting make the titles linked, and the link is to the full view of the item. This works exactly as the read more button, but will also apply to items that have no text in the main section. See &quot;[[Mambo_Open_Source/Global_configuration#Read More link|read more]]&quot; for details.

===Read More link===

The read more link is a link that will be placed under the intro to an item in a blog section. A good example of what a blog section is, is the front page component. Here you will see a list of articles, whom have been marked as &quot;show on front page&quot;. Then, it is shown on the front page, but only the intro part of the item. All content items in Mambo have two section: intro and main. Only the intro is shown in blog sections. Now, if you write content in the main part of the item, a &quot;read more&quot;-link will be placed underneath it - if the &quot;read more links&quot; setting is set to on. This will take you the full view of the item, with the intro first, then the main section. This is to avoid large texts on the frontpage or any other blog section. 

If you do not want a read more link you can use [[Mambo Open Source/Global configuration#Linked titles|linked titles]].

===Item rating/voting===

This enables a voting system for content items. The users will be able to rate any item from 1 to 5.

===Author Names===

This displays the author name under the title/headline of a content item. The name is the same as the name of the user that created it. Note that it is not the user name that will be displayed, but the users real name, as entered in user registration. This name can be overwritten in the parameters of each content item.

===Created date and time===

Will show a date and time stamp of the creation of the template. The date format will be the same as configured in the language file of Mambo. It will display under the author name, and if author name is off and not displated, it will be under the title/headline.

===Modified Date and Time===

Shows a date and time stamp on when the item. was last edited, in practice the date/time when the item was saved. Will be displayed right underneath the intro text of the item, and underneath the main text if you are in fullview of the item.

===Hits===

This options shows or hides how many times an article has been read since it was first published. This information is always available via the Administration back end when editing the page, but with this option it is viewable by the website visitors.

===PDF icon===

Places a icon to the right of the title/headline of the item that opens a auto-generated pdf file in a popup window. This pdf will contain the title/headline, author name, dates and content just as it appears on the site, but without all modules and other parts of the site. It will not render any images that is in the item though. The PDF option is set to be removed in Mambo 4.5.3.

===Print icon===

Places a icon to the right of the title/headline of the item that opens a auto-generated page in a popup window. This page will contain the title/headline, author name, dates and content just as it appears on the site, but without all modules and other parts of the site. It also contains a print-link in the upper right corner of the popup, that opens the users default print dialog.

===Email icon===

Places a icon to the right of the title/headline of the item that opens a popup with a e-mail to a friend form. This will e-mail a link to the fullview of the content item to the friends address specified.

It does not have to be sent to a friend, you are free to send it to your enemies as well!

===Icons===

This setting applies to the above three icons. If set to on, it will display images that correspond to each icons function. If set to off, a text will be there instead, showing &quot;pdf&quot;, &quot;print&quot; or &quot;e-mail&quot;. These phrases can be edited in mambo's language file.

===Table of Contents on multi-page items===

This will show a table of contents on items that use the multipage mambot. For usage of this mambot, see [[Mambo_Open_Source/Creating multiple pages per content item|the multipage-article]].

===Back button===

This will display a small, texted back button on the bottom of every page created with mambos content generators. It will not show in components etc. The button uses a javascript to go one step back in the users browsers history.

===Content Item Navigation===

Will display &quot;prev&quot; and &quot;next&quot; buttons at the bottom of items that have two or more items in the category it belongs to.

==Database==

'''!warning!''' '''!warning!''' Changing the settings here can make the whole mambo installation unavailable. If so is done, you will need to insert the correct settings directly in the ''configuration.php'' file in mambo's root. '''!warning!''' '''!warning!'''

The values in all these fields depends on how the server is set up, consult the server admin if you don't know the details. 

===Hostname===

This is the hostname of the SQL database. Usually this is localhost.

===MySQL username and password===

These thow fields should contain the username and password used to connect to the database spesified in the [[Mambo_Open_Source/Global_configuration#MySQL Database|MySQL Database]]-field.

===MySQL Database===

The name of the database located on the specified [[Mambo_Open_Source/Global_configuration#Hostname|hostname]].

===MySQL Database Prefix===

The database prefix is added to all the database tables. That means that if the prefix is &quot;mos_&quot; and the table is named &quot;components&quot;, the table will be named &quot;mos_components&quot; in the database. This ensures that there will be no overlapping if the database is used with multiple applications.

For example, you can have two mambo installations on the same server, as long as they don't have the same prefix. See the article &quot;[[Mambo Open Source/Have more than one mambo installation on the same server|have more than one mambo installation on the same server]]&quot; for more details about this.</text>

This page contains a list of reserved words in JavaScript, which cannot be used as names of variables, functions or other objects.

== Reserved words used in JavaScript ==

Current list of keywords used in JavaScript Version 5.1:&lt;ref name=ECMA-262&gt;
[http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/Ecma-262.pdf &quot;ECMA-262 5.1: ECMAScript Language Specification&quot;]

A few other reserved words used in JavaScript represent literal values:&lt;ref name=ECMA-262 /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[JavaScript/Reserved Words/false|false]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[JavaScript/Reserved Words/null|null]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[JavaScript/Reserved Words/true|true]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
|}

== Words reserved for JavaScript in the future ==

Some words have been reserved according to the ECMAScript specification so that they cannot be used as variable names, although currently, they do not have any functionality. These keywords may or may not be reserved words for some ECMAScript specification, and are grouped according to their condition of being reserved.&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Words that are always reserved ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
|}

=== Words that are reserved in strict mode ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;implements&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
|-

| &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt; || 
|}

=== Words that were reserved in ECMAScript standards 1-3 ===

'''Nutella''' is a hazelnut spread made from [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|hazelnuts]], [[Cookbook:cocoa|cocoa]], and [[cookbook:milk|milk]]. It has a chocolaty taste with a hint of roasted hazelnuts. It can be eaten with almost anything and is most commonly eaten with bread, crackers, bagels, and fruit.</text>

I've created the Italian wikiversity , known as wikiversità.

I think that study will become a '''real''' right .
Intellectual growth can not depend from handicaps, income , language.
My idea is to enlarge wikiversity with Wikischool - primary , extending this virtual educational platform to 5-10-y.o. children.
What do you think about this ?

[[Image:WheatGrass.jpg|thumb|right|280px|One week old wheat grass]]

'''Wheat grass juice''' is the extracted juice from young (5 - 10 inch) [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] plants. The juice is touted for many health benefits due to its high concentrations of Chlorophyll, enzymes, vitamins (especially B's) and minerals. Another benefit of drinking wheat grass juice is a significant energy ''buzz'', due to the very high concentrations of B vitamins, that lasts several hours.  

A typical portion is two fluid ounces, requiring the juicing of 1/3 to 1 square foot of wheat grass. The juice has a pungent, sweet odor/taste which is an acquired taste. It may be drunk straight, or mixed with other juices, such as carrot or apple.

Wheatgrass juice should always be consumed immediately after juicing.

==Materials==
* 1 - 2 cups Wheat berries
* 1 Tray (cafeteria type, to grow shoots on)
* 2 cups potting soil
* Large jar

[[Image:WheatGrassJuicing.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Wheat grass juice from a manual juicer.]]

==Growing==
* Soak the wheat berries overnight
* Drain, cover with damp paper towel allow a day or so to sprout (still in the large jar)
* Spread the potting soil on the tray, and then the sprouts.
* Keep watered.
* The sprouts should be ready for use in about a week

==Juicing==
*Use an electric or manual juicer
*Drink two to four ounces straight, or mixed with the juice of your choice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MMM devHeader}}

So, you want to create a low budget film, therefore the script has to follow certain guidelines. Some of these guidelines are:

* The script must have a distinct three-act structure, or a beginning, middle, and end. The three acts are, respectively: setup, conflict, and resolution.

* Get all the background story, ground laying and introductions done in the first act. The first act should not exceed 40 minutes in length.

*The film must have a dynamic lead character. A dynamic character is one with heavy amounts of characterization (backstory), and one who develops and changes throughout the story relative to their quest and the film's subject matter. Also, the character must have a goal of some sort, and have some sort of motivation that would make them want to achieve their goal. 

*Life is not black-and-white; everything is in shades of gray. To create fully realized characters, have an aspect of the good guy that is bad, and have an aspect of the bad guy that is good. 

* Bring the story to a close. Do not leave loose ends, or big things for people to ponder on, tie it up with a bow.

* 100-110 pages maximum. If you write a lot of non-action descriptions in your script you can write a few more pages. The end movie will come to about 90-100 minutes.

Now a few producer notes about the distributors notes:

* If the character has to swear, then make her swear: you cannot replace the right word with any other word. But keep in mind that any swearing you write, the producer will need an alternative that will shoot at the same time, so distributors can have a &quot;cute&quot; version for tv.

* Good writers hate plastic characters so even if they say keep the good guy good and the bad guy bad, you should still write characters with depth. Make the characters real instead of plastic, unless you are shooting plastic dolls and/or action figures.

* Have free reign with special effects, producers can adapt them or replace them later.

* Action does not mean a sacrifice of character.

And finally a few pointers to help us keep the budget down:
*   Keep locations to a minimum.
*   Keep the number of characters to a minimum.
*   Write for day time where possible.
*   Write in sequences that can shoot on digital (security video cameras etc).
*   Stay away from expensive specialised props and sets.
*   Keep driving scenes to a minimum.

That about covers it. Keep these notes at the back of your mind as you write. If you find yourself faced with something that &quot;feels right&quot; but you think might make the script too expensive or breaks one of these guides: write it. You can discuss it with the producer later. Remember everyone still wants the best script possible.

== Maximizing Resources ==
You don't want to spend all of your money on actors, and you don't want to spend it all on the quality of your film.  The key is finding a balance between these two.  It might be wise to lean on the side of spending money on things that will improve the quality of your content if your focus is a character-based story.  On the other hand, if your focus is mainly visual you might want to lean towards higher quality equipment.

== To Script, Or Not To Script ==
Depending on the type of film you are making, you may not want to write at all.  Sometimes the best scenes result from raw footage that you shoot when there is no script.  This can be especially true if you are writing with a low budget.  The aspect of your film that will distinguish it from higher budget films is your ability to capture events that are not scripted.  

In terms of scripting for scene changes, special effects, or other events, sometimes during editing you will find that no matter how you scripted the event, you are limited by your raw footage in some way.  This may lead to changes in where you decide to place the event.

==Low Budget Action==

We want to create a low budget action film, I believe that means we have to write a low budget action script, therefore the script has to follow certain guidelines. Some of these come from the distribution companies, and others come from personal experience. Remember that I mean them as guides and not as rules:

* Start with a hang-jaw, kick-in-the-ass, adrenalin-pumped, blow-it-up, speed-boosted, high-octane, take-breath-away, holly-cow-how-did-they-think-of-that action sequence.

* Get all the background story, ground laying and introductions done in the first 20 pages.

* Keep the story moving forward, no unnecessary tangents or parallel stories

* Keep the hero a hero.

* Likewise, keep the bad guy a bad guy.

* No overt, unnecessary amounts of blood. In fact, no moving blood at all, that means no blood splattering on walls, or flying out of people's chest or flowing uncontrollably from someone's chest. Once again, think cartoon. Moving blood raises the rating and the lower the rating, the more we sell.

* I hate plastic characters so even if they say keep the good guy good and the bad guy bad, you should still write with depth. make the characters real instead of plastic.

* Have free reign with special effects producers can adapt them or replace them later.

* Action does not mean a sacrifice of character.

That about covers it. I do not want all this to scare you, but you need to have it at the back of your mind as you write. If you find yourself faced with something that &quot;feels right&quot; but you think might make the script too expensive or breaks one of these guides: write it. You can discuss it with the producer discuss later. Remember everyone still wants the best script possible.

==Mambelfish reported problems==
[http://mamboforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=8547&amp;forum_id=8 source]

*The language switcher appears when you add &lt;?php mosLoadComponent( 'mambelfish' );?&gt;
at the place where you wish in your template. 

*You can also just use the module (if you have installed it) and place it at any module position that you like (and that you have published) - but as far as I know the module just uses the Component ;-) 

*about the languages, that don't change... have you checked the URL? at the end there should be the parameter '''lang=XX''' ... if you see only 'lang=' and nothing more you just have to type an identification code of the languages in your mambelfish configuration [components-mambelfish-language configuration]

*Have you checked your language configuration in the Mambo Backend?
(Components &gt; Mambelfish &gt; Language Configuration)

*'''problem description:'''By: Toni Dellum '''[http://mamboforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=9587&amp;forum_id=8 Mambelfish won't translate]''' 2005-06-03 22:19  
I have installed Mambelfish 1.5 in Mambo 4.5.2.1.
Also installed the mamblefish module and the frontend mambot.
Installed French and Portuguese languages via Admin -&gt; Site Languages.
Activiated the languages -Components -&gt; mambelfish -&gt;language configurations; then set the iso for each language (en, fr, pt).
To translate, went to Components -&gt; Mambelfish -&gt;Translate
Then selected a language and the menu clicked on a menu item to translate it. No translation occured.
There are 2 icons beside the textfield; the first when clicked simply copies the English menu to the translation field.
The other icon deletes.
Everything seems to have gone well, EXCEPT the translation.&lt;BR&gt;

Hi,I have same problem. I think '''it's php-version''' since Mablefish worked ok when I had php version 4.3.11 after updating to 4.4 series mamblefish didn't work anymore and I had those two images on the traslate page also.  
2005-07-05 11:22  
Yes it did work! Now I have '''Mambo 4.5.2 with Mambelfish 1.5 component runnig on php 4.3.11''' and it works ok. I dont know what was the problem but I try to figure it out and write a patch against it.

==Discussion Forums: open-discussion==
http://mamboforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=10104&amp;forum_id=7

I have a complete new mambo version 4.5.2.3 installed. I started in the backend to install mambelfish.

- Mambelfish_1.5.zip with the component installer
- Mbf_module.zip with the module installer
- Mbf_searchbot.zip with the mambot installer

The installation of the components, modules and mambot files went successful. Then I patched the component using the corepatch 4.5.2 from the mamboforge. This step I didn't before. But it doesn't matter wheather patched or not patched the load of the language files using
Site -&gt;Languages_Install function doesn't work.

This function requests again a “Upload Package File” and alternatively in the line below a “Install from directory” facility referring as default to my local directory: C:\Apache2\Apache2\htdocs\mambo\administrator\components\com_installer\language. None of the upload packages did work as well as the installation from the C:\Apache2\Apache2htdocs\mambo\administrator\components\com_installer\language directory.

What is the name of the requested file, which I have to choose and where I can find it. I followed exactly the procedures of the readme although it is not mentioned that the modules and the mambot have to be installed as well.

Again it is a complete new mambo installation as provided from the mamboforge server with the default template and the sample data.

Please tell me the name of the file to be keyed in in order to get the language files loaded.

'''Processed cheese''' or '''American Cheese''' is a food product made with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and [[Cookbook:Water|water]]), and usually other flavoring and coloring agents.  It has a taste and appearance similar to cheese, but a different [[Cookbook:Aesthetics|texture]] and very different melting properties.

It is generally made from the scraps (trimmings, spoilage, etc.) of a variety cheeses, but colored yellow and marketed to compete with mild [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar]].

== C strings ==

[quote]There is one more kind of literal that needs to be explained in connection with chars: the string literal. A string is a series of characters, usually intended to be output to the string. They are surrounded by double quotes (&quot; &quot;, not ' '). An example of a string literal is the &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot; in the &quot;Hello, World&quot; example.[/quote]

How can one assign string to another string? Will this work and why?

 char str[20];
 str = &quot;mystring&quot;;

== Answer ==

No this won't work. C is a low level language and you need to ''copy'' the data from one string to the next:

 char str[20];
 strncpy (str, &quot;mystring&quot;, 19);
 str [19] = '\0';

Supprised about the 3rd line? The bitter truth is that none of the predefined string operations in &quot;string.h&quot; could be considerd ''safe''.

; strcpy, strcat : will copy a larger string into a smaller overwriting memory that follows.
; strncpy : won't add a '\0' to the end of the string when the source string is longer then the max. lenght specfied.
; strncat : For once strncat counts the characters read from the source string - which is not as usefull then counting the characters used up in the destination string. And then - just to supprise you and unlike strncpy - will copy n + 1 characters allways adding a '\0'.
; strlen : will run forever if the '\0' is missing for whatever reason - with strncpy beeing one possible reason.

An realy experienced C programmer - like myself - writes his/her own string operations with propper support for a maximum length on the destination string.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:13, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:However, you can initialize an array of characters with a literal string, like &lt;tt&gt;char my_string[20] = &quot;za warudo!&quot;;&lt;/tt&gt;. This won't work with anything except things that are literals after preprocessing, as you all should know, and hardly merits a mention in the module proper. (Perhaps in a section on advanced syntax, or something? If this is actually advanced in any way.) (and please don't advocate reinventing the C library. that's something that students do. experienced programmers roll with whatever is available instead of fighting the tide.)

== Mention 64 bit pc's ==

There is mentionned that most modern pc's are 32 bit. But shouldn't there be mentionned that the most modern pc's are now 64 bit?--[[User:Sanderd17|Sanderd17]] ([[User talk:Sanderd17|talk]]) 20:24, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

== C level one doubt ==

main()
{
int a=5,b=2;
printf(&quot;%d&quot;, a+++b);
}

what will be the output?? {{unsigned|115.241.34.90}}

:You could just try it.  It outputs 7.  I guess the question is whether &lt;code&gt;a+++b&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;a++ +b&lt;/code&gt; (it is), or as &lt;code&gt;a+ ++b&lt;/code&gt;.  This sort of question never occurs to me because I make effective use of whitespace when I write code.  Ambiguous code is hard to maintain, and is therefore bad code. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 15:36, 22 September 2011 (UTC)

== Contents/In this section ==

At the end of the page there is a section about '''Contents''' and '''In this section'''
These do not appear correct as they mention arrays, which are not discussed there.

Ni hao! You introduce the several different ways characters were created, saying 
:&quot;... six different origins. They are 象形,指事,會意,形聲,轉注and假借.&quot;
Would it be possible to give each of these ways a short English explanation/name?  Perhaps you could do this at the beginning of each section below there, like &quot;象形 - picture characters&quot;, &quot;形聲 - sound plus hint&quot;, etc. ?


Perhaps where you say &quot;So, you can see, their pronunciations are similar&quot; you could also say that &quot;presumably the pronunciations were even more similar, perhaps the same, in ancient Chinese&quot; ?

==Anatomy==
*Superior edge - plane of superior surface of the soft palate
*Inferior edge - superior surface of hyoid bone / floor of the valecula
*Includes base of tongue, inferior (anterior) surface of the soft palate, uvula, anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars, glossotonsillar sulci, pharyngeal tonsils, and lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls

==Risk Factors==
*Smoking
*Alcohol
*EGFR amplification
*HPV 16
*chronic irritation

===HPV infection as a risk factor===

*'''RTOG 0129; 2010''' PMID 20530316 -- &quot;Human Papilloma Virus and Survival of Patients with Oropharyngeal Cancer.&quot;  Ang KK, N Engl J Med. 2010; 363, 24-35
**Post-hoc analysis.  Randomized trial of standard fractionation vs accelerated fractionation and concurrent cisplatin. 317 of 433 patients with oropharyngeal CA, who had HPV status. HPV positive 83%. Median F/U 4.4 years
**Outcome: 
**Risk Stratification:  
**Conclusion:  HPV status strongly associated with survival.  Smoking increases risk of death, even in HPV+ population.  Risk stratification possible (High/Intermediate/Low)

*'''RTOG 0129; 2009''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=65&amp;abstractID=31969 ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;Survival outcomes by tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) status in stage III-IV oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) in RTOG 0129.&quot; (Gillison ML, J Clin Oncol 27:15s, 2009 (suppl; abstr 6003))
**Post-hoc analysis. Randomized trial of standard fractionation vs accelerated fractionation and concurrent cisplatin. 317 of 433 patients with oropharyngeal CA, who had HPV status. HPV positive 83%. Median F/U 4.4 years
**Outcome: 2-year OS HPV+ 87% vs. HPV- 67% (HR 0.54, SS); PFS 72% vs. 51% (SS). Hazard rate for death if HPV-/tobacco+ 4.3 vs. HPV-/tobacco- 2.4 vs HPV+/tobacco+ 1.8 vs HPV+/tobacco- 1.0
**Conclusion: HPV status strongly associated with survival

*'''Johns Hopkins, 2007''' PMID 17494927 -- &quot;Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer.&quot;  D'Souza G et al.  N Engl J Med. 2007; 356(19):1944-56
**Case control study of 100 pts w/ newly diagnosed oropharyngeal CA and 200 control pts.
**Oropharyngeal CA significantly associated w/ HPV type 16 and high lifetime number of oral sex partners (&gt;6) and high lifetime number of vaginal sex partners (&gt;26).  
**Smoking/alcohol w/ increased association with oropharyngeal CA among subjects w/o HPV-16 exposure.

===HPV and EGFR Interaction===
*'''Sydney Cancer Centre; 2010''' (1987-2006) PMID 20537890 -- &quot;Relationships between epidermal growth factor receptor expression and human papillomavirus status as markers of prognosis in oropharyngeal cancer.&quot; (Hong A, Eur J Cancer. 2010 May 25. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 270 oropharynx SCC reviewed, HPV E6 by PCR and increased p16 by IHC, EGFR by IHC. HPV+ 37%; EGFR+ 87%. Significant inverse relationship between HPV and EGFR (if HPV- then EGFR+ 93%, if HPV+ then EGFR+ 78% (SS)). Median F/U 2.5 years
**Outcome: Adjusted hazard rate for LRF and OS 0.3 if HPV+ compared with HPV-. Adjusted hazard rate for LRF 5.1 and OS 2.5 if EGFR+ compared with EGFR-. If both HPV- and EGFR+, adjusted HR 13x risk for LRF and 4x risk for OS compared with HPV+/EGFR-
**Conclusion: HPV and EGFR are independent prognostic markers; combination of HPV- and EGFR+ significantly worse prognosis

==Risk of LN Involvement==
*'''Johns Hopkins; 2009''' (1998-2007) PMID 19131181 -- &quot;Defining the risk of involvement for each neck nodal level in patients with early T-stage node-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma.&quot; (Sanguineti G, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Aug 1;74(5):1356-64. Epub 2009 Jan 7.)
**Retrospective. 103 patients with T1-T2 clinically N+ oropharyngeal CA, who underwent neck dissection (radical LND 15%, modified radical LND 71%, selective LND 14%). 
**Outcome: Positive Level IB 9%, Level II 91%, Level III 41%, Level IV 18%, and Level V 3%. If CT (-), then positive Level IB 3%, Level II 76%, Level III 17%, Level IV 6%, and Level V 1%. Can contour Level IB only posterior half
**Conclusion: Levels II and III should be included in high risk volumes regardless of imaging, Level IV should be low risk; Levels IB and V at very low risk and could be excluded from RT

==Early Stage==
*'''RTOG 00-22''' (2001-2005) [http://www.rtog.org/members/protocols/h0022/h0022.pdf Protocol (PDF)]  
**Prospective. 69 patients. Stage I-III (T1-2 N0-1) oropharynx (tonsil, base of tongue, or palate). Neck staging is based on palpation, not CT, but patients who are &quot;upstaged&quot; by CT are eligible. RT 66 Gy / 30 fractions (2.2 Gy/fx) to primary target PTV and 54-60 Gy / 30 fractions (1.8-2.0 Gy/fx) to secondary target PTV. No chemotherapy. Objectives: 1) assess feasibility of target coverage and parotid sparing. 2) Determine patterns of failure. 3) Acute and late effects. Median F/U 2.8 years. 
**'''2009''' PMID 19540060 -- &quot;Multi-Institutional Trial of Accelerated Hypofractionated Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Early-Stage Oropharyngeal Cancer (RTOG 00-22).&quot; (Eisbruch A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Apr;76(5):1333-8. Epub on 2009 Jun 17.)
***Outcome: 2-year LRF 9% (if major deviations 50%, else 6%, SS)
***Toxicity: Grade 2+ skin 12%, mucosa 24%, salivary 67%, esophagus 19%, ORN 6%. Xerostomia 6 months 55%, 1 years 25%, 2 years 16%; salivary output didn't recover over time
***Conclusion: Moderately AHFX IMRT alone feasible

==Pre-op RT vs. Post-op RT==
*'''RTOG 73-03''' (1973-1979)
**Randomized. 320 patients. Operable stage T2-T4 any N (but not fixed); oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, or maxillary sinus. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 50 Gy vs. Arm 2) Post-op RT 60 Gy. In addition, OC and OP lesions may be randomized Arm 3) definitive RT 65-70 Gy, with surgery reserved for salvage (n=43). 
**'''10-years; 1999''' PMID 1993628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized study of preoperative versus postoperative radiation therapy in advanced head and neck carcinoma: long-term follow-up of RTOG study 73-03.&quot; (Tupchong L et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Jan;20(1):21-8.)
***Only pre-op vs. post-op subset (n=277). Oral cavity (14%), &lt;u&gt;oropharynx (17%)&lt;/u&gt;, hypopharynx (43%), supraglottic larynx (26%) 
***Outcome: LRC pre-op 58% vs. post-op 70% (SS), &lt;2 years no difference (failures 59% vs. 58%), but marked &gt;2 years (failures 27% vs 8%); OS no difference due to late (&gt;2 years) deaths from DM and from second primaries
***Supraglottic larynx: LRC pre-op 53% vs. post-op 77% (SS); 78% failures &lt;2 years
***Toxicity: no difference
***Conclusion: Post-op RT better for LRC (especially in SGL), but no impact on OS due to distant failure and second primaries
**Comment: some argument for definitive chemoRT instead of surgery and post-op RT since after 2 yrs, distant mets are primary cause of failure resulting in similar 10 OS in this trial. LRC still better for post-op vs definitive RT alone. Also, different doses used, at the time believed equivalent given the setting


==Surgery + RT vs. Chemo-RT==
*'''Singapore''' (1996-2000) 
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to slow accrual.'' 199 patients, resectable Stage III/IV SCHNC excluding NPC and salivary glands (larynx 32% (supraglottis 23%), oral cavity 27%, &lt;u&gt;oropharynx 21%&lt;/u&gt;, hypopharynx 12%). T4 56%. Arm 1) surgery + adjuvant RT 60/30 vs. Arm 2) RT 66/33 + concurrent cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2/d both given as continuous IV over 96 hours x2 cycles. 90% received at least 1 cycle of chemo 
**'''2005''' PMID 16012523 -- &quot;Surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III/IV nonmetastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer: a randomised comparison.&quot; (Soo KC, Br J Cancer. 2005 Aug 8;93(3):279-86.) Median F/U 6 years 
***Outcome: 3-year DFS: S+RT 50% vs. chemo-RT 40% (NS). Organ preservation (larynx/hypopharynx 68%, &lt;u&gt;oropharynx 55%&lt;/u&gt;, oral cavity 21%). Chemo-RT group had poor surgical salvage of 47%, with no long-term survivors (possibly due to larger proportion of T4 and oral cavity cancers) 
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT not superior to surgery+RT, but can be attempted for organ preservation in larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx; organ preservation in oral cavity poor

==Induction Chemo-RT vs. Primary RT alone==
*'''RTOG 68-01''' -- methotrexate
**Randomized. 638 patients, Stage III-IV oral cavity (23%), &lt;u&gt;oropharynx (55%)&lt;/u&gt;, supraglottic larynx (12%), hypopharynx (10%). Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) IV MTX 25 mg q3d x5 followed by RT. RT 55-80 Gy
**'''1980''' PMID 7410127 -- &quot;Adjuvant intravenous methotrexate or definitive radiotherapy alone for advanced squamous cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx or hypopharynx.&quot; (Fazekas JT, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1980 May;6(5):533-41.)
***Outcome: median OS RT vs. MTX-RT: oral cavity 11.8 mo vs. 12.4 mo, &lt;u&gt;oropharynx 13.6 mo vs. 13.1 mo&lt;/u&gt;, SGL 17.2 mo vs. 19.2 mo, hypopharynx 9.7 mo vs. 13.4 mo
***Conclusion: Minimal gain, induction methotrexate should not be used

==Altered Fractionation==
*'''RTOG 90-03''' (1991-1997) -- SF vs HF vs Split course AFX vs AFX-CB
**Randomized, 4 arms. 1073 patients. Stage III-IV (oral cavity, oropharynx, or supraglottic larynx) or Stage II-IV (base of tongue, hypopharynx). Arm 1) SF standard fractionation 70/35 @ 2 Gy/fx vs. Arm 2) HF hyperfractionated 81.6/68 @ 1.2 Gy BID vs. Arm 3) AFX-S split course accelerated fractionation 67.2/42 @ 1.6 Gy BID with 2 week break after 38.4 Gy vs. Arm 4) AFX-CB concomitant boost 72 Gy given 54/30 @ 1.8 Gy + 18/12 @ 1.5 Gy concurrent BID boost
**'''2-years; 2000''' PMID 10924966 -- &quot;A Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) phase III randomized study to compare hyperfractionation and two variants of accelerated fractionation to standard fractionation radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: first report of RTOG 9003.&quot; (Fu KK, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Aug 1;48(1):7-16.). Median F/U 2 years, 3.4 for alive patients
***Outcome: 2-year LRC SF 46% vs. HF 54% (SS) vs. AFX-S 47% (NS) vs. AFX-CB 54% (SS); DFS 32% vs. 38% (NS) vs. 33% (NS) vs. 39% (NS); OS 46% vs. 54% (NS) vs. 46% (NS) vs. 51% (NS)
***Sites of failure: LF 44% vs. 38% vs. 43% vs. 37%; RF 32% vs. 27% vs. 31% vs. 33%
***Toxicity: Increased acute effects but no increase in late effects
***Conclusion: HF or CB improve LRC compared to SF, no impact on DFS and OS. Split course comparable to SF

*'''RTOG 71-01''' (1971-1976) -- continuous vs. split-course
**'''1993''' PMID 8213620 -- &quot;&quot;Compensated&quot; split-course versus continuous radiation therapy of carcinoma of the tonsillar fossa. Final results of a prospective randomized clinical trial of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group.&quot; (Marcial VA, Am J Clin Oncol. 1993 Oct;16(5):389-96.)
***Randomized. 137 patients. All stages, no adenoCA. Arm 1) split course RT 30/10 + 30/10 vs. Arm 2) continuous RT 60/30-66/33
***Outcome: 5-year LRC split course 25% vs. continuous 28% (NS); 5-year OS 19% vs. 29% (NS)
***Late toxicity: split course 17% vs. continuous 24% (NS)
***Conclusion: No difference

*'''EORTC 22791'''
**See [[Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/General#Hyperfractionation|Radiation Oncology:H&amp;N]]
**Improved LC for T3 but not T2 tumors. Trend to improved OS.

==Base of Tongue==
*Clinical presentation
**Mild sore throat
**Many clinically silent locally, and present with neck mass
**With further enlargement, difficulty swallowing, nasal or &quot;hot potato&quot; voice quality, and ear pain
*Spread
**BOT proper: tend to stay confined to tongue for long time. Advanced lesions spread toward larynx, oral tongue, and parapharyngeal space
**Valecula: spread along mucosal surface to epiglottis and lateral pharyngeal wall. Can penetrate hyoepiglottic ligament into pre-epiglottic space
**Lateral BOT: spread into glossotonsillar sulcus, and then into neck
*LN drainage
**LN+ in 50-80%
**Bilateral LN+ in 35-55%
**If clinical ipsilateral N0, pN+ 20-30%
*Treatment overview
**Surgery and RT produce comparable outcomes; however, BOT excision generally causes greater disability
**Surgical approaches
***Small volume T1-T2 can consider transoral laser excision with neck dissection
***Approaches through the mandible can be via midline split or via horizontal split
***Suprahyoid, transhyoid, and infrahyoid approaches can also be used
***Removal of large tumors may require laryngectomy
**If N0, consider treating bilateral neck to Levels II-IV. If N+, consider treating bilateral neck to Levels I-V
*Outcome: local control for RT varies with stage, from &gt;95% for T1 to ~50% for T4 (see PMID 16462500)


===Definitive RT===
*'''University of Florida; 2006''' (1964-2003) PMID 16462500 -- &quot;Definitive radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the base of tongue.&quot; (Mendenhall WM, Am J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb;29(1):32-9.)
**Retrospective. 333 patients with BOT, treated with definitive RT. Daily (25%, median dose 70 Gy) or twice daily (75%, median dose 76.8 Gy or concomitant boost 72 Gy) fractionation. IMRT for last 3 year in N0 or ipsilateral N+. Adjuvant chemo (more recently) in 18%. Median F/U 6.6 years
**Outcome: 5-year LC T1 98%, T2 92%, T3 82%, T4 53%. 5-year LRC Stage I-II 100%, III 82%, IVa 87%, IVb 58%. 5-year CSS by Stage 91%, 77%, 84%, 45%. 5-year OS by Stage 67%, 66%, 67%, 33%
**Toxicity: Severe complications 16%
**Conclusion: LRC and survival after RT comparable to surgery; morbidity less

===Concurrent Chemotherapy===
*'''MD Anderson; 2004''' - PMID 15022283 (1975-98) &amp;mdash; &quot;Is concurrent chemoradiation the treatment of choice for all patients with Stage III or IV head and neck carcinoma?&quot; Garden AS et al.  Cancer. 2004 Mar 15;100(6):1171-8.
**Retrospective. 299 pts with small tumors (T1-T2) of oropharynx that are Stage III-IV based on N-stage. Treated with RT alone.
**Median f/u 82 mo. 5-yr LRF, DM, OS were 15%, 19%, and 64%. LRC was 95% for T1 vs 79% for T2. 
**Conclusion: Excellent local control for small T-stage tumors of the oropharynx. Chemoradiotherapy would not significantly benefit these pts.

===Interstitial Brachytherapy===
*'''Mass General Hospital, 2005''' - PMID 15726587 (1983-00) -- &quot;Definitive radiotherapy with interstitial implant boost for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base.&quot;  Karakoyun-Celik O et al.  Head Neck. 2005 May;27(5):353-61.
**40 pts w/ primary or recurrent SCC of BOT who received interstitial brachy as part of initial management.  54% had T3/T4 dz.
**Oropharynx, b/l necks, SC comprehensively irradiated w/ BOT receiving median of 61 Gy via EBRT.  Median implant dose 17.4 Gy (adjusted to reach dose to tumor of 80 Gy).
**5 yr OS 62%, 10 yr OS 27%.
**Local control 78% at 5 yrs, 70% at 10 yrs.  78% organ preservation rate.
**2 pts w/ grade 3 osteonecrosis (5%)

*'''William Beaumont, 1996''' - PMID 8780531 (1986-1995) -- &quot;Excellent functional outcome in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the base of tongue treated with external irradiation and interstitial iodine 125 boost.&quot;  Horwitz EM et al.  Cancer. 1996 Sep 1;78(5):948-57.
**20 pts w/ carcinoma of BOT w/ I-125 seed brachytherapy as component of tx.
**Pts received 50-66.6 Gy via EBRT followed by interstitial implant 2-3 wks later.  Median implant dose of 27 Gy.  Implant volume included tumor, glossotonsillar sulcus, and pharyngeal wall/tonsil in select cases.
**5 yr actuarial local control rate of 88%.  After salvage, overall 5 yr actuarial local control was 93%
**Speech and swallow preserved in 18/20 patients.

*'''Gainesville, 1990''' - PMID 2370179 (1964-1986) -- &quot;Is interstitial implantation essential for successful radiotherapeutic treatment of base of tongue carcinoma?&quot;  Foote RL et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990 Jun;18(6):1293-8. 
**84 pts w/ SCC of BOT tx'd w/o interstitial implantation. (qD in 59 pts, BID in 25 pts)
**Local control rate for T2 (88%), T3 (77%), T4 (36%).  Improved local control seen for T4 pts if BID fractionation.
**Incidence of bone exposure 6%, soft tissue necrosis 19%

===Management of Neck===
*'''MSKCC, 1997''' - PMID 9276364 (1981-1996) -- &quot;Long-term regional control after radiation therapy and neck dissection for base of tongue carcinoma.&quot;  Lee HJ et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Jul 15;38(5):995-1000.
**68 pts w/ SCC of BOT tx'd w/ primary RT.
**54 Gy to tumor via EBRT + 20-30 Gy interstitial implant.  50 Gy to neck (boosted to 60 Gy for if clinically positive.  Neck dissection done if clinically palpable neck nodes (even if complete response to RT)
**Actuarial 5 yr neck control 95%, 10 yr neck control 86%
**No cases of grade 3 fibrosis.
**Neck dissection suggested at time of implant for BOT SCC.

==Tonsil==
*RT alone: &gt;80% LC for stages I-III; surgery can be reserved for salvage
*Concurrent chemotherapy used for advanced stage; planned neck dissection can be considered for bulky disease. Conversely, primary surgery with adjuvant RT may be used
*Contralateral neck treatment: Overall failure rate &lt;5% in select patients (mostly T1-2N0-1; see below). Consider contralateral RT for CTV crossing midline, infiltration of base of tongue or glossopalatine sulcus, or N2c/N3 disease (Perez 5th)

===Primary Outcomes===
*'''University of Florida''' 
**'''2006''' (1964-2003) PMID 16755183 -- &quot;Definitive radiotherapy for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.&quot; (Mendenhall WM, Am J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jun;29(3):290-7.)
***Retrospective. 503 patients; 198 planned neck dissection, 57 chemo. Minimum 2-year F/U
***5-year outcome: LC: T1 88%, T2 84%, T3 78%, T4 61%. Neck control: N0 95%, N1 93%, N2a 89%, N2b 84%, N2c 77%, N3 66%. LRC: Stage I 92%, II 88%, III 88%, IVA 84%, IVB 66%. High failure rates for anterior pillar lesions compared with fossa/posterior pillar
***Contralateral neck: 2/58 (3%) patients treated with ipsilateral primary &amp; neck RT developed recurrence in contralateral neck
***Severe late toxicity: 9%
***Conclusion: Definitive RT provides comparable cure rates as surgery, with lower complications
**'''2000''' PMID 10829041, 2000 (1964-1997) &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsillar region: a preferred alternative to surgery?&quot; Mendenhall WM et al.  J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jun;18(11):2219-25.
***Retrospective. 400 pts. with T1-T4, N0-N3, tonsil cancers. Treated with radiation therapy alone. Minimum 2 year follow-up. 
***Outcome: 5-yr LC by stage: T1, 83%; T2, 81%; T3, 74%; and T4, 60%.
***Recurrence: 83 patients had LR, 36 underwent a salvage procedure, and 17 pts were successfully salvaged. (About 1/2 of LR can be successfully salvaged)
***Toxicity: No patients had severe acute complications from RT.
***Conclusion: Local-regional control similar after surgery or RT for tonsillar cancer, with the risks of a severe or fatal complication higher for those patients treated surgically.


===Contralateral Neck===
*'''Colorado; 2009''' PMID 19168295 --&quot;Freedom from local and regional failure of contralateral neck with ipsilateral neck radiotherapy for node-positive tonsil cancer: results of a prospective management approach.&quot; (Rusthoven KE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Aug 1;74(5):1365-70.)
**Retrospective. 20 patients with well lateralized, ipsilateral node positive tonsil cancer.  Lesions not involving midline structures (BOT, soft palate or glossotonsillar sulcus)
**80% stage IV; N1 20%; N2a 15%; N2b 65%
**No contralateral failures observed at median FU of 19 months
**Conclusion: Ipsilateral-only RT may be reasonable in well selected patients with ipsilateral node-positive tonsil cancer.  More patients and longer follow-up are required to validate these results

*'''University of Florida; 2006''' (1964-2003) PMID 16755183 -- &quot;Definitive radiotherapy for tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.&quot; (Mendenhall WM, Am J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jun;29(3):290-7.)
**''See full study above.'' Retrospective, 503 patients 
**Contralateral neck: 2/58 (3%) patients treated with ipsilateral primary &amp; neck RT developed recurrence in contralateral neck
**Conclusion: Ipsilateral fields can be used for patients with well-lateralized tumors

*'''Erasmus Medical Center; 2004''' (1986-2001) PMID 15183475 -- &quot;Brachytherapy versus surgery in carcinoma of tonsillar fossa and/or soft palate: late adverse sequelae and performance status: can we be more selective and obtain better tissue sparing?&quot; (Levendag P, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 1;59(3):713-24.)
**Retrospective. 190 patients with T1-3N0-3. ''For full details, please see PMID abstract''
**Contralateral neck: 0/29 patients T1-3N0 disease and no contralateral treatment had recurrence. 6/149 (4%) patients T1-3 ipsilateral N0/+ contralateral N0, with electively treated contralateral necks developed recurrence. Substantial relapse (&gt;10%) if base of tongue infiltration
**Conclusion: One can be more selective in treating contralateral neck; don't need to treat unless the tumor extends beyond the midline of the soft palate (uvula) or beyond the lateral one-third of the ipsilateral base of the tongue.

*'''Princess Margaret; 2001''' (1970-91) - PMID 11567806 &amp;mdash; &quot;The benefits and pitfalls of ipsilateral radiotherapy in carcinoma of the tonsillar region.&quot; O'Sullivan B et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Oct 1;51(2):332-43.
**Retrospective. 228 pts were treated with ipsilateral nodal irradiation. 84% had T1-2, 58% N0 tumors. Median F/U 5.7 years
**Contralateral failure: Crude rate 3.5%. T1 0%, T2 1.5%, T3 10%, T4 0%. N0 0%, N1 9%, N2/3 0%. All T1 or N0 patients had no contralateral failures. Significant risk (&gt;10%) if involving medial one third of palate, base of tongue
**Conclusion: Selected cases of tonsilar carcinoma show low risk of contralateral neck failure with ipsilateral technique.

*'''Hokkaido; 2000''' (1989-1996) PMID 10699473 -- &quot;Ipsilateral irradiation for carcinomas of tonsillar region and soft palate based on computed tomographic simulation.&quot; (Kagei K, Radiother Oncol. 2000 Feb;54(2):117-21.)
**Retrospective. 32 patients, tonsil/soft palate. Tumor didn't cross midline, no contralateral LNs. Ipsilateral technique 65/26 +/- 5-15 Gy boost. Median F/U 3.7 years
**Contralateral failure: 0%
**Conclusion: Ipsilateral technique for tumors that don't cross midline and have no contralateral LNs

*'''British Columbia; 1999''' (1975-1993) PMID 10435802 -- &quot;Cancer of the tonsil: the results of ipsilateral radiation treatment.&quot; (Jackson SM, Radiother Oncol. 1999 May;51(2):123-8.)
**Retrospective. 178 patients ipsilateral RT, compared with 72 bilateral RT. Dose 60/25. T1-2 66%, T3 29%; N0 57%, N1 30%; Stage III-IV 63%
**Contralateral failure: crude rate 2.6%. Stage I 0%, II 2%, III 4%, IV 0%; N0 0%, N1 4%, N2-3 0% (but 52% ipsilateral failure, ? first)  
**Conclusion: Ipsilateral RT only has results comparable to bilateral RT, with fewer side effects, and low risk of contralateral failure. Vast majority of failures inside original fields

==Proton Therapy==
*'''Loma Linda; 2005''' (1991-2002) PMID 15890592 -- &quot;Proton radiation for treatment of cancer of the oropharynx: early experience at Loma Linda University Medical Center using a concomitant boost technique.&quot; (Slater JD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jun 1;62(2):494-500.)
**Prospective. 29 patients, localized Stage II-IV oropharyngeal cancer. Accelerated mixed photon and proton RT 75.9 GyE in 45 fractions to primary disease, involved LNs and subclinical areas. Photons lateral opposed beam and anterior field for lower to 50.4/28. PT used as concomitant boost 25.5 GyE/17 starting Day 12, typically single posterior oblique field. No chemotherapy mentioned
**Outcome: 5-year LC 88%, LN control 96%, LRC 84%; 2-year DFS 81%, 5-year DFS 65%
**Toxicity: Late Grade 3 in 10%
**Conclusion: Preliminary results reveal increased LRC without increased toxicity


==Neoadjuvant Chemo==
*'''ECOG E2399''' PMID 17761982 -- &quot;Phase II trial of chemoradiation for organ preservation in resectable stage III or IV squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx or oropharynx: results of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study E2399.&quot; (Cmelak AJ, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 1;25(25):3971-7.)
**Phase II. 105 patients. Resectable T2N+ or T3-4N0-3, larynx (34%) or oropharynx (66%) squamous cell. Induction paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 x2 cycles, then concurrent paclitaxel 30 mg/m2 + RT 70 Gy. Primary endpoint organ preservation. 94% full dose RT. Median F/U 3 years
**Outcome: No progression on chemo. Organ preservation larynx 74%, OP 84%. Primary site salvage surgery larynx 19%, OP 9%. 2-year OS larynx 63%, OP 83%
**Conclusion: High organ preservation in oropharynx but not larynx</text>

* The question again is about the number of paths, but this time 4 squares are blocked in the center (marked by '*'s) that the bug is not allowed to touch (for they are sticky with glue and would trap the bug thus making it starve). What is the number of allowed paths?

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter. Europa has an icy surface. Europa is special to scientists as they believe there is an ocean under the ice. Life may live in the ocean. These lifeforms, assuming they exist, would most likely be very different than the lifeforms on Earth, even the aquatic life here. The differences will probably be very random and very large. For example, the lifeforms may have not developed sight as we know it, but could see the radio waves instead, or the micro waves instead of the colour spectrum. They might not even be solid, but liquid or gas!

[[Image:Europa-moon.jpg|right|250px]]
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Europa Facts''':
*Europa may have an ocean under its icy surface
*Some scientists think that extraterrestrial life may live in Europa's oceans
*Before this moon's current name, it was simply known as Jupiter II
*This shares a name with an asteroid, ''52 Europa'', in the asteroid belt
&lt;/div&gt;

== How big is Europa? ==
Europa is  3,122 km (0.246 Earths) across.
It would take 125 Europas to equal the weight of one Earth, and almost 67 Europas could be fit into the volume that Earth occupies if they could be molded together like lumps of clay.

== What is its surface like? ==

[[Image:Europa g1 true.jpg|left|thumb|Picture of the surface of Europa taken by the Galilleo spacecraft]]

The Europan surface is extremely smooth; few features more than a few hundred meters high have been seen. There are very few craters on Europa, and only three are more than 5 km wide. This would seem to indicate a young and active surface; based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment Europa probably endures, the surface must be no more than 30 million years old. The smoothness and visible markings strongly resemble that of sea ice on Earth, and it is thought that under the surface there is a layer of liquid water kept warm by tidally generated heat. The temperature on the surface of Europa is far below freezing, even at the equator, so water ice is as hard as rock. The largest craters appear to be filled with flat, fresh ice; based on this and on the calculated amount of heat generated by Europan tides it is predicted that the outer crust of solid ice is approximately 10-30 kilometers thick, which could mean that the liquid ocean underneath may be as deep as 90 kilometers.

[[Image:PIA01130 Interior of Europa.jpg|right|thumb|Cutaway of what we think the interior of Europa could look like]]

Europa's most striking surface feature is a series of dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe. These streaks strongly resemble the cracks that form in sea ice on Earth, and close examination shows that the edges of Europa's crust on either side of the cracks have moved relative to each other. Another way to look at it is that Europa resembles a cracked eggshell. The larger bands are roughly 20 km across with a central band of lighter material that is thought to have been produced by a series of volcanic water eruptions or geysers as the Europan crust spread open to expose warmer layers beneath. The effect is similar to that seen in the Earth's oceanic ridges. These various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal stresses exerted by Jupiter; Europa's surface is thought to rise and fall up to 30 meters between high and low tides. Since Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter- the same side always faces towards Jupiter -  the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern. However, only the youngest of Europa's fractures conform to the predicted pattern; other fractures appear to have occurred at increasingly different orientations the older they are. This can be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, which is possible due to the subsurface ocean separating the moon's surface from its rocky mantle. 

It has been suggested that life may exist in this under-ice ocean.  Scientists who suggest this point out that life can thrive in similarly harsh conditions on Earth: around deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or in the Antarctic Lake Vostok, which is also under a thick sheet of ice. There is currently no supporting evidence that life exists on Europa, but efforts have nevertheless been made to avoid any possibility of contamination. The Galileo mission was concluded by crashing the spacecraft into Jupiter—if simply abandoned, the unsterilized craft might have eventually crashed into Europa and contaminated it with microorganisms from Earth. This would have made it impossible to determine if Europa ever had its own native life, and could even destroy native organisms if they exist.

Europa's postulated ocean has excited tremendous interest in the scientific community.  Just as the Russians have been planning to drill to Lake Vostok in order to sample its water and explore for life, there has been a great deal of speculation about ways to drill through Europa's surface ice to explore it's ocean.  Finding life on Europa would be a watershed moment in the history of science.

== How long is a day on Europa? ==

It takes 85 hours (3½ Earth days) for Europa to rotate on its axis. It also takes 85 hours for Europa to complete one orbit around Jupiter. Since these numbers are the same, it means that the same side of Europa always faces Jupiter. (Earth's moon is the same way, which is why you can always see the Man in the Moon.)

== Who is it named after? ==
[[File:Raptus Europae.png|thumb|right|Europa and Zeus in the form of a white bull]]
Europa (Greek ''Ευρώπη'') is named after one of Zeus' love interests. Europa was a Phoenician princess who was abducted by Zeus and brought to Crete.

== How was it discovered? ==
Europa was discovered by two people: Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei. Galileo discovered it on January 7, 1610. Marius also observed it around the same time.

*Removed a couple of completely incorrect bits.  You cannot call a fuction like: foo(void).  The &quot;void&quot; part is correct in a declaration, but not a call.  Also, it's perfectly legal to assign an int to a float.  C allows such conversions without a cast. -- [[User:67.170.85.37|67.170.85.37]] 04:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

Umm.  C has no &quot;built-in&quot; functions.  printf comes from the standard library.  It is entirely reasonable (though painful) to write a program that doesn't link the standard library.</text>

This article explains how you can use the template to apply individual stylings for each module position. You can also create stylings for groups of modules.

==What is the issue?==

Sometimes it is useful with more than one module look on a site. A common way to create individual module stylings is to use the module class suffix function. The bad thing with this is that you need to know the code for the suffix, and insert it for every module in that position to get it styled.

This explains how to automate that, and use CSS to set default styling for all modules in a given position.

==How to do it==

To do this, you are going to wrap the module position in a div tag. This is done in the index.php file of the template. Find the module position, typically it looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules(&quot;left&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

To wrap it in the div dag, do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;leftmodules&quot;&gt;&lt;?php mosLoadModules(&quot;left&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/source&gt;</text>

The [[Wikipedia:POV-Ray|Persistence of Vision Raytracer]], or '''POV-Ray''', is a [[Wikipedia:ray tracing|ray tracing]] program available for a variety of computer platforms. It was originally based on [[Wikipedia:DKBTrace|DKBTrace]], written by David Kirk Buck and Aaron A. Collins. There are also influences from the earlier Polyray raytracer 
contributed by its author Alexander Enzmann. 
It is available free of charge.

The intentions of this book is to make it a High School textbook for use in a graphics art class. At the end of each section there will be some of the following resources that can be used in the classroom: lesson plans, assignments, solutions to assignments, quizzes, tests, and links to other resources that might be useful. 


'''Before the Beginning'''

This book will assume that you have knowledge of the  Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX operating systems and how menus, mouse movement and generic commands like copy and paste work. If there is a command that is specific to POV-Ray more details might be provided. A Requisite basic introduction to computing can be found at [[Computers for Beginners]].

== Not a programming language? Style/structure separation? ==

CSS is not a programming language --[[User:CarbonUnit]]

:I thought the whole idea of using CSS is to encourage separation of the format from the content.  Or at least that is what every page on CSS in wikidom seems to indicate.  So why do you include the alternate method of inlining the style tag?  Thus,

:Additionally, it can be added as an attribute within an HTML tag within the style attribute, as thus: 
: style=&quot;property:value&quot;

:Maybe you are intertwining the conversation about various methods of generating styles with the promotion of using CSS.

Just adding, XHTML does NOT require CSS, XHTML behaves exactly like HTML but with stricter coding rules, and CSS is technically a programming language. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:69.204.17.68|69.204.17.68]] ([[User talk:69.204.17.68|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/69.204.17.68|contribs]]) 8 July 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:With all due respect our learned friend '69.204.17.68' above, I would suggest that Cascading Stylesheets are ''not'' in fact a programming language.  There is a specified syntax, yes, but this about that is in common with a programming language.  HTML is not a programming language; BNF is not a programming language; configuation files (e.g. &lt;code&gt;.ini&lt;/code&gt; files) are not written in programming languages&amp;hellip;.  So, '''I would like to suggest we rename this book to '[[Cascading Stylesheets]]''''.  Anyone concur?  &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Users:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] (Australia) 00:20, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

:: '''Agreed.'''  CSS is not a programming language. --[[User:Sydius|Sydius]] ([[User talk:Sydius|talk]]) 03:39, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

:: '''Agreed.''' Per Sydius; CSS has no control structures such as ''if'' or ''while''. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:50, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== RE: Merging XHTML and CSS ==

CSS should not be merged with XML and/or XHTML / HTML.  (Note:  It has also been suggested to merge XHTML with XML, which could potentially result in XHTML, XML, and CSS all in one project.)  The beauty of CSS is that it's supposed to operate on XHTML/XML without having to change the XHTML / XML at all.  Intertwining the two defeats the purpose of having CSS in the first place.  A simple reference between the two, perhaps with an introductory paragraph explaining the interaction between CSS and XML, should suffice.  However, combining the books would make it difficult for someone interested only in CSS (from a design standpoint) to access the information that he or she needs, as he or she would have to filter out a great deal of extraneous information.

I do acknowledge that using CSS effectively requires a simple understanding of XHTML, but merging all of these subjects into one book is going to result in way too much complexity in one project (especially considering the minutia of detail in advanced XHTML, CSS, and XML) and make it much more difficult to organize the information in a way that is accessible to a novice user or reader.  Keeping the projects separate allows the contributors and editors to more easily manage the information in each topic, and allows each topic to advance at its own pace.

Regardless of whether CSS is &quot;technically&quot; a programming language, it should be taken into account that the primary ''use'' of CSS is design.  I think you'll find that you have an entirely different type of reader reading CSS from a design standpoint as compared to someone reading XHTML or XML from a coding/standardization standpoint.

I feel strongly that combining CSS and XML (and possibly XHTML) into one resource would result in a bloated, complicated project that would suffer greatly from lack of oversight and long-term planning due to its size, complexity, and unfocused scope.  If you are concerned about compatibility or integration issues between CSS and XML, I think the best way to address this would be to write a common article or page which could then be included (using wiki's include markup) in both books.  This would save effort and afford each book its own organization and pace of advancement.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 23:50, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

I'd like to make two points: 1) XML is a deep subject; a book on XML should not be a reference on all languages based on XML; 2) CSS is a distinct and significant enough subject to warrant separate coverage. I also echo banzaimonkey's view that Wikibooks should freely hyperlink among each other; this increases the likelihood of each work being used and thus maintained.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.42.145.83|86.42.145.83]] ([[User talk:86.42.145.83|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.42.145.83|contribs]]) 26 August 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

I have started merging duplicate content from [[XML: Managing Data Exchange/CSS]] into this book. That module will be left as an overview of CSS in the context of XML/XHTML. The details of CSS sytntax and properties will move into the relevant modules in this book. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:88.107.237.171|88.107.237.171]] ([[User talk:88.107.237.171|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/88.107.237.171|contribs]]) 6 September 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: Great, that's exactly how I'd do it, too. CSS is definitely a subject that can fill a whole book. Can we just remove the merging suggestion banner? It's been there long enough. [[User:Dilaudid|Dilaudid]] 00:46, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

== Keep Subjects Separate ==

I've noticed some extremely technical people roaming through Wikiland lately insisting the strictest of organizing standards.  Within their world, I wholly acknowledge a deep, thorough, exposition of any topic.  And if there is a Wikiway to give them that, then I'm all for it.  But Wikiland will die if it becomes too hard for average folks to get any usefull information.

HTML, CSS, XHTML, XML, XSL, the many *scripts are all interrelated.  Absolutely.  That does not mean you lump them all into one book, page or anything.  If you did that the page would lose it specialization.

Just don't do it.


--[[User:134.241.58.251|134.241.58.251]] 00:06, 25 October 2006 (UTC) Bill from Boston

== Another recommendation ==

The current Introduction needs improvement, but I'm not the one to do it. I'm here to learn CSS, not yet qualified to rewrite these pages.

What's missing for me in the introduction is something about how CSS is actually deployed. I'm gradually getting the idea that there are two ways: a) define style tags in the current page's header and then make calls on those tags in the body of the page; b) define style tags in a separate file and tell the current page to look to that file for tag definitions. I THINK that's what's going on with deployment, but this page doesn't explicitly say so, and should.

Further, it would be helpful if there were some sample code shown for both defining style tags and calling on them. An example with supporting explanatory text is always clearer than explanatory text on its own (which is what's currently on this page).

And because pages like this will attract two classes of readers, this first page should be written to satisfy both. By two classes I mean folks like myself who have seen some HTML code but that's about all (and looking to move to the next stage in their understanding) and those folks who already know several computer languages and live and breathe standards. It's a tough act to write to both audiences at once, but honestly that's what you've got. I submit, as difficult an act as that is, its essential, otherwise you'll confuse and frustrate both audiences.

Kind regards,

== Differences between browsers ==

My impression is that these pages only occasionally mention the differences between the browsers, yet _real_ CSS 'programming' often consists of making web pages work as well in one browser as another (and on different platforms, too).  (I'm by no means an expert, but have quite a lot of 'make it work' experience.)  Is there room here somewhere for pointing out what works where?  I used to use a product called TopStyle (Windows only, so I don't use it any more) which let you select a browser, or a CSS level, and you got to see what would be rendered, using the CSS you wrote.  It also showed you what properties worked with which browser, before you selected them.  Can some of that know-how get into here? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:80.177.18.39|80.177.18.39]] ([[User talk:80.177.18.39|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/80.177.18.39|contribs]]) 23 January 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Introduction cleaning ==
I did some cleanup on the introduction to make it easier to read, less redundant, and more professional.  It's still far from good (to me), but I hope it's better. --[[User:Sydius|Sydius]] ([[User talk:Sydius|talk]]) 04:13, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

: I have moved the introduction to a dedicated chaper. Hope it's okay. Many more parts are now in dedicated chapters, so the first page should provide a nice overview of the content of the book, uncluttered by the content itself. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 08:52, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== term for &quot;.classname[xxx]&quot;? ==

I couldn't find it as far as I've looked... I found this method used on WP's CSS file:
:&lt;nowiki /&gt;#content a'''[href$=&quot;.pdf&quot;]'''.external, 
It makes the links of PDF extensions have an image to the right of it. My question is: is there a term for this (bolded font), and does this book document it somewhere? -- [[Special:Contributions/203.171.195.247|203.171.195.247]] ([[User talk:203.171.195.247|talk]]) 20:55, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

:This may be a little lat for you but the answers to your questions are: 
:# '''[href$=&quot;.pdf&quot;]''' is an attribute selector, and
:# as far as I can tell at the moment it has not been added to this book yet
:Hope these belated answers helps --&lt;span style=&quot;background:lightgrey&quot;&gt;[[User:Dlrohrer2003|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Dlrohrer&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Dlrohrer2003|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;2003&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:54, 19 December 2009 (UTC)

== important ==

1) You are using a class name called &quot;important&quot; in some of the examples. Because there is a keyword &quot;important&quot; readers can get confused. 

2) [[Cascading Style Sheets/Important]] is the ;  optional for the last item in a style as implied by the examples this chapter?

This article explains very common issues in Mambo, especially concerning users that try to cope with Mambo for the first time.

==The front  page settings==

The request &quot;How do I change the settings on the front page&quot; is heard very often in the mambo support communities. I hope this article clears this up.

===Where are they?===

If you want to change any setting on the front page, that is done in the parameters of the menu item. Those parameters can be reached in the menu manager. Go to &quot;menu &gt; main menu&quot; to edit the main menu (normally, the front page link is there), and click on the link corresponding to the front page. In the list to the right, you can see a selection of parameters. Here you can edit all of  the available settings of the front page - such as the amount of columns.

===I want to have only one column on the front page!===

To set the front page to have only one column, simply change the &quot;Columns&quot; parameter. That's it, really! You might want to increase the amount of items shown by increasing the amount in the &quot;#number&quot;-parameter.

===I want only one article on the front page!===

If you want to have only one single article on the front page, that is very easy. First you will need to have a content item that you would like to use. This could be one single item from a content section, or a static content item. As soon as you have the link that you want, you simply put it at the top of the main menu - as item number one. This makes it the front page - any item that is put at the top is made to the front page of your site.

This article explains how to use the image function in mambo. The method is to use the mosimage bot, and not any editor.

== Uploading images ==

The uploading is done in Mambo's Media Manager, which you can find at &quot;Site &gt; Media Manager&quot; in the backend menu. This takes you to a image uploading interface that is very self-explanatory and easy to use.

First, browse the image you want to upload by pressing &quot;browse&quot; next to the upload field - this field is right underneath the image and folder view. Then, use the upload-button in the toolbar (at the top of the page&quot; to upload the selected image.

Note that the [mambo root]/images/stories folder need to be accessible for writing if this should work.

== Inserting images ==

The insertion of images is done with a mambot called mosimage. Most people use the editor to insert images, but there are sometimes issues with the embedded editor method.

===Find the image===

First, find the item where you want images and edit it. Then, select the images you want to use in the &quot;images&quot; tab in the parameter list to the right of the editor field(s). This is done by first selecting the appropriate folder, then selecting the appropriate image, by clicking on its file name in the list that appears under the folder selection.

Then press the &quot;add&quot; button, and the image will be added to the content item. Repeat this procedure if you want to add  multiple images.

===Place the image===

To place the images, move the cursor to where you want it to appear and click. Then, click the little flower with an i on it at the bottom of the editor window. This inserts a {mosimage}-tag.

The principle with the {mosimage} is that everywhere that is present it will be replaced with the images chosen in the images tab of the content items parameters. If you have multiple images selected, they will appear in the order they were inserted. If you have two {mosimage} tags, the first will be replaced with the first image in the selection, and the second tag will be replaced with the second image in the selection.

The primary drawback of the [mosimage] tag is that you cannot reference pages using it externally from Mambo. If you want to send html-rich emails that link to graphics on your Mambo website, using the embedded editor's link to the Media Manager will allow you to insert absolute references that can work in your html-rich email marketing.</text>

__TOC__

== Description ==

X'Terminated is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any task object. This attribute indicates if X has terminated (true) or not (false).

Be warned -- calling X'Terminated can result in a race condition. X'Terminated may be false at the time the attribute value is read, but it may become true at the time action is taken based on the value read. Once X'Terminated is true, however, it can be expected to stay true.

__TOC__

== Description ==

The 'Value [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] is defined for any scalar type. This attribute is a function that parses the string and returns the corresponding type value, if it exists. Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} S'Value (Arg: String) {{Ada/kw|return}} S'Base;

If the string does not correspond to any value of the type, then the Constraint_Error [[Ada Programming/Exceptions|exception]] is raised.

There are corresponding attributes for Wide_String and Wide_Wide_String.

Don't confuse this attribute with the [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Val]] attribute.
== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Enum {{Ada/kw|is}} (Enum1, Enum2, Enum3);
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Value (&quot;ENUM1&quot;)    = Enum1); {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Value (&quot;  ENUM1 &quot;) = Enum1); {{Template:Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Assert}} (My_Enum'Value (&quot;ZOWIE!&quot;)   = Enum1); {{Template:Ada/comment|Wrong! Constraint_Error is raised}}

We should probably update the example here to include setting 'Size (not just reading).

=== Shure ===

Shure, go ahead! There is realy no reason to discuss it ;-).

Suggestion: set it to Interfaces.C.int - to get a C99 compatible bool.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
== Dialogue 4==
'''Ricardo''': Bom dia, João. De onde é você?&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Sou americano, mas agora moro em Lisboa. E você?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Sou de Londres.&lt;br&gt;
'''João''':É inglês?  &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Os meus pais são portugueses. Eles moram em Londres. &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Gosta de Lisboa?&lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Sim, muito.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This time Ricardo and João are talking about where they live, and what nationality they are.

'''De onde é você?''' - ''Where are you from''?

By now you may have picked up that, like in a couple of other European languages, the word for &quot;of&quot; or &quot;from&quot; is '''de'''. The word '''onde''' means &quot;where&quot;. To avoid ambiguity, in this case você is used most of the time. And finally, you should remember '''é''' - it means &quot;he/she/it is&quot; or &quot;you are&quot; (when using você) - as part of the verb '''ser'''. 

João responds thus:

'''Sou de Lisboa''' - ''I am from Lisbon''.

Can you remember what '''sou''' means? It means &quot;I am&quot; (when using '''ser''' as the verb). So we have &quot;I am from...&quot;. Of course, you can put anything after the &quot;de&quot;.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;
'''Translate the following into English.'''

1. Sou de Melbourne.

2. Você é de Washington

3. Eles são do Rio de Janeiro.

4. Tu és de Paris.


'''Translate the following into Portuguese'''

5. I am from Edinburgh

6. You are from Auckland. (use '''tu''')

7. Where is she from?

8. Where do we come from? 


'''Answers'''

1. I am from Melbourne

2. You are from Washington

3. They are from Rio.

4. You are from Paris.

5. (Eu) sou de Edinburgh

6. Tu és de Auckland

7. De onde é ela? (Use '''ela''' in this case because context doesn't tell us who '''é''' refers to)

8. De onde somos? (But because '''somos''' is only used to mean &quot;we are&quot; we can always omit the word for &quot;we&quot;)

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt;

If you were looking closely at the dialogue, you may have spotted a way to tell someone where you come from in a different way. Instead of saying, &quot;I am from France&quot; - '''Sou de França''' - you can say &quot;I am French&quot;.

In Portuguese, this is done as in English - by using the verb &quot;ser&quot; and an adjective, like &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Australian&quot;. Why do we use '''ser'''? Because your nationality is a permanent feature of you. It is WHAT you are, rather than HOW you are at a particular moment.

However first we need to have a look at the different nationalities.

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c1e5e8&quot;&gt;belga&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dbe8c4&quot;&gt;belgas&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c1e5e8&quot;&gt;belgas&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Some examples?

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''as meninas canadianas''' - the Canadian girls (feminine, plural)

'''a mulher australiana''' - the Australian woman (feminine, singular)

'''o homem belga''' - the Belgian man (masculine, singular)

'''os homens franceses''' - the French men (masculine, plural - notice the change from '''homem''' to '''homens''')

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As pointed out above, something strange goes on when we talk about more than one '''homem''' (man). Instead of '''homems''' we get '''homeNs''' (men).

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;
You now know how to say who you are, where you come from, what you like doing and what you are going to do on a certain day. As a practice, write a letter to an imaginary Portuguese penfriend, using your knowledge of basic Portuguese vocabulary. Include questions - for example, ''''Como se chama''' você?

&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/table&gt;

Cuban food, unlike the cuisine of other tropical countries of Latin America, is not spicy. It is, however, excellent and can be very healthy.

== Basic Ingredients ==
===Rice and beans===
White rice and [[Cookbook:Arroz con Frijoles Negros|black beans]] are the staple of every Cuban meal, and exist separately (Arroz con Frijoles Negros) or mixed together (Moros y Cristianos). Moros y Cristianos literally means &quot;Moors and Christians&quot; named because the beans are black (Moors) and the rice is white (Christians).

===Pork===
Pork is a very common meat consumed in Cuban Cuisine, typically prepared as &quot;Lechon&quot;, or suckling pig. 

== Cuban-American Food ==
A typical way to cook Cuban meat is to begin with a &quot;sofrito.&quot; A sofrito consists of garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, an onion, and perhaps a red bell pepper chopped and sauteed in a frying pan. After this base is prepared, the meat- whether chicken, beef, or fish- is added and cooked with the flavors. 
Because so many Cubans fled to Miami during the 1960s after Fidel Castro came to power, a lot of authentic Cuban food can be found in Miami. Some may claim that the Cuban food in Miami is better than that in Cuba, because of the greater variety and quality of spices, meats and vegetables available.

'''''Arroz con pollo''''' (rice with chicken) is a traditional dish that's common throughout Spain and [[w:Latin America|Latin America]] especially in Cuba, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic. However, it resembles [[cookbook:Paella Valenciana|paella]], a Spanish dish, both in its ingredients and cooking technique, and may very well be a New World adaptation of it.

Common ingredients for ''arroz con pollo'' include rice, vegetables, fresh herbs and chicken.

==Ingredients==
*A 1.3 to 1.8 kg [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] cut into serving pieces
*[[cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]] [[wikt:to taste|to taste]]
*[[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*4 [[wikt:clove|cloves]] of fresh, [[wikt:minced|minced]] [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*1 medium [[cookbook:onion|onion]], [[wikt:chopped|chopped]]
*225 g diced [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red bell pepper]]
*425 g (1 [[wikt:can|can]]) [[wikt:diced|diced]] [[cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 7.5 g (1/2 tablespoon) sweet [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
* 14 g (1/2 oz) chopped [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]]
* 1.4 liter (6 cups) chicken [[wikt:bouillon|bouillon]]
*8 [[cookbook:saffron|saffron]] threads or 1 teaspoon [[w:food coloring|food coloring]] for yellow rice
* 370 g (2 cups) medium or long-grain [[Cookbook:rice|rice]]
* 225 g (8 oz) [[Cookbook:peas|canned peas]] ([[wikt:thoroughly|thoroughly]] [[wikt:drained|drained]])

==Procedure==
#Season the chicken with two pinches of salt and a pinch of pepper.
#Pour enough olive oil into a large skillet to just barely cover the bottom.
#[[Cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] chicken in oil until brown. There are two ways to proceed from here: Either remove the chicken from the skillet or keep it there.
#Sauté garlic until brown. Be careful, garlic burns easily.
#Add the onion, bell pepper, tomatoes and paprika. Sauté until the vegetables are tender.
#Transfer the ingredients to a large stewing pot.
#Add the cilantro, bouillon and saffron (or food coloring). Bring to a rolling [[Cookbook:boil|boil]]. 
#Add the rice and mix well. Simmer over medium heat until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Add more broth or water if the liquid evaporates before the rice is cooked.
#Add the chicken to the pot (if you removed it previously) and cover it with rice. Wait two to three minutes to allow the chicken to warm.
#Sprinkle peas on top of the rice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bible''' (books, from biblos, the inner bark of the papyrus, on which the ancients wrote), the collection of the sacred writings or Holy Scriptures of the Christians. Its two main divisions, one received by both Jews and Christians, the other by Christians alone, are termed Testaments. The original languages of the Bible are Aramaic, Greek and Hebrew, the latter being the best adapted for the many styles of composition. The Jewish religion being represented as a compact between God and the Jews, the Christian religion was regarded as a new compact between God and the human race; and the Bible is, therefore, properly divisible into the Writings of the Old and New Covenants. The 24 protocanonical books of the Old Testament received by the Jews were divided by them into three classes: 1, The Law, contained in the Pentateuch. 2, The Prophets, comprising Joshua, Judges, I and II Samuel, I and II Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the twelve minor prophets. 3, The Ketuvim (holy writings), containing the Psalms, Proverbs, Job, in one division; Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, the Song of Solomon, in another division; Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah, I and II Chronicles, in a third. These books are extant in the Hebrew language; others have been rejected from the canon as apocryphal by Protestants, although for some time those of a pseudepigraphical nature were inserted as intertestamental works. The 72 books in the [[/Bible canonization|Bible canonization]] according to the Council of Trent, including parts of the Apocrypha, are sacred to Roman Catholics.

The books of Moses, with other sacred writings, were deposited, according to the Bible, in the tabernacle near the ark. They were removed by Solomon to the temple, and on the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar they probably perished. According to Jewish tradition Ezra, with the assistance of the great synagogue, collected and compared as many copies as could be found, and from this collation an edition of the whole was prepared, with the exception of the writings of Ezra, Malachi and Nehemiah, added subsequently, and certain obviously later insertions in other books. When Judas Maccabeus repaired the temple, he placed in it a correct copy of the Hebrew scriptures. This copy was carried to Rome by Titus. The exact date of the Hebrew canon is uncertain, but no work known to be written later than about 100 years after the captivity was admitted into it by the Jews of Palestine. The Alexandrian Jews, however, were less strict and admitted many later writings, forming what is now known as the Apocrypha, in which they were followed by the Latin Church. The Protestant churches at the reformation gave their adherence to the restricted Hebrew canon, though the Apocrypha was long included in the various editions of the Bible. The division into chapters and verses, as it now exists, is of comparatively modern origin, though divisions of some kind were early introduced. About the middle of the sixteenth century the verses were for the first time marked by numbers.

The earliest and most famous translation of the Old Testament is the Septuagint, or Greek translation, executed by Alexandrian Greeks, and completed probably before 130 B.C.E. This version was adopted by the early Christian church and by the Jews themselves and has always held an important place in the interpretation and history of the Bible. The Syriac version, the Peshito, made early in the second century C.E., is celebrated for its fidelity. The Coptic version was made from the Septuagint, in the third or fourth century. The Gothic version, by Ulphilas, was made from the Septuagint in the fourth century, but mere insignificant fragments of it are extant. The most important Latin version is the Vulgate, executed by Jerome, partly on the basis of the original Hebrew, and completed in 405 AD.

The nearly intact Great Isaiah Scroll from the Dead Sea discoveries dating from the 2nd century BC is almost identical to the manuscript version of the Masoretic text from the 900's AD The oldest complete Hebrew Bible dates from 1009 and resides at the Saltykhov-Shchedrin State Library in Leningrad. This codex is a priceless work of pen and parchment and was ignored for close to a hundred years by a state that shunned religion. The Masorete scribe’s name, that of Schmuel ben Yaacov, is intact, complete with the margin notes or Masora. The printing of the Old Testament between 1450 and 1455 was the first book printed by Gutenberg reproducing the Latin Vulgate text which came to be known as the Mazarin Bible, being found years later in the library of Cardinal Mazarin. The rapid spread of knowledge made possible by Gutenberg's printing press contributed to the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, and the Protestant Reformation. The printed editions of the ancient Hebrew Bible are very numerous. The first entire edition was printed at Soncino, Italy in 1488. 

The books of the New Testament were all written in Greek, unless it be true, as some critics suppose and attested to by Papias, that the gospel of Saint Matthew was originally written in Hebrew (or Aramaic). Most of these writings have always been received as canonical; but the Epistle to the Hebrews, commonly ascribed to Saint Paul, that of Saint Jude, the second of Peter, the second and third of John and the Apocalypse, have been doubted. The three oldest manuscripts are: 1, the Sinaitic manuscript, discovered by Tischendorf in a convent on Mount Sinai in 1859, assigned to the middle of the fourth century; 2, the Vaticanus manuscript at Rome, of similar date; 3, the Alexandrian manuscript in the British Museum, assigned to the fifth century. Each manuscript contains also in great part the Septuagint Greek of the Old Testament. The Vulgate of Jerome embraces a Latin translation of the New, as well as of the Old Testament, based on an older Latin version. The division of the text of the New Testament into chapters and verses was introduced later than that of the Old Testament, but it is not precisely known when or by whom.
[[Image:Isaiah_XII.jpg|right|320px|thumb|&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;Isaiah: chapter 12 &amp;nbsp;William Tyndale (1534).&lt;/span&gt;]]
Of translations of the Bible into modern languages the English and the German are the most celebrated. Considerable portions of the Holy Book were translated into Anglo-Saxon, including the Gospels and the Psalter. Wycliffe's translation of the whole Bible (from the Vulgate), begun about 1356, was completed shortly before his death, 1384. The translation spearheaded by Martin Luther, published in its entirety in 1534, by reason of its widespread circulation facilitated the emergence of the modern German language by standardizing it for the peoples of the Holy Roman Empire that would become Germany in the nineteenth century, and it is considered a landmark in German literature. The first printed version of the Bible in English was the translation of William Tyndale, whose New Testament was printed in quarto at Cologne in 1525, a small octavo edition appearing at the same time at Worms. He also published the Pentateuch in 1530 and translated some of the prophetical books before his public execution. Tyndale's translations from the original languages became the foundation of subsequent English versions. A translation of the entire Bible, undertaken at the instance of Thomas Cromwell, was published by Miles Coverdale in 1535 and, being made from German and Latin versions, was inferior to Tyndale's. The first Bible printed by authority in England was an edition with a preface by Cranmer, hence called Cranmer's Bible. A royal proclamation in 1540 ordered it to be placed in every parish church. This continued, with various revisions, to be the authorized version till 1568. In 1557-1560 an edition appeared at Geneva, based on Tyndale's—the work of Whittingham, Coverdale, Goodman, Gilby, with the influence of John Knox and other exiles, and commonly called the Geneva, or Breeches Bible, from &quot;breeches&quot; standing instead of &quot;aprons&quot; in Genesis 3: 7. This version, the first printed in Roman letters, and also the first to adopt the plan, previously adopted in the Hebrew, of a division into verses, was for sixty years the most popular in England and was allowed to be printed under a patent of monopoly in 1561. It separated the Apocrypha except for the Prayer of Manasseh, left the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews open and put words not in the original in italics. The Bishop's Bible, published 1568 to 1572, revised by Archbishop Parker and eight bishops, succeeded Cranmer's as the authorized version, but did not commend itself to scholars or the people. In 1582 an edition of the New Testament, translated from the Latin Vulgate, appeared at Rheims, and in 1609-1610 the Old Testament was published at Douay. This was the English version recognized by the Roman Catholic Church.

In the reign of James I, Hugh Broughton, a Hebrew scholar, insisted on the necessity of a new translation, and at the Hampton Court Conference (1604) the suggestion was accepted by the king. The work was undertaken by forty-seven scholars, divided into six companies, two meeting at Westminster, two at Oxford and two at Cambridge, while a general committee meeting in London revised the portions of the translation finished by each. The revision was begun in 1607 and occupied three years, the completed work being published in folio in 1611 and known as King James' Bible. Through the general accuracy of its translation and the purity of its style, it superseded all other versions. In response, however, to a widespread desire for a translation even freer from errors, the Convocation of Canterbury in 1870 appointed a committee to consider the question of revising the English version. Their report being favorable, two companies were formed, one for the Old Testament and one for the New, consisting partly of members of the Convocation and partly of outside scholars. Two similar companies were also organized in America, to work along with the British scholars. The result was that the Revised version of the New Testament was issued in 1881; that of the Old Testament appeared in 1884. The American Standard Version, its variant embodying the preferences of the American scholars associated in the work, was published in 1901.

This is a technical companion to [[w:Charlie Stross|Charlie Stross]]'s novel [[w:Accelerando (novel)|Accelerando]]. Stross's book can be quite dense in unusual technical terms and concepts, which can sometimes be quite confusing to readers unfamiliar with them. The purpose of this companion is to help alleviate any confusions the reader may have, as well as to introduce new confusions by giving the reader an idea of the current state and expected future of the technologies described in the novel. Wherever possible, brief information on relevant research papers is provided.

Accelerando is not a &quot;post-Singularity&quot; novel but rather a &quot;through-Singularity&quot; novel as it takes the reader from our days (the first chapter &quot;Lobsters&quot; can be situated slightly in the future, maybe around 2020) through a Singularity to a sketched post-Singularity world. In the novel Stross focuses more on the social impact of technologies pushing to a Singularity and only hints at the technologies themselves. The aim of this technical companion is filling the gaps and providing Accelerando readers with a technical background.

From a recent [http://www.computercrowsnest.com/features/arc/2005/nz8468.php online interview with Charlie Stross]: &quot;Accelerando starts out with a post-dot-com hustler, Manfred Macx. Manfred is already borderline posthuman, and he's struggling to keep up; within a generation he's an obsolete burnout case, his daughter Amber has transmigrated into a simulation space hosted aboard a one kilogram starship, and they're dismantling the solar system to build more brains. A generation later ...&quot;

The novel is available as a free download from the official site, and will also be available for purchase in bookstores on July 1, 2005.

The first part of this technical companion is a glossary, intended to explain and elaborate on concepts without giving away plot details. Keep in mind, however, that simply knowing that the novel involves a particular term may be a spoiler in some sense, so some may wish to defer consultation of the glossary. Indeed, part of the appeal of Accelerando is the sense of confusion one gets by being exposed to the technical flurry. 

The second part is a chapter guide, where chapter-specific commentary is given. This is bound to be chock-full of spoilers.

'''Boötes Void:''' A roughly spherical region of relatively empty space 250 million light-years in diameter. Discovered in 1981 by Robert Kirshner, Augustus Oemler, Jr., Paul Schechter and Stephen Shectman in a survey of galactic redshifts. See: [[wikipedia:Bootes void]]

'''Bose-Einstein condensate:''' A Bose–Einstein condensate is a phase of matter formed by bosons cooled to temperatures very near to absolute zero (0 kelvins or -273.15 degrees Celsius). Under such supercooled conditions, a large fraction of the atoms collapse into the lowest quantum state, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale. See: [[wikipedia:Bose-Einstein condensate]]

'''Brown Dwarf:''' Brown dwarfs are sub-stellar objects with a mass below that necessary to maintain hydrogen-burning nuclear fusion reactions in their cores, as do stars on the main sequence, but which have fully convective surfaces and interiors, with no chemical differentiation by depth. Brown dwarfs occupy the mass range between that of large gas-giant planets and the lowest mass stars (anywhere between 75 and 80 Jupiter masses). See: [[wikipedia:Brown Dwarf]]

=== C ===
'''Cartesian theatre:''' Descartes suggested that the brain served to pre-process sensory information and deliver it to the &quot;seat of the soul,&quot; or homunculus (Latin, literally, &quot;little man&quot;).  He proposed that this function might be somewhat like the viewing of a play, wherein the sole audience member, the soul, views the perceptions delivered by the brain as if in a theatre.  Thus the &quot;Cartesian Theatre.&quot;  

'''C:''' The speed of light.

'''CCAA:'''

'''cellular automata:''' A discrete model studied in computability theory, mathematics, and theoretical biology. It consists of an infinite, regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. Time is also discrete, and the state of a cell at time t is a function of the states of a finite number of cells (called its neighborhood) at time t-1. See: [[wikipedia:cellular automata]]

'''cladistic tree:''' A tree-like relationship-diagram, called a &quot;cladogram&quot;, that is drawn up to show different hypotheses of biological relationships. See: [[wikipedia:cladistics]]

'''computronium:''' Computronium is a class of materials optimized to perform computation. In Accelerando, post-Singularity posthumans convert much of the Solar System's mass to Computronium to sustain the huge volume of computation, including &quot;running&quot; uploaded humans, characteristic of a post-Singularity civilization. See also [[wikipedia:computronium]].

'''eigenface:''' In layperson's terms, eigenfaces are a set of &quot;standardized face ingredients&quot;, derived from statistical analysis of many pictures of faces. Any human face can be considered to be a combination of these standard faces. For more information see [[wikipedia:eigenface]].

'''entanglement:''' see '''quantum entanglement''' below.

'''exocortex:''' See [[wikipedia:exocortex]].  See also Chapter Guide, below.

'''extropian:''' Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting considerable advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and the like. Many extropians foresee the eventual realization of unlimited maximum life spans, and the recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology, of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of cryonics. See [[wikipedia:Extropianism]].

=== F ===
'''field circus:''' In hacker jargon, field circus is a derogatory pun on the field service organization of a hardware manufacturer. See [http://www.comedia.com/hot/jargon-4.2.3/html/entry/field-circus.html]

=== S ===
'''singularity''': See [[wikipedia:technological singularity]]. Accelerando's author Charles Stross edits a personal wiki dedicated to the Singularity: &quot;
[http://www.accelerando.org/_static/toughguide.html Singularity! A Tough Guide to the Rapture of the Nerds].
&quot;

'''Slashdotting''': A large influx of visitors to a web server, due to a link from the front page of slashdot.org, a popular web site for technology-related news. The influx can be quite taxing on server processing power and bandwidth, and can often incapacitate a site. For more information see [[wikipedia:Slashdot effect]].

'''small-world network''': A class of random graphs where most nodes are also neighbors of one another, but every node can be reached from every other by a small number of hops or steps. See [[wikipedia:small-world network]], [[wikipedia:Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]], and [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmallWorldNetwork.html].

'''strange attractor''': In dynamical systems, an attractor is a set to which the system evolves after a long enough time. For the set to be an attractor, trajectories that get close enough to the attractor must remain close even if slightly disturbed. Geometrically, a strange attractor is a complicated set with fractal structures. For more information see [[wikipedia:strange attractor]].

'''syncitium''': A concept introduced by Camillo Golgi (the same Italian biologist whose name is given to a component of the living cell).  Golgi believed (incorrectly) that all neurons are connected by fibers which intermingle and mesh, and syncitium is the name he gave to the whole.  The hyphae (strands) of many fungi are syncitial: long open cellular tubes with multiple nuclei but no internal cell walls, as opposed to one cell-controlling nucleus per partitioned-off cell.  This seems to be the sense in which Stross uses the term.

=== T ===
'''Thompson hack''': a type of back door (security hole) in a computer program which is undetectable even by examining the source code because it is introduced by the compiler, which itself contains this type of back door. See [[wikipedia:Backdoor_%28computing%29#Reflections_on_Trusting_Trust]].

'''timing channel attack''':  An attack against an encryption scheme based on measuring the time taken to execute different operations.

'''Tipler, Frank J.''': Currently a professor at Tulane University, a proponent of Omega Point Theory. For more information see [[wikipedia:Frank J. Tipler]] and [[wikipedia:Omega point]].

'''Turing Oracle''': A method for determining whether a given program ever halts.  There is no algorithm to do this.  Access to a Turing Oracle is near-godlike computing power.  For instance, one could prove Fermat's Last Theorem (or almost any other theorem) by writing a program that tries all possible x, y, z, and n until it finds a solution of x^n+y^n=z^n, then asking the Turing Oracle whether the program will ever find a solution.  It would also factor large integers, fold proteins, etc.

'''Turing Test''': Proposal for a way to judge whether a computer is intelligent, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. See [[wikipedia:Turing Test]].

=== U ===
'''uploading''': The transfer of a mind to a computer. For more information see [[wikipedia:mind transfer]].

=== V ===
'''van Eck radiation''': The electromagnetic emissions of a computer display or processor, the act of detecting and reconstructing which is known as [http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,289893,sid9_gci550525,00.html van Eck phreaking], in a form of electronic eavesdropping. See [[wikipedia:van Eck radiation]], [[wikipedia:Cryptonomicon]].

'''Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket''':  The variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR) is a hypothetical form of spacecraft propulsion that uses radio waves and magnetic fields to accelerate a propellant. See [[wikipedia:Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket]].

The scientist and astronaut [[w:Franklin Chang-Diaz|Franklin Chang-Diaz]] created VASIMR.

=== W ===
'''Wunch''' one of the minor villains of the book, are described as the elements of a run-amok financial institution, roughly termed &quot;economics 2.0&quot;. It is likely that the Wunch are so named as a [[wikipedia:spoonerism]] play on &quot;wunch of bankers.&quot;

== Units of time ==

Since measuring time in units like days, months, and years are of limited usefulness in regions not on the planet Earth, one often sees the usage of time measures based on the [[wikipedia:second|second]], such as megaseconds or gigaseconds. As most people aren't used to thinking in these units, conversions are listed here to and from the more conventional units.

See also [[wikipedia:Orders of magnitude (time)]].

=== Second-style -&gt; conventional ===

*1 kilosecond: 16.7 minutes
*1 megasecond: 11.6 days
*1 gigasecond: 32 years
*1 terasecond: 32,000 years
*1 petasecond: 32,000,000 years
*1 [[w:light second|light second]]: 299,792,458 metres (not actually a unit of time)

=== Conventional -&gt; second-style ===

*1 hour: 3.6 kiloseconds
*1 Earth day: 86.4 kiloseconds
*1 week: 604.8 kiloseconds
*1 Earth month (30 days): 2.6 megaseconds
*1 Earth year: 31.6 megaseconds
*1 century: 3.16 gigaseconds

== Chapter guide ==

=== Part 1: Slow Takeoff ===

==== Chapter 1: Lobsters ====

Chapter 1 introduces two similar, but clearly separate, concepts that apply to various characters throughout the remainder of the book: metacortices and exocortices. Though etymologically similar, the two are quite different--the former, in effect, being composed in various ways of the latter. An EXOcortex can best be described as the portion of a trans- or posthuman entity's brain (or cortex) which exists outside of that entity's primary computing structure, usually the brain inhabiting a person's &quot;meatbody.&quot; For example, a person's exocortex could very well be composed of all the external memory modules, processor, and devices that the person's biological brain interacts with on a realtime basis, thereby in effect making those external devices a functional part of the individual's &quot;mind.&quot; A METAcortex, on the other hand, is a processing construction built entirely out of the connections between other processing constructions--a sort of &quot;higher brain&quot; composed of lesser brains, all of which contribute to its functionality.

A simple metaphor taken from contemporary IT describes this distinction nicely. Any technology you, as an individual, use to magnify or supplement your brain's natural functionality on a daily basis can be considered components of your EXOcortex; for example, a desktop and/or laptop computer...or even a pocket calculator! These devices, however, are almost certainly networked with millions of similar devices (other folks' computers/servers/etc.) via the Internet--which, as a collective processing and data-storage organ, can be considered a METAcortex encompassing but also transcending (in functionality) the sum of all its parts.

Manny refers to his robot pet cat as &quot;his aineko.&quot; This is a bastardized Japanese word meaning &quot;pet cat&quot; (the correct Japanese would be &quot;aibyō&quot; (愛猫); the second character can be read as either &quot;neko&quot; or &quot;byō&quot;, but in this context, the latter is correct). The word is a nice pun on top of &quot;AI neko&quot; or &quot;AI cat&quot;, as Manny does use the cat as a storage of PDA-like information, and &quot;ai&quot; can also mean &quot;love&quot;. The name is also an apparent reference to the Sony [[wikipedia:Aibo|Aibo]] (a name that can be read several ways, but means &quot;pet robot&quot;).

==== Chapter 2: Troubadour ====

As he arrives at the Luton airport at the beginning of the chapter, Manny makes an offhand reference to President Santorum's America, most likely referring to a future in which a decadent U.S. is presided by current (as of the book's writing) chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, [[w:Rick_Santorum | Rick Santorum]] (of [[w:Santorum_controversy | homosexual controversy]] fame).

==== Chapter 3: Tourist ====

''widespread public paranoia about limbic spam''

The [[w:limbic system|limbic system]] is a group of brain structures involved in various emotions such as aggression, fear, pleasure and also in the formation of memory. Presumably limbic spam would be unwanted signals which delivers a stimulus directly to this area for advertising purposes.

''pointy-haired management''

A clear reference to the Pointy-Haired Boss of [http://www.dilbert.com/ Dilbert] comics.

''Should have known you'd read Vinge''

[[w:Vernor_Vinge|Vernor Vinge]] is credited with popularizing the idea of a [[w:transhumanism|transhumanist]] [[w:technological Singularity|technological Singularity]] in fiction, and explores it in his novels [[w:Marooned_in_Realtime|Marooned in Realtime]] and (indirectly) [[w:A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep|A Fire Upon the Deep]].

=== Part 2: Point of Inflection ===

==== Chapter 4: Halo ====

==== Chapter 5: Router ====

''Hyundai +4904/-56'' is a [[Wikipedia:brown dwarf|brown dwarf]] discovered around 2010 by an infrared deep scan, moving quickly with respect to the stellar neighborhood of the Sun. Amber Macx and her friends journey to Hyundai +4904/-56 following the discovery of a &quot;router&quot; orbiting the star. The router is a wormhole in a galactic network. 

''pocket universe'' (usage: &quot;arguments proliferate indefinitely in the pocket universe of the ship&quot;) in the context, the ship is merely a container, with the crew/passengers being pure software; they and their chosen environment(s) are simulations run in real-time upon the computing matrix this is the entirety of the cargo/hull (&quot;simulation space populated by upload minds&quot;).  

''cultural delta'' can be loosely described as the rate of change imposed upon culture/society by the speed and depth of new technology; for a small population semi-isolated from the main body of society, it is a reflection that no matter how hip and intelligent any given group could be, it is impossible for a 'small town' to be as creative as a 'large city';

''fork repeatedly'' is what malware such as a virus would do upon penetration; ceaselessly duplicate itself until running out resources (primarily RAM); if expressed as a cliché, it would be: &quot;when you reach a fork in the road, take both&quot;. See [[Wikipedia:Fork (operating system)]], and the attack itself is called a [[Wikipedia:Fork bomb]]

''starwhisp'' (Originally spelled ''starwisp'' by the coiner of the term, [[Wikipedia:Robert L. Forward|Robert L. Forward]]) being a class of human-built space exploration probes; the name is intended to suggest the relative size (small) and mass (low--generally of the order of grams, or at most, a few kilograms) when compared to such fictional behemoths as the USS Enterprise. 

''immortagens'' (context: &quot;cheap immortagens&quot;)

''adjuvants'' (context: &quot;out-of-control personality adjuvants&quot;) See [[Wikipedia:Adjuvant]].

''watchdog thread'' It is common in embedded computing to have a watchdog timer.  This timer must be serviced periodically by the main program, or else it will force a reset of the system.  This is to prevent bugs in the main program which would normally hang the system.

''web of trust'' [[Wikipedia:Web of trust]]

''Basilisk attacks'' are based on a concept popularized by British SF author [[Wikipedia:David Langford|David Langford]]. A [[Wikipedia:David Langford#Basilisks|basilisk]] is a visual representation which causes harm (usually death) by triggering a thought which the human brain is physically or logically incapable of thinking.

''network raids''

''nanosats''

''intelligence amplification''

==== Chapter 6: Nightfall ====


=== Part 3: Singularity ===

==== Chapter 7: Curator ====

''Utility fog'' Nanobots with extending arms reaching in several different directions, and can perform lattice reconfiguration. Utility fog is sometimes thought of as a nanotechnological version of the Swiss Army Knife. [[Utility fog]]



==== Chapter 8: Elector ====

''God bothering (applied theological engineering)'' probably refers to the use of technology in the act of prayer.  A ''god'' in this case would be a post-human, and this ''bothering'' would be an attempt to get the ''god's'' attention.  An example might be a [[w:Denial-of-service attack|DDOS attack]].

Nono, god bothering means bothering people in an attempt to infect them with your particular religious meme! No wonder it should be the greatest crime of the future when even murder is allowed, because once infected it's almost impossible to rescue people from this!

''eigensister?''
Alternate states later collapsing.  So two shades - duplicate mindstates - of the same person sent to experience different things and later converging on each other would be eigensisters.  When they merged they would presumably collapse into a single state.  Which seems non-trivial.

==== Chapter 9: Survivor ====

      <text xml:space="preserve">By now, we have seen many verbs, like '''gostar''', '''ser''', '''estar''' and '''ter'''. Up until now, we have looked at the various conjugations of these verbs individually. However, for the vast majority of Portuguese verbs, there are simple rules to follow in order to get the various conjugations for a verb. In Portuguese, there are three main types of verbs: those that end with '''-ar''', those that end in '''er''' and '''ir'''. Of these, some are ''irregular'' - that means the rules don't apply. However, most of them are ''regular''. Now we'll have a look at the most commmon types of verbs, those that end in '''-ar'''.

== How big is Deimos? ==
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Mars}}

Deimos is one of the smallest moons in the solar system at only 12 km in diameter, or about 1/2 the diameter of Phobos.  Surprisingly, however, Deimos was spotted and identified as a moon before Phobos, partly because of its greater distance from Mars, which meant that it was not so hidden in the glare of Mars' light.  The surface area of Deimos is roughly the size of a medium-sized city on the Earth.  It is also very irregular in shape, due to its small size.

From the viewpoint of somebody standing on Mars, Deimos would appear almost as just a very bright star, and you would not be able to identify any surface features without a telescope.

== What is its surface like? ==
[[File:Deimos Surface.png|thumb|right|300px|A view of the surface of Deimos from only 30km away]]

The surface of Deimos has no atmosphere of any kind, and it is full of craters from meteors hitting the surface, just like the Earth's Moon.  The surface of Deimos is made up of very dark rocks called '''carbonaceous chondrite''', which includes a lot of the element carbon.  There is also water ice on the surface of Deimos, as well as most of the interior.

Deimos has two named craters: Swift and Voltaire. Swift is named after Irishman Johnathan Swift (1667&amp;ndash;1745), the author of Gulliver's Travels. Swift is the smaller out of the two named craters, having a 1000 m diameter, while Voltaire has a 1900 m diameter. The person Voltaire (1694&amp;ndash;1778) was a French supporter of freedom of religion and freedom of expression.

Because Deimos is so small, the gravity on Deimos is very, very small.  It is about 1/2500th of the force of gravity here on the Earth.  This is so little gravity that it would be very dangerous for people to walk on the surface without a '''tether''' or some other restraint to keep them from pushing themselves completely away from Deimos.  If there were a structure on Deimos built for humans, it would resemble an orbital space station inside.

Because Deimos is '''tidally locked''' to Mars, it always keeps one side facing Mars during its entire orbit.  This means that if you were on the side facing Mars, you would always see Mars in the same part of the sky all of the time.  The other side would never see Mars in the sky.  On the side facing Mars, the view of Mars itself takes up almost one eleventh of the sky, so Mars itself would be a very significant object to look at.

One of the reasons why scientists are interested in exploring Deimos is because it is believed to be an asteroid that was captured by Mars many millions of years ago.  By studying Deimos and its brother moon Phobos, scientists hope to get a very close view of what other asteroids of a very similar size also look like elsewhere in the Solar System.

== How long is a day on Deimos? ==

A &quot;day&quot; on Deimos last about 30.5 hours.

== How long is its orbit around Mars? ==

Deimos is '''tidally locked''' to Mars, so a day on Deimos is precisely the same as the time it takes to orbit Mars. From the surface of Mars, Deimos still appears to rise from the east and set in the west like the Sun, planets, and everything else in the sky (except Phobos), but it lingers in the sky for a very long time, taking almost 3 sols (Martian days) before it sets in the western sky.

[[File:Transit of Deimos from Mars.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Deimos passing in front of the Sun, as seen by the Mars Rover Opportunity]]

== Does Deimos cause a solar eclipse on Mars? ==

Just as the Earth's Moon can come between the Earth and the Sun, Deimos occasionally comes between Mars and the Sun.  This is also called a '''transit''', and in this case perhaps transit is a more appropriate term than eclipse.

Because Deimos is so tiny and relatively far away from Mars as well, the portion of the Sun that is covered by Deimos during an eclipse is very small, and somebody standing on the ground on Mars would hardly even notice. It is similar to taking a flashlight and putting a small pebble on it. You can't see much difference in the light that comes from the flashlight.

== Who is it named after? ==

Deimos (Ancient Greek ''Δεῖμος'') is named after the Greek son of Ares (the Greek name for Mars), who is also called &quot;panic&quot; or even &quot;dread&quot;. In Greek mythology, Deimos was the personification of terror. Deimos, together with Phobos and others, would often accompany Ares into battle with gods.

[[File:Asaph_Hall_Older.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Asaph Hall, the discoverer of Phobos]]

== How was it discovered? ==
Asaph Hall was an astronomer with the '''United States Naval Observatory''', where he studied many of the planets and objects in the Solar System.  In 1877 he discovered both Deimos and, less than two hours later, Phobos, and classified them as moons of Mars. The name for Deimos was suggested by Henry Madan, based on the book '''Iliad''', a classical Greek book about mythology.

Tip: A good goal for games is that the game in itself is fun enough to play even if you are not trying to practice a language.

=== Guess the person ===
Have each student write the names of about eight famous people on slips of paper, fold up the slips and collect them in one pile. Form teams of at least two people. One person takes a slip of paper and tries to get his team to guess the name written there without saying the name or its spelling. Each team should have about one minute per round. For every name that the team guesses correctly, it receives one point (they can keep the slip of paper to count). At the end of the time, the team that guessed the most names correctly, wins.

[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|Bust of the philosopher Socrates. Roman copy of Greek original (c.380-360 BC)]]

=== Etymology ===
The term philosophy is taken from the Greek word, (phylos) meaning &quot;to love&quot; or &quot;to befriend&quot; and , (sophie) meaning &quot;wisdom.&quot;  Thus, &quot;philosophy&quot; means &quot;the love of wisdom&quot;. Socrates, a Greek philosopher, used the term philosophy as an equivalent to the ''search for wisdom''. Also, the term '''wisdom''' is used as a general term for describing the intellectual probing of any idea.

===Introduction to Philosophy===
The study of any discipline, such as Philosophy, should begin with its definition. But one of the characteristics of philosophy is that definitions are difficult, not just the definition of philosophy, but the definition of anything.  

To return to the definition of philosophy, in the Phaedo. Socrates says that philosophy is a preparation for the death that awaits us all.  When our minds are engaged in philosophy they escape earthly concerns and dwell in the region of ideas.  Our minds enter a spiritual region transcending the death of our corpus.  Another, better known, view of Socrates is that of philosophy as ‘the love of wisdom’.  This love discovers truth, and we become wise by practical application in our daily lives of what has been discovered.

These definitions highlight the nature of philosophical inquiry. Philosophers ask questions. These questions try to understand the metaphysical and physical world of man.

=== Pre-Socratics ===
The history of philosophy in the west begins with the Greeks, and particularly with a group of philosophers commonly called the pre-Socratics. This is not to deny the occurrence of other pre-philosophical rumblings in Egyptian and Babylonian cultures. Certainly great thinkers and writers existed in each of these cultures, and we have evidence that some of the earliest Greek philosophers may have had contact with at least some of the products of Egyptian and Babylonian thought. However, the early Greek thinkers added at least one element which differentiates their thoughts from all those who came before them. For the first time in history, we discover in their writings something more than dogmatic assertions about the ordering of the world -- we find reasoned arguments for various beliefs about the world.

==== Thales ====
Thales (in Greek: Θαλης) of Miletus (circa 624 BC - 546 BC), also known as Thales the Milesian, was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. Many regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition. He has also been traditionally considered the father of science, although it is also contended that the beginnings of science may be traced to Ancient Egypt.

===== Life =====

Thales lived in the city of Miletus, in Ionia, now western Turkey. According to Herodotus, he was of Phoenician descent.

The well-traveled Ionians had many dealings with Egypt and Babylon; Thales may have studied in Egypt as a young man. In any event, Thales almost certainly had exposure to Egyptian mythology, astronomy, and mathematics, as well as to other traditions alien to the Homeric traditions of Greece. Perhaps because of this, his inquiries into the nature of things extend beyond traditional mythology.

Several anecdotes suggest that Thales was not solely a thinker; he was involved in business and politics. One story recounts that he bought all the olive presses in Miletus after predicting the weather and a good harvest for a particular year. Another version of this same story states that he bought the presses to demonstrate to his fellow Milesians that he could use his intelligence to enrich himself. Herodotus recorded that Thales advised the city-states of Ionia to form a federation.

Thales is said to have died in his seat, while watching an athletic contest.

===== Theories and influence =====

Before Thales, the Greeks explained the origin and nature of the world through myths of anthropomorphic gods and heroes. Phenomena like lightning or earthquakes were attributed to actions of the gods.

By contrast, Thales attempted to find naturalistic explanations of the world, without reference to the supernatural. He explained earthquakes by imagining that the Earth floats on water and that earthquakes occur when the Earth is rocked by waves. Herodotus cites him as having predicted the solar eclipse of 585 BC that put an end to the fighting between the Lydians and the Medes.

Thales's most famous belief was his cosmological doctrine, which held that the world originated from water. It is sometimes assumed that Thales considered everything to be made from water. According to others, however, it's likely that while Thales saw water as an origin, he never pondered whether water continued to be the substance of the world.

Many philosophers followed Thales's lead in searching for explanations in nature rather than in the supernatural; others returned to supernatural explanations, but couched them in the language of philosophy rather than myth or religion.

Thales is credited for having first popularized Geometry to ancient Greek culture, mainly that of spatial relationships.

The best explanation of Thales's view is the following passage from [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]]'s ''[[w:Metaphysics|Metaphysics]]'' (983 BC). The passage is given in translation with key phrases transliterated from the Greek for the reader's benefit. The reader will see in the transliteration words from the theory of matter and form that were adopted by science with quite different meanings. The translation is somewhat literal, for purposes of accuracy.
:&quot;That from which is everything that exists (ta onta) and from which it first becomes (ex hou gignetai protou) and into which it is rendered at last (eis ho phtheiretai teleutaion), its substance remaining under it (tes men ousias hypomenouses), but transforming in qualities (pathesi metaballouses), that they say is the element (stoicheion) and principle (archen) of things that are (ton onton).&quot;

And again:

:&quot;For it is necessary (dei) that there be some nature (physin), either one or more than one, from which become (gignetai) the other things (t'alla) of the object being preserved (sozomenes ekeines)... Thales says that it is water (hydor).&quot;

Aristotle's depiction of the change problem and the definition of substance could not be more clear. If an object changes, is it the same or different? In either case how can there be a change (metabollein) from one to the other? The answer is the substance (ousia or physis), which &quot;is saved&quot;, but acquires or loses different qualities (pathe, the things you &quot;experience&quot;).

A deeper dip into the waters of the theory of matter and form is properly reserved to other articles. The question for this article is, how far does Aristotle reflect Thales? He was probably not far off, and Thales was probably an incipient matter-and-formist.

The essentially non-philosophic DL states that Thales taught as follows:
:&quot;Water constituted (hypestesato, &quot;stood under&quot;) the principle of all things.&quot;
[[w:Heraclitus Homericus|Heraclitus Homericus]] (Quaes. Hom. 22, not the same as Heraclitus of Ephesus) states that Thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance (hygra physis) turn into air, slime and earth. It seems clear that Thales viewed the Earth as solidifying from the water on which it floated and which surrounded it as Ocean.

Thales applied his method to objects that changed to become other objects, such as water into earth (he thought). But what about the changing itself? Thales did address the topic, approaching it through magnets and amber--which, when electrified by rubbing, attracts in the same way.

How was the power to move other things without the mover’s changing to be explained? Thales saw a commonality with the powers of living things to act. The magnet and the amber must be alive, and if that were so, there could be no difference between the living and the dead. When asked why he didn’t die if there was no difference, he replied “because there is no difference.”

Aristotle defined the soul as the principle of life, that which permeates the matter and makes it live, giving it the animation, or power to act. The idea did not originate with him, as the Greeks in general believed in the distinction between mind and matter, which was ultimately to lead to a distinction not only between body and soul but also between matter and energy.

If things were alive, they must have souls. This belief was no innovation, as the ordinary ancient populations of the Mediterranean did believe that natural actions were caused by divinities. Accordingly, the sources say that Thales believed all things possessed divinities. In their zeal to make him the first in everything they said he was the first to hold the belief, which even they must have known was not true.

However, Thales was looking for something more general, a universal substance of mind. That also was true to the polytheism of the times. Zeus was the very personification of supreme mind, dominating all the subordinate manifestations. From Thales on, however, philosophers had a tendency to depersonify or objectify mind, as though it were the substance of animation per se and not actually a god like the other gods. The end result was a total removal of mind from substance, opening the door to a non-divine principle of action. This tradition persisted until Einstein, whose cosmology is quite a different one and does not distinguish between matter and energy.

Classical thought, however, had proceded only a little way along that path. Instead of referring to the person, Zeus, they talked about the great mind:

:&quot;Thales&quot;, says Cicero, &quot;assures that water is the principle of all things; and that God is that Mind which shaped and created all things from water.&quot; (Cicero:&quot;De Nat.Deorum,&quot;i.,10.)

The universal mind appears as a Roman belief in Vergil as well:

:&quot;In the beginning, SPIRIT within strengthens Heaven and Earth,
:The watery fields, and the lucid globe of Lina, and then --
:Titan stars; and mind infused through the limbs
:Agitates the whole mass, and mixes itself with GREAT MATTER&quot;
:(Virgil: &quot;Aeneid,&quot; vi., 724 ff.)

=== Socrates ===
Socrates (c.470 – 399 BC) (Greek Σωκράτης Sōkrátēs) was a Greek (Athenian) philosopher.

Like Thales and the other pre-Socratics, Socrates too had the ambition to ask questions of life. However, where the pre-Socratics were more concerned with the cosmological questions, Socrates was concerned with questions of the following nature: What is piety? What kind of life is worthwhile for a human to live? Can virtue be taught? What is justice? Is there more than one's virtue? What is human excellence? 

Socrates did not actually write any of these ideas down. The only written information about his philosophy can be found in the dialogues of Plato and Xenophon. These dialogues deal mostly with questions of the good life, human excellence, and the cultivation of knowledge. One of Plato's most important and best known works is &quot;The Republic&quot; in which we find the allegory of The Cave that explains the difference between perceived reality and &quot;real&quot; reality which, according to Plato, can only be found in the realm of ideas.

{{recipesummary|Sandwich|1|5-10 minutes|1|Image=[[File:PBJ.png|300px]]}}
This sandwich should keep well because it has peanut butter on both pieces of bread, providing a waterproof layer to keep the bread from getting soggy. The downside is that one is more likely to get peanut butter into the jar of jam or jelly. Serve with a glass of milk.

==Ingredients (for 1 person)==
* 2 slices of [[Cookbook:White Bread|White Bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|Peanut Butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Jelly|Jelly]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|Jam]]

==Procedure==
#Using a spreading knife, spread an even coat of peanut butter on one side of each slice of bread.
#When the bread is evenly covered, spread an even coat of jelly atop the peanut butter.
#After applying the jelly, put one of the slices on a plate (jelly side up) and place the other slice on top of the first (jelly side down).

==Variations==
* Use whole wheat bread or an all-grain bread, whatever kind of bread you want.
* Add in some sliced banana.
* If using a crab apple jelly, a dash of cinnamon will nicely compliment the flavours of the sandwich.
* Replace the jelly with [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]].
* Replace the jelly with whipped cream cheese (a healthier fluffer-nutter) or keep the jelly and just add the cream cheese.
* Toast the bread before putting the peanut butter on it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Math is a wonderful discipline.  Too often though, mathematicians focus solely on theoretical mathematics, but this text can aid us in realizing the wonderful applications of math, and in this case calculus.  
---Professor M.

Although physics is often thought of as an &quot;applied mathematics&quot; class the relationship between physics and mathematics is far more interesting then just applying mathematics to the physical world. Often in the development of both physics and mathematics the innovations in one area drove new innovations in the other. One interesting example of this is the fact that when Newton wanted to test his theory of gravity he realized a major problem. His [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Gravity&amp;action=edit universal gravitational theory]] calculated the force between the two interacting objects as if all of the mass of the two objects could be treated as if it was concentrated at a point at the center of the object. Newton was faced with a serious problem. How could he prove that all of the mass of an extended object could be truely considered to be at a point at the center of the object? This required a new kind of mathematics and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus integral calculus] was invented. This illustrates the fact that often historically the motivation for developing mathematics was based on real problems. It is often not until later that all of the theoretical aspects of the mathematics are worked out. Although Newton is often credited with inventing the calculus, it is clear that he was very often more interested in developing mathematical models that would solve his scientific problems, then proving in a theoretical way his mathematical assumptions. It was left to others that followed to put the calculus on the same solid foundation that had been developed for geometry and other branches of mathematics.

Innovations in mathematics can often drive new discoveries in science too. An interesting example of this the study of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals fractals]. When they were first studied there was no practical use for them, but now physics and other sciences use them in the study of systems that are known to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory chaotic].

So why would a mathematician want to study physics? It seems that one very powerful answer to this question is that it helps one to see into the minds of many of the great thinkers of the past. What motivated them?  What where the challenges that they faced as they developed their ideas? and how they often turned to mathematics as the language to express their ideas and solve their problems. The study of mathematics strengthens the tools of the scientist and the study of science add fullness to our understanding of mathematics.

'Basic' grammar in Sanskrit may be an oxymoron, but here are some fundamentals.

Sanskrit is an inflected language, meaning that the nouns are declined and the verbs are conjugated. 

The Sanskrit language tends toward the subject-object-verb word ordering, but does allow for multiple type of sentence formulations particularly in the sutra form. 

There are three principal numbers used in the inflection of the Sanskrit language. These are singular, dual, and plural.
In declining Sanskrit nouns, there are eight cases used. These are nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, and locative. 

Nouns are declined according to their endings, with the exception of pronouns which have specific declensions.

The short ''a'' declension:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ''deva''-, god
! Singular
! Dual
! Plural
|-
! Nominative
| devas / devah
| devau
| devās / devaah
|-
! Accusative (Erg./Abs.)
| devam
| devau
| devān
|-
! Instrumental (Obl.+u9aI»)
| devena
| devābhyām
| devais / devaiih
|-
! Dative (Obl. + Un)
| devāya
| devābhyām
| devebhyas / devebhyah
|-
! Ablative (Obl)
| devāt
| devābhyām
| devebhyas / devebhyah
|-
! Genitive (Obl. + akh)
| devasya
| devayos / devayoh
| devānām
|-
! Locative
| deve
| devayos / devayoh
| deveṣu
|-
! Vocative
| hey deva
| hey devau
| hey devās / devaah
|}

*&lt;math&gt;\int cf(x)\,dx = c\int f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)+g(x)\,dx = \int f(x)\,dx+ \int g(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)-g(x)\,dx = \int f(x)\,dx- \int g(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int u\,dv\ = uv - \int v\,du&lt;/math&gt;

==Powers==
*&lt;math&gt;\int dx = x+C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int a\,dx = ax+C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int x^n\,dx = \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}+C\qquad\text{ if }n\ne-1&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{ax+b}\,dx = {1 \over a}\ln|ax+b|+C\qquad\text{ if }a\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Trigonometric Functions==

===Basic Trigonometric Functions===
*&lt;math&gt;\int \sin{x}\,dx = -\cos{x} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \cos{x}\,dx = \sin{x} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \tan{x}\,dx = \ln \left |{\sec{x}} \right | + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \sin^2{x}\,dx = \tfrac{1}{2} x - \tfrac{1}{4} \sin{2x} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^2{x}\,dx = \tfrac{1}{2} x + \tfrac{1}{4} \sin{2x} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \tan^2{x}\,dx = \tan(x) - x + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int\sin^n x\,dx = -\frac{\sin^{n-1} x\cos x}{n} + \frac{n-1}{n}\int\sin^{n-2} x\,dx+C \qquad\text{(for }n&gt;0\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\int\cos^n x\,dx = -\frac{\cos^{n-1} x\sin x}{n} + \frac{n-1}{n}\int\cos^{n-2} x\,dx+C \qquad\text{(for }n&gt;0\text{)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\int\tan^n x\,dx = \frac{1}{(n-1)}\tan^{n-1} x-\int\tan^{n-2} x\,dx+C \qquad\text{(for }n\neq 1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions===

*&lt;math&gt;\int \sec{x}\,dx = \ln \left |{\sec{x}}+\tan x \right | + C = \ln \left | \tan{\left( \frac1 2 x +\frac1 4 \pi \right) }\right |+C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \csc{x}\,dx = - \ln \left |{\csc x + \cot x} \right | + C=\ln \left | \tan \left(\frac1 2 x \right) \right |+C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \cot{x}\,dx = \ln \left |{\sin{x}} \right | + C&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\int \sec^2 kx\,dx = \frac1 k \tan{kx} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \csc^2 kx\,dx = -\frac1 k \cot kx + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \cot^2 kx\,dx = -x-\frac1 k \cot kx + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \sec{x}\tan{x}\,dx = \sec x + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \sec x \csc x\,dx =\ln \left | \tan x \right | + C&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\int \sec^n{x}\,dx = \frac{\sec^{n-1}{x} \sin {x}}{n-1} + \frac{n-2}{n-1}\int \sec^{n-2}{x}\,dx+C \qquad \text{ (for }n \ne 1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\int \csc^n{x}\,dx = -\frac{\csc^{n-1}{x} \cos{x}}{n-1} + \frac{n-2}{n-1}\int \csc^{n-2}{x}\,dx+C \qquad \text{ (for }n \ne 1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;\int\cot^n x\,dx = -\frac{1}{n-1}\cot^{n-1} x - \int\cot^{n-2} x\,dx+C \qquad\text{(for }n\neq 1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse Trigonometric Functions===

*&lt;math&gt;\int {1\over \sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx = \arcsin (x) + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int {1\over \sqrt{a^2-x^2}}\,dx = \arcsin (x/a) + C \qquad\text{ if }a\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int {1\over 1+x^2}\,dx = \arctan (x) + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int {1\over a^2+x^2}\,dx = {1\over a}\arctan (x/a) + C \qquad\text{ if }a\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Exponential and Logarithmic Functions==
*&lt;math&gt;\int e^x \,dx = e^x + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int e^{ax} \,dx = {1\over a}e^{ax} + C \qquad\text{ if }a\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int a^x \,dx = {1\over \ln a}a^x + C \qquad\text{ if }a&gt;0, a\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \ln x \,dx = x\ln x-x + C&lt;/math&gt;

==Inverse Trigonometric Functions==
*&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin (x) \,dx = x \arcsin (x) + \sqrt{1-x^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \arccos (x) \,dx = x \arccos (x) - \sqrt{1-x^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\int \arctan (x) \,dx = x \arctan (x) - {1\over 2}\ln(1+x^2) + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
== Dialogue 5==
'''Ricardo''': Bom dia. Quero comprar uma camisa. &lt;br&gt;
'''Carla''': Sim, certamente. As roupas estão ali.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Obrigado. Quero uma camisa branca.&lt;br&gt;
'''Carla''': O senhor quer também uma camisa preta?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Não. Mas quero um chapéu&lt;br&gt;
'''Carla''': Certamente. Obrigada.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Here, Ricardo is in a clothes shop. He asks the attendant, Carla, if he can have a white shirt - '''uma camisa branca'''.
He also asks for something else - '''um chapéu'''. This means &quot;a hat&quot;. We've come across the words for &quot;a&quot;. These are called, properly, &quot;indefinite articles&quot; (as opposed to the words for &quot;the&quot;, which are called &quot;definite articles&quot;). This is because the word &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; is ''indefinite'' - it doesn't specify which shirt or hat. Let's have a look at this table.

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 434px;&quot;
 border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f4f6d8&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;'''A/AN'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f4f6d8&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;'''A/AN'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f4f6d8&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;'''SOME'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f4f6d8&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;'''SOME'''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td
 align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#b4c8b4&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;''Masculine''&lt;br&gt;''singular''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#b4c8b4&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;''Feminine''&lt;br&gt;''singular''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#b4c8b4&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;''Masculine''&lt;br&gt;''plural''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#b4c8b4&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;''Feminine''&lt;br&gt;''plural''&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;'''um'''&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;'''uma'''&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;'''uns'''&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;'''umas'''&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Some examples? Sure. 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''o gato e um gato''' - the cat and a cat

'''os pêssegos e uns pêssegos''' - the peaches and some peaches

'''a casa e uma casa''' - the house and a house

'''as árvores e umas árvores''' - the tree and some trees
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Quickly, what does that '''e''' mean by itself? Simple - '''e''' means &quot;and&quot;. Let's have some practice.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

'''Convert the following from &quot;the&quot; to &quot;a&quot; or &quot;some'''

1. Os sapatos    =    ______ sapatos   (some/the shoe)

2. As gravatas   =    ______ _________ (the/some ties)

3. A saia        =    ______ _________ (a/the skirt)

4. O chapéu      =    ______ _________ (the/a hat)


'''Answers'''

1. uns

2. umas

3. uma

4. um
&lt;/table&gt;

Another major word we need to get to know is '''Quero'''. This word means &quot;I want&quot;. Of course, there are other conjugations...

'''Você quer alguma coisa?''' - Do you want something? '''Sim, quero uma camisa branca.''' - Yes, I want a white shirt.

'''O senhor quer também uma camisa preta?'''

'''Também''' means quite simply &quot;also&quot;. So we have &quot;Do you want also a black shirt?&quot;. But what on earth is this phrase, '''o senhor'''? Well, we've already learnt that '''você''' is more polite than '''tu'''. However, there is another level of politeness used in Portuguese. This form of &quot;you&quot; is used with people you don't know well, or people you have to show respect to, like bosses or teachers. Basically, this form allows you to refer to people ''indirectly''. So rather than address someone directly by name or with a pronoun such as &quot;você&quot;, you address them as if you were addressing a third person, &quot;o senhor&quot; (&quot;the gentleman&quot;) or &quot;a senhora&quot; (&quot;the lady&quot;). This added distance makes the speech more polite. Take note, however, that this form of &quot;you&quot; changes according to the gender of the person you're talking to, plus how many people you are talking to as well!

Have a look at the table below...

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 903px;&quot;
border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e2e2e2&quot;
width=&quot;165&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;o senhor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;talking to only one male &lt;br&gt;(equivalent to &quot;Mr&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#d4dcc2&quot;
width=&quot;178&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;a senhora&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;talking to only one married female &lt;br&gt;(equivalent to &quot;Mrs&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#d4dcc2&quot;
width=&quot;165&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;a menina&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;talking to only one unmarried female &lt;br&gt;(equivalent to &quot;Miss&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e2e2e2&quot;
width=&quot;306&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;os senhores&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;talking to more than one male or a mixed group&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#d4dcc2&quot; width=&quot;218&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;as senhoras&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;talking to more than one married female&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#d4dcc2&quot;
width=&quot;178&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;as meninas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;talking to more than one unmarried female&lt;/td&gt;

The operator '''/=''' compares two values on inequality. It is predefined for all non [[Ada Programming/Types/limited|limited types]]. The operator will also be defined if a suitable [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/=|operator =]] is available.

Note that in Ada the representation for this operator was chosen for resembling the mathematical symbol &lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt;, in the same way than &lt;= resembles &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;, or &gt;= resembles &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Shreshth91. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Shreshth91~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

''The idea of this book is to couple together the different projects on the different subjects of software engineering. Currently the only book linked is [[Computer Programming]]. Other subjects should be added over time.''

As written in the [[Computer Programming]] book, coding is only a small part of software engineering. This book is intended as an introduction to the realm of software engineering. 

=The Basics=

==What is software engineering?==
A systematic approach to the analysis,
design, implementation and maintenance of software.

Software engineering is the engineering discipline through which software is developed. Commonly the process involves finding out what the client wants, composing this in a list of requirements, designing an architecture capable of supporting all of the requirements, designing, coding, testing and integrating the separate parts, testing the whole, deploying and maintaining the software. Programming is only a small part of software engineering.

The discipline is still in its infancy (early stage of growth/development) as an engineering discipline. We haven't had enough experience, nor gathered enough empirical data to systematically understand and predict the life-cycle of a software project.

The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge ([http://www.swebok.org/ SWEBOK]) divides software engineering into 10 knowledge areas:

# Software requirements
# Software design
# [[Computer Programming|Software construction]]
# Software testing
# Software maintenance
# Software configuration management
# Software engineering management
# Software engineering process
# Software engineering tools and methods
# Software quality

=The content of the field=
''Note: the following summaries are originally from Wikipedia. These are here only temporarily. The titles aren't final, nothing on this page is final yet (or even near final).''

==Vision and Scope==
The practice of software engineering in the corporate or industrial sector, starts with the business and ends with the business. Although computers, programming languages, and creative problem solving are what fill the engineer with interest in the field, without servicing and enabling the user, the exercise would be pointless. Thus the first stage in any software engineering process, is the [[/Vision and Scope/]] document, or some equivalent meeting.

A vision of the system to be built is described by the user or [[/Product Champion/]]. The business context that it will service is described. The key stakeholders are enumerated including their interests, risks, etc. The success conditions are listed, so that it is understood what will be completed and how to measure success. 

Business opportunities are discussed, to justify why the project should be invested with the blood, sweat, and tears of programmers, testers, project managers, and program managers. The Scope of the project is made clear and if it is to be in phases, the scope of each phase at a high level is laid out. The priorities of the project are recorded.

With an understanding of the business' vision, the engineers begin to ask questions.

==Requirements Analysis==
Extracting requirements of a desired software product is the first task in creating it. This process is called requirements elicitation. While customers probably believe they know what the software should do, it may require skill and experience in software engineering to recognize incomplete, ambiguous or contradictory requirements.

Compounding this problem is the absence of formal abstractions. A civil, mechanical engineer has a plan, elevation, sections to refer to and these make good sense to both the author and reader of these abstractions. However, while (E-R) or object diagrams, process flow diagrams, data flow diagrams are abstractions that have been used and built on, many of these are not universally used or practiced.

Besides, considerable effort goes into repairing and enhancing existing systems. Engineering required here is a mix of reverse and forward engineering in the sense that requirements definitions refer to a set of circumstances that already exist and these circumstances have to be stated in unambiguous terms as well.

Perhaps, lack of universally accepted abstractions make life difficult for software engineers and some people have even argued that software production process is closer to art rather than engineering!

Of late, people have started using prototypes in various degrees of working. Screen shots and report layouts are non working prototypes and form the basic level of prototyping and increasing sophistication is built in wherever possible. Making prototypes is always more time consuming than not making one. Thus, this practice is not always utilised.

===Analyst Role===
The role of analyst can be fulfilled typically by three types of people. A technical project manager, a software engineer, or a dedicated analyst. In some organizations it is unthinkable to engineers that they would serve the analyst role, as they are &quot;technical&quot; and would consider dealing directly with the customer unthinkable. This is purely a cultural stance that varies between companies and organizations. It is also quite common for software engineers to work closely with the business people and customers associated with a project, and this programmer/analyst role can be quite beneficial to the projects success rate.

As you are gathering requirements, you can subject them to analysis. Does the requirement in question conflict with others? What is its priority? Where did it come from? Does it need further clarification?

Analysis is ability to draw inferences from requirements and represent them in a structured way. Structures themselves may vary based on what is being analysed. It is very tough to draw boundaries between analysis and requirements gathering as they both use the same abstractions many a time.

One could argue that analysis yields data storage structures and workflow structures etc. However, one would think that these are not the only outputs from analysis.

==Communication Techniques==
The common technique that means the software requirement analysis begins with communication between two or more parties.
Review of a software requirement specification is conducted by both software developer and
customer. Because the specification forms the foundation for design and subsequent software
engineering activities, extreme care should be taken in conducting the review.
The review is first conducted at a macroscopic level. At this level, the reviewers attempt to
ensure that the specification is complete, consistent and accurate. Once the review is
complete a software requirement specification is signed off, “by both customers and developer”.
===Case Study===
While requirement analysis phase some problems are come. The problems are identified and defined and listed here.
• The problem occurs that did exist in smaller systems, which leads to a redefining of priority of the activities that go into developing software. 
• In the beginning of the requirements phase, the needs of clients are in the minds of various people in the client organization. 
• The major role of the problem statement is that the customer has a problem that may be responsible to a computer-based solution. A developer responds to the customer’s request for help. Here the one more problem is the path from communication to understanding is often full of difficulties.
===Suggestions===
The above case study/problem determined while requirement analyzing phase in &quot;system 
engineering&quot;. This page can be improved soon.

==Use Cases==
Once the vision and scope of a engineering project has been established the requirements gather process begins. One tool for communicating between the customer, analyst, developers, and testers is a set of Use Cases. A Use Case typically has a name, a short description, and then a number set of steps which a user would go through to accomplish a task. Use cases are sometimes grouped together in a UML or other format of diagram depicting users, the system, external entity and specific use cases.

===Granularity===
Use Cases are typically coarse-grained and don't dive into every detail and functional requirement of the system. A business person or software engineer should be able to read through all of the use cases and get an idea of the entire scope of what the project will deliver. 

===Formality of Use Cases===
Agile driven projects may skip these cases, or at least only record the attributes discussed above. Plan driven methodologies may give additional attributes to Use Cases such as alternative paths after covering the main steps, trace requirements covered by the use case back to their source, and have an error handling section for each use case.

THE STAGES OF ANALYSIS

Analysis is typically accomplished in two stages.  The first stage, Business Analysis includes an in-depth examination of the customer's present set of business or manufacturing processes and procedures with an eye toward how they might be improved by automation.  The second stage, Systems Analysis consists of an examination of the proposed improvements and a recommendation on what computer environment and software technology is best suited to accomplish those improvements.

BUSINESS ANALYSIS STAGE

From the Business Analyst's in-depth understanding of the customer's present environment, he or she creates a set of &quot;business use-cases&quot;, which are short descriptions of the role that each of the business's &quot;actors&quot; perform within each process or procedure.  For instance, the waiter in a restaurant might have a use case as follows:  &quot; A. Actor approaches customer table, introduces self and recites a description of the day's specials.  B. Actor presents a beverage menu and inquires if customer would like to order a beverage.  C. If yes, actor writes each customer's order on a drink tag and proceeds to bar area.  D. Actor presents the tag to bar-keep and makes a mental note to check back within a customary time to see if the drink order is complete.  E. If no, Actor presents a dinner menu and helps customers to make selections.  As each new party of customers is seated, actor repeats procedure, beginning from step A.&quot;  With a set of raw use-cases like the proceeding, the business analyst can, with the customer's collaboration, examine how each use-case might be automated and can thereby define an official system requirement which becomes one of maybe hundreds of requirements that define the future software application.  As might be surmised, the effective Business Analyst must not only have extensive experience with and knowledge of the business world, but must also have expertise in the potentialities offered by modern software systems and how those systems map to the reality of the business world.

SYSTEMS ANALYSIS STAGE

The second stage of the analysis process, Systems Analysis begins from the foundation laid by the business analyst.  From the set of business use cases and their resultant software requirements, the Systems Analyst makes recommendations as to the most suitable software technology to accomplish those requirements.  In some cases, the hardware environment limits choices of software technologies. For instance, in the restaurant scenario, above.  The customer might be adamant about providing the waiter with a handheld device to replace the drink tag and to make the trip to the bar unnecessary before the drink order is ready to serve.  In such a case, the systems analyst might be constrained to using only those operating systems and APIs that are supported on the preferred handheld device.

Once the programming and run-time environment is decided, then the systems analyst can begin turning the business use-cases and requirements into a set of &quot;system use-cases,&quot; which are descriptions of how the actors will interact with the proposed system.  Those system use-cases, taken together now comprise the actual blueprint that will be used by software architects to begin laying out the classes or other software modules that will define a road map for the software coding and development process which follows.

==Specification==
Specification is the task of precisely describing the software to be written, in a mathematically rigorous way. In reality, most successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed. Specifications are the most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.

==Requirements Management==
Once you have gathered requirements, captured them into a specification, and the customer agrees with it, it is possible to take a snapshot or baseline of the project requirements. This allows one to manage existing requirements and process new incoming ones. The specification is placed under configuration management, such as a tool like CVS so that the requirements can be versioned and tracked.

===Rejecting Requirements===
It is important to reject requirements that
* Don't fit within the project scope
* Cannot show a positive return on investment
* Won't make the system competitive
* Aren't technically feasible

A requirement rejected doesn't have to be further analyzed, implemented, documented, or tested. Every requirement costs the company and must be thought through.

===Change Control===
Regardless of whether your methodology is agile or plan driven, you should create some form of change control to process new requirements. Failure to do so may lead to project failure due to scope creep, project overruns, poor quality, or high costs. Change control can be as simple as a development manager reviewing specification, to an elaborate tool supported process with forms and a board of people with change control authority.

Lack of communication about changes to a specification can lead to costly wasted work by developers, testers, or analysts. The time it takes to change one requirement in a specification, may cost 100 times the person hours to realize the decision.

==Design and Architecture==
Design and architecture are the activities involved in specifying how the software will actually work.  This phase frequently described as being divided into two main phases, which might be described as &quot;business design&quot; and &quot;technical design&quot;.  Business design generally specifies the &quot;why&quot; of the system, indicating how data will be used and how it will flow.  Technical design generally specifies the &quot;how&quot; of the system, or how its components will be arranged, what their features will be, and what kind of hardware the system will require.  These two phases can often be conducted roughly simultaneously, with business design usually starting first and technical design ending last.

Of all of the phases, the design phase can often consume the most time, and many engineers consider it the most important.  A poor design can cause the failure of a project, even after considerable resources are spent during the construction phase of the project building it.  It is important for the design and architecture of the system to be complete enough that it can be validated and then used to develop the system.

==Coding==
Reducing a design to code may be the most obvious part of the software engineering process, but it is not necessarily the largest portion.  In fact, many software engineers only work on the analysis and design process, then the coding work is handed off to computer programmers to implement.  This trend is increasing in many companies, where software engineers are hired domestically and the implementation is out-sourced to a country where programming labor is less expensive.  In spite of this trend, many software engineers still go through the entire process and do coding as well as design.

[[Computer_Programming|Coding Wikibook]]

==Testing==
The purpose of testing is not only to prove that the code performs in accordance with the design specifications, but to prove that it does not fail when subjected to undefined inputs.

There are several types of testing. '''Unit testing''' tests one module of code for correct inputs, outputs, and functionality. '''System testing''' tests all the modules of a software system together. '''User acceptance testing''' is a form of systems testing to see if not only the system works, but it meets the requirements of the business user.  '''Regression testing''' is testing performed after a system change to make sure that all system features are still present after the change. 

To perform systems and verifications testing, '''Use cases''' are developed.  These cases describe a user action or a specific feature of the system.  These cases are very useful during the construction phase of the system, and are usually specified as a deliverable of the design phase.  The use cases are generally gathered into ''test scripts'' which describe testing activities in a reproducible way.  These scripts may be executed manually by testers, or they may be executed by automated testing software.

Generally speaking, it is an accepted industry practice for system testing and validation to be performed by a separate person, team, or department, or in some cases, by an outside entity.  Testing is considered a specialized skill, with a skill set that is very different from system development.  It also is generally considered a bad practice for software developers to test their own systems, since they can form habits that do not exercise the system thoroughly, and because they can frequently test around system failures.

There are different kinds of testing such as white box testing or black box testing.

==Documentation==
An important (and often overlooked) task is documenting the internal design and external functionality of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement. 

[[w:Software_documentation|Software documentation]] is important.  Without documentation, software can be unusable, because the end user does not know how to operate a program. Without documentation, an application can be incorrectly installed on a server, causing components to fail.  Documentation is most important for external interfaces. 

There are several means by which software can be documented, including flowcharts, deployment guides, user's manuals, and maintenance manuals. 

Development team members may write their own documentation, or a professional technical writer may write or edit the documents for readability and style.

It's important to note that testing is or should be done during or at the end of every stage. If this is not done, inputs into the next stage can not be very complete. Documentation may also be sketchy or none existent.

==Maintenance==
Maintaining and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered problems or new requirements can take far more time than the initial development of the software. Not only may it be necessary to add code that does not fit the original design but just determining how software works at some point after it is completed may require significant effort by a software engineer. About 2/3 of all software engineering work is maintenance, but this statistic can be misleading. A small part of that is fixing bugs. Most maintenance is extending systems to do new things, which in many ways can be considered new work. Similarly, about 2/3 of all civil engineering, architecture, and construction work is maintenance in a similar way.

=Applied Software Engineering=
The process of software engineering differs between different software types. Building a word processor has different requirements and design methods than building a 3D first person shooter. These sections cover the differences and unique properties of the different software types.

==SE on Application software==

==SE on Server Software==
Software engineering for server software is more complex then development for the desktop computers. A server is more complex, has more requirements and features than an ordinary, consumer system. Server software can have client-server as well as central architecture. Development and testing of server software is also different from the development and testing of the desktop software. Not every programming language is suitable for implementation of server software. In conclusion, SE on server software requires special methods and processes to successfully complete.

The main reason server software is more complex is that communication between 2 computers -- the server and the client -- is inherently more complex and prone to failure than communication between parts of a program running on a single computer.

==SE on Simulations==

===Scientific and engineering simulations===

===Games===
Designing software for gaming simulations can be quite challenging, since it requires a diverse background in software.  For example, a game designer might have to write software that simulates physics as well as software that renders 3-dimensional images.  However, many software engineers in the gaming industry are able to use 3rd party engines that make their job much easier.  Nonetheless, they must follow the software engineering process closely, since small issues in the software can make the product fail in the consumer market.  Writing software for games is a high-risk industry and only a small percentage of games are financially successful.

==SE on Embedded software==
Software engineers that work with embedded computer systems need more knowledge of hardware than most software engineers, since embedded systems typically introduce more constraints on memory availability and processing power than, say, gaming PCs.  Designing software for embedded systems can indeed be challenging, since most embedded processors cannot handle the overhead produced by compiling high-level languages.  This often forces software engineers to implement embedded software, at least partially, in assembly.

== Waterfall model? ==

The sections here are set up in a very traditional way, kind of implicitly supporting the waterfall model: spec, design, implement, test, etc.

It would be good I think to balance this out with some info on agile programming techniques.  It isn't just a fad, real companies are developing real software this way...--[[User:Kenlars99|Kenlars99]] 21:33, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

--[[User:Kenlars99|Kenlars99]] 21:33, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

Actually the layout supports multiple models. For example the spiral model uses spec, design, impl. and test in small repeating iterations. Ofcourse the layout may be changed to better represent what these steps (specification, design, ...) are and how they are employed in differend development models. You're more than welcome to propose a better layout as I'm not an expert in the material.&lt;BR&gt;
The many models (functional, OO, agile, extreme programming) should get a clear treatment and compared to each other, not so much as to say which is the best, but more to explain where they are best used. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 20:14, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

== Test cases ==

I have had a list of common test cases transwikied from Wikipedia because I thought it could be put to good use in this or a similar book.  The list can be found at [[Transwiki:Common Test Cases]].  It needs a little cleanup, of course, but is in pretty good shape.  Hopefully, someone for familiar with this book than me can put it to good use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What are Differential Equations? ==
The term ''differential equation'' was coined by Leibniz in 1676 for a relationship between the two differentials ''dx'' and ''dy'' for the two variables ''x'' and ''y''.{{fact}}

However, soon after the first usage of this term, differential equations quickly became understood as any algebraic or transcendental equation which involved derivatives.

An '''ordinary differential equation''' is a relationship between a real variable, (let us say ''x''), a dependent variable (let us call this ''y''), and (possibly many) derivatives of the dependent variable ''y'' with respect to ''x''. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;xy\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+y\frac{dy}{dx}+e^{3x}=0&lt;/math&gt;

is an ordinary differential equation.

A '''partial differential equation''' is a relationship between a function of several variables, the partial derivatives of that function, and the independent variables. Usually they are much more difficult to deal with than ordinary differential equations.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}(x,y)+x^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}(x,y)=0&lt;/math&gt;

is an example of a partial differential equation.

=== Objectives ===
When given a ordinary differential equations problem, the objective is typically to find all functions ''y''(''x''), so that this function and its derivatives satisfy the relationship specified by the equation. In other words if you plug the function into the equation you arrive at an equality.  Explicitly finding such functions in terms of functions we already know is frequently not possible.  When it is possible it may involve creative mathematical techniques.  However many standard techniques exist for some of the more common types of ordinary differential equation and they will be explained in this Wikibook.  In cases where explicit solutions do not exist, one is left to investigate properties of the function that may be deduced entirely from the equation.  Examples of such questions might be
*&quot;Do solutions exist at all?&quot;
*&quot;Is there just one solution, or many, and can they be classified?&quot; 
*&quot;How can we approximate a solution numerically?&quot;
*&quot;What is the asymptotic behavior of a solution&quot;? (That is how does it behave as, say ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞).
The subject of differential equations is built upon the subject of calculus.  The reader is expected to be familiar with Multivariable calculus, though for the vast majority of topics discussed knowledge of single variable calculus will suffice.  Particularly when systems of ordinary differential equations are discussed it will also be necessary to assume the reader is familiar with linear algebra.  Though for much of the book this will also not be necessary to read the sections.

===Why are they useful?===

Differential equations occur frequently in many branches of science and in both pure and applied mathematics.  One possible explanation for this is to remember that a derivative describes a rate of change, so anytime it is useful to describe how changes in one thing depend on changes in some other thing, differential equations are lurking in the background (or possibly foreground!).  Differential equations allow us to model changing patterns in both physical and mathematical problems.

===When can they occur?===

Differential equations (DEs) often occur in systems when one variable is related to the rate of change of another, or vice versa. For example, the water level in a bucket with a hole in it being filled by a steady flow of water can be described by differential equations, as the rate of flow of water out of the bucket is proportional to the depth of the water.

In general, DEs may be formed from a consideration of the physical properties to which they refer. Often they occur when arbitrary constants are eliminated from a function. For example, suppose

:&lt;math&gt;y(x)=a \sin x +b \cos x, \,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''a'' and ''b'' being arbitrary constants. Differentiating this function twice (with respect to ''x'') gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=-a \sin x-b \cos x, &lt;/math&gt;

which is equal to the negative variant of the original equation. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -y. &lt;/math&gt;

You may have noticed that the example involved the second derivative, which brings us to an important concept. The order of a differential equation is defined as the highest derivative order involved in the equation. This will be explained more fully later.

==What should I already know to use this book?==

[[Calculus]] is an absolute must.  If you don't know how to do derivatives and integrals, you will not be able to follow this book.  A basic understanding of [[trigonometry]] (mainly for [[w:Identity_(mathematics)|identities]] to clean up answers and perform mathematical 'backflips' to make the problem more easily solvable) and complex numbers will also help.  If you don't remember all your trig identities, don't worry &amp;mdash; when I use a non-basic one for the first time, I will explain it.  For the systems sections, a basic understanding of vectors and matrices is needed. The ability to multiply matrices and solve normal systems of equations via matrices will suffice.

== Topics covered in this book ==

At current time, I plan on covering only ordinary differential equations, not partial differential equations.  I may add partials later, if I feel I am capable of writing the text.  Most of the time will be spent on linear differential equations.  By the end of this text, you should be capable of solving the vast majority of solvable linear systems.

== How to use this book ==

The book is divided into lessons, each lesson covering one topic.  Each lesson has four parts:

*Part 1 of the lesson explains the concept and states any theorems, proofs, and instructions needed. 
*Part 2 of the lesson is a set of real world uses for the technique &amp;mdash; I hate not knowing why something is useful just as much as you do. 
*Part 3 is a set of problems you can do for practice. 
*Part 4 is the answers, with work, for part 3.

I strongly suggest starting the book at Lesson 1 and moving on.  Each lesson builds on the last, and no time is given to the revision of previous topics.  If you are reading this to refresh your knowledge of differential equations, be sure you really do remember the concepts, and be prepared to go back if you don't.

== Conventions used in this book ==

Derivatives are specified in one of three ways, depending on what best suits this book's purpose:

*&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;y' \,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;y^{(3)} \,&lt;/math&gt; (mainly used for high order derivatives)

Important terms are put in '''bold''' the first time they are seen.  All of these terms can be found in the glossary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition &amp; Meaning ==
'''Philosophy''' is a broad field of [[w:knowledge|knowledge]] in which the definition of knowledge itself is one of the subjects investigated.  It spans the nature of the [[w:universe|universe]], the [[w:mind|mind]], and the [[w:body|body]]; the relationships between all three, and between people.  Philosophy is a field of inquiry &amp;ndash; the pursuit of wisdom; the predecessor and complement of [[w:science|science]], developing the issues which underlie science and pondering those questions which are beyond the scope of science.

== Using Philosophy ==
The essence of philosophy is the study and development of fundamental ideas and methods that are not adequately addressed in specialized [[w:empiricism|empirical]] disciplines, such as [[w:physics|physics]] or [[w:history|history]]. As such, philosophy provides the foundations upon which all belief structures and fields of knowledge are built.  It is responsible for the definitions of, and the approaches used to develop the theories of, such diverse fields as [[w:religion|religion]], [[w:language|language]], [[w:science|science]], [[w:law|law]], [[w:psychology|psychology]], [[w:mathematics|mathematics]], and [[w:politics|politics]].  It also examines and develops its own structure and procedures, and when it does so is called [[w:metaphilosophy|metaphilosophy]]: the ''philosophy of philosophy.''  

Philosophy has a rich literary heritage, including the writings and teachings &lt;!--Socrates, for instance, produced no writings.--&gt;of [[w:list of philosophers|profound thinkers]] from many cultures throughout history. Philosophers seek to understand the principles that underlie all [[w:knowledge|knowledge]] and [[w:being|being]]. For this purpose, they develop methods of thinking, including [[w:logic|logic]], [[w:introspection|introspection]], and [[w:meditation|meditation]]. Applying these methods, they investigate the most fundamental questions, such as &quot;What is the nature of the universe?&quot; ([[w:metaphysics|metaphysics]]), &quot;What do we [[w:knowledge|know]], and how do we know it?&quot; ([[w:epistemology|epistemology]]), &quot;What is the difference between [[w:goodness and value theory|good]] and [[w:evil|evil]]?&quot; ([[w:ethics|ethics]]), &quot;What is [[w:beauty|beauty]]?&quot; ([[w:aesthetics|aesthetics]]), and &quot;What is the [[w:meaning of life|meaning of life]]?&quot; ([[w:teleology|teleology]]).

== Philosophical Perspectives &amp; Traditions ==
'Philosophy' translates literally from the original Greek as 'love of wisdom'. 'What is philosophy', is itself a philosophical question. This is a clue to the nature of philosophy. It is very general in scope; so general that it, perhaps uniquely among the disciplines, includes itself in its scope. What is clear is that philosophy is, in some sense, thinking about thinking.

In the analytic tradition of Europe and its subsequent transplanting to the Americas, philosophy has reinvented itself with a new set of techniques that would be out of place in the world of the ancient Greeks, where philosophy started. It centres on logic and conceptual analysis. Topics at its centre include the theory of knowledge, ethics, the nature of language, and the nature of mind.

Earlier traditions of philosophy placed more emphasis on the study of the arts and science of life: a general theory and a commendation of way of life. In this sense, philosophy is concerned with the ''practical'' bits of ''how'' to live rather than a ''theoretical attempt to understand''. This legacy was derived from some of the earliest philosophers known to us: the Sophists, who were the teachers of rhetoric, grammar and science of the ancient world. Though somewhat akin to sages these Sophists played an important role in the development of philosophy.

In the subsequent analytic tradition that developed after the Sophists, philosophy became a subject you could pursue for purely abstract and metaphysical reasons. In the Sophist tradition, philosophy is a body of knowledge to be mastered with which you could gain power or reward. It is possible to exaggerate these differences for when philosophy is not dogma each tradition pays some homage to the other.

In the Western world, at one time the term 'philosophy' covered all disciplines. Over time, as the corpus of human knowledge grew, various disciplines emerged, each with their own methodologies and domains of study, and these disciplines became to a large extent autonomous. For example, if you go into a public library that uses the [[w:Dewey Decimal Classification | Dewey decimal classification system]], you will find that psychology books have a classmark starting with 150 - right in the middle of the philosophy section. This is because at the time the system was created, in the latter half of the 19th century, psychology was only just beginning to emerge as a distinct discipline. Another example is the term 'natural philosophy', which was once used to mean science, or more particularly physics. By this view, what is called 'philosophy' at any time in history are those provinces of human knowledge which have not yet come of age, which not yet developed their own autonomous character and status.

These independent disciplines do have their own philosophies; so there is a philosophy of science, a philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of psychology, and so on. When studying in these areas, one looks at methodological issues or examines some of the core concepts of the discipline, as well as various ethical issues.

There are domains which definitely belong in a philosophy department. Epistemology is concerned with 'how do I know what I know?', Ontology with 'what is real?', Ethics with 'how should one conduct oneself?'. Logic is concerned with proper reasoning. Many other disciplines exist within philosophy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorry, but this module should be totally redone. We have already determined the origins of philosophy and now we would like to discuss of how philosophy is studied. What happens in philosophy? We need to maintain fluid motion throughout this text.

== Suggested mere of content ==

There was another &quot;What is Philosophy&quot; page on Wikibooks that I'm deleting, but the content is so brief I am deciding to add it here instead:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bertrand Russell used the simple definition that Philosophy is speculation on subjects where definite information is not available. Thus in some areas, such as the physical nature of the world, knowledge has expanded greatly in such fields as Astronomy, Geology, Physics, and Chemistry, and these areas of study move out of the scope of philosophy; while in other areas, such as ethics, little or no progress has been made since ancient times and are still considered suitable for philosophical speculation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Add this content, ignore it, or whatever.  I'm throwing it here so there is a chance it might be used.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:22, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

== Philosophy as a discipline or an area of study ==

In modern anglo-american analytic philosophy, philosophy is a discipline. That is, there are rules about how to do it, tools and techniques that may be employed, etc. Other types of philosophy (perhaps Eastern Philosophy, Continental philosophy) may not be disciplines but areas of study (morality, virtue, government) when the student is not confined by established methods. 

This causes endless problems when the word &quot;philosophy&quot; is mentioned to laymen. 

It need to be made clear whether the subject of the book is a discipline or an area of study.[[User:Logicalgregory|Logicalgregory]] ([[User talk:Logicalgregory|talk]]) 09:03, 28 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
== Dialogue 6==
'''Ricardo''': O senhor pode me dizer a que horas parte o próximo comboio para o Porto?&lt;br&gt;
'''Alberto''': Às três horas. O senhor tem bilhete?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Não. Posso comprar um bilhete?&lt;br&gt;
'''Alberto''': Sim. Quer um bilhete de segunda classe?&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Sim. Quanto custa?&lt;br&gt;
'''Alberto''': Três euros.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': De que plataforma parte o comboio?&lt;br&gt;
'''Alberto''': Da plataforma três.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Here Ricardo is buying a ticket on a train station ('''o comboio''' in Portugal, &quot;the train&quot;, is translated as '''o trem''' in Brazil). He also asks some other questions about the train he wants to catch. In this lesson we're going to learn how to make questions in Portuguese. We've already seen one way of asking about things, when we looked at verbs like &quot;gostar&quot;.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Você gosta de Lisboa?''' - Do you like Lisbon?

'''O senhor gosta de viajar?''' - Do you like travelling?
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

These are almost exactly the same as stating something.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Você gosta do gato.''' - You like the cat.

'''A senhora gosta da amiga''' - You like the friend.
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In fact, the only difference between these sentences is that there is a question mark at the end. In Portuguese, you can ask a yes/no question by just stating something, and putting a question mark at the end of it. In the spoken language, you should pronounce with a raising entonation to the end of the sentence, just like in English. This is an extremely easy way to form a question.

&lt;big&gt; '''STATEMENT &amp; QUESTION MARK  =  YES/NO QUESTION''' &lt;/big&gt;

And how do we answer such questions? Well, of course, with a &quot;Yes&quot; or a &quot;No&quot;. When Alberto asks Ricardo:

'''O senhor tem bilhete?'''

Ricardo could answer with...

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 178px;&quot;
 border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dce1c5&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c6e1df&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;&gt;No&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td
 bgcolor=&quot;#dce1c5&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Sim&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c6e1df&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''N&amp;atilde;o'''&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We've also encountered another way to ask questions. Back in lesson three we learnt how to ask someone what they were going to do on a certain day. Do you remember?

'''O que vai fazer na terça-feira?''' - What are you going to do on Tuesday?

'''O que eles vão fazer no domingo?''' - What are they going to do on Sunday?

The two words 'O que' mean &quot;what?&quot; You can also ask &quot;o que é que...&quot;, which literally means &quot;what is it that...&quot;.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''O que é que ela quer comer?''' - What does she want to eat?

'''De que é que tu gostas?''' - What do you like?

(note that &quot;gostar&quot; must always be accompanied by &quot;de&quot; and you can never end a sentence with &quot;de&quot;)
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This is a guide on how to set up multiple mambo installations on one server with only one database.

==What is the ting?==

When one wants to set up multiple installations on one server, there are some issues to deal with. The first is the amount of storage on the server. One mambo installation requires at least 8MB, so if you have a small web hotel with only 15 megs, you have already met a definite limitation.

If you have enough storage space, though, it is the database that is the &quot;problem&quot;. It is not really a problem though, as there are workaround for this. If you have the option to have multiple databases with your web host, that is surely reccomended. This is very easy to manage, and easy to use. But, the most common feature is only one mysql database.

==The problem==

The problem is of course overlapping tables. A database consists of many tables, and each of these tables contain data. Mambo has tables like &quot;components&quot;, &quot;users&quot; and of course the &quot;content&quot; table. If you want to have two mambo installations on the same sql database, the problem occurs - the databases will overlap and overwrite each other!

==The solution==

Mambo has by default a setting called database prefix, that adds a prefix to all the tables. For instance, if the prefix is &quot;mos_&quot; (which is deafult in mambo - all tables will get this prefix unless otherwise is specified) and the table is named &quot;downloads&quot;, the table will in fact be named &quot;mos_downloads&quot;.

This prefix is specified during the installation of mambo. By default it is &quot;mos_&quot;, as mentioned above, and that is what you should use for your site. Then, when installing the second site - simply change the database prefix! This will ensure that no tables overlap, and that everything runs smoothly.</text>

While one of the first Wikibooks to achieve the &quot;100%&quot; rating, it has languished for some time and perhaps needs to be revisited.  There are some dead end spots, but at the same time it does show some signs of promise, if there would be a little bit of effort done to fix it up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This part of this section is about the where and when of the experience called consciousness. Is it in the world, in the brain or are the world and brain within it?''
==Phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness==

Block(1995) drew attention to the way that there appear to be two types of consciousness: ''phenomenal'' consciousness and ''access'' consciousness:

 Phenomenal consciousness is experience; the phenomenally
 conscious  aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that
 state. The mark of access-consciousness, by contrast, is 
 availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech 
 and action. (Block 1995). 

''See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_Nineteenth_and_twentieth_century_philosophy#Ned_Block_.281942-_.29 section on Ned Block's ideas] for a deeper coverage of his approach to access and phenomenal consciousness.''

Block uses Nagel's famous (1974) paper, &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot; as an exemplary description of phenomenal consciousness.  Excellent descriptions have also been proffered by the empiricist philosophers who gave lengthy descriptions of consciousness as partly  experience itself. Although Block has formalised the idea of phenomenal and access consciousness similar ideas have also been put forward by many philosophers including Kant and Whitehead. 

Access consciousness has two interpretations, in the first, used by Block, it applies to the functions that appear to operate on phenomenal consciousness. In the second, used by the behaviourists and eliminativists, it is some property of the functions of the brain that can be called 'consciousness'.  

This division between phenomenal and functional aspects of consciousness is useful because it emphasises the idea of phenomenal consciousness as observation rather than action. Some philosophers such as Huxley in 1874, have taken the view that because phenomenal consciousness appears to have no function it is of no importance or cannot exist.  James (1879) introduced the term &quot;epiphenomenalism&quot; to summarise the idea that consciousness has no function. 

The idea that phenomenal consciousness cannot exist is a type of ''Eliminativism'' (also known as Eliminative Materialism). Eliminativism owes much to the work of Sellars(1956) and Feyerbend (1963). Dennett (1978) applied Eliminativism to phenomenal consciousness and denies that pain is real. Others such as Rey(1997) have also applied eliminativism to phenomenal consciousness.

Dennett (1988) redefines consciousness in terms of access consciousness alone, he argues that &quot;Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties&quot;.  Having related all consciousness to properties he then declares that these properties are actually judgements of properties.  He considers judgements of the properties of consciousness to be identical to the properties themselves. He writes:

&lt;font face=&quot;times&quot;&gt;&quot;The infallibilist line on qualia treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infallibility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Having identified &quot;properties&quot; with &quot;judgement of properties&quot; he can then show that the judgements are insubstantial, hence the properties are insubstantial and hence the qualia are insubstantial or even non-existent. Dennett concludes that qualia can be rejected as non-existent:

&lt;font face=&quot;times&quot;&gt;&quot;So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors-- private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority--not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing--but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re- identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all. &quot; (Dennett 1988)&lt;/font&gt;

Dennett's asserts that &quot;a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F&quot;. This is a statement of the belief that qualia are the same as processes such as judgements. Processes such as judgements are flows of data where one state examines a previous state in a succession over time and embody what Whitehead called the &quot;materialist&quot; concept of time.  Dennett does not consider how a scientific concept of time might affect his argument.

Dennett's argument has been persuasive and there are now many philosophers and neuroscientists who believe that the problem of phenomenal consciousness does not exist. This means that, to them, what we call 'consciousness' can only be a property of the functions performed by the brain and body. According to these philosophers only access consciousness exists. 

Those who support the idea of phenomenal consciousness also tend to frame it in terms of nineteenth century theory where one state examines a previous state in a succession over time, for instance Edelman(1993) places the past in memories at an instant and time within experience is explained as continuing modelling processes:

&lt;font face=&quot;times&quot;&gt;&quot;Primary consciousness is the state of being mentally aware of things in the world--of having mental images in the present. But it is not accompanied by any sense of a person with a past and a future.... In contrast, higher-order consciousness involves the recognition by a thinking subject of his or her own acts or affections. It embodies a model of the personal, and of the past and the future as well as the present. It exhibits direct awareness--the noninferential or immediate awareness of mental episodes without the involvement of sense organs or receptors. It is what we humans have in addition to primary consciousness. We are conscious of being conscious.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

Block(2004) also suggests this flow from state to state in his idea of &quot;Reflexivity&quot; where our idea of familiarity with an object is due to one state being analysed by another: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times&quot;&gt;&quot;Thus in the “conscious” case, the subject must have a state that is about the subject’s own perceptual experience (looking familiar) and thus conscious in what might be termed a “reflexive” sense. An experience is conscious in this sense just in case it is the object of another of the subject’s states; for example, one has a thought to the effect that one has that experience. The reflexive sense of 'consciousness' contrasts with phenomenality, which perhaps attaches to some states which are not the objects of other mental states. Reflexive consciousness might better be called ‘awareness’ than ‘consciousness’. Reflexivity is phenomenality plus something else (reflection) and that opens up the possibility in principle for phenomenality without reflection. For example, it is at least conceptually possible for there to be two people in pain, one of whom is introspecting the pain the other not. (Perhaps infants or animals can have pain but don’t introspect it.) The first is reflexively conscious of the pain, but both have phenomenally conscious states, since pain is by its very nature a phenomenally conscious state. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Both Block and Edelman allow phenomenal consciousness, our experience, as an unexplained phenomenon. Block, Edelman and also Dennett's ideas of consciousness are shown in the illustration below:

[[Image:Constudphen.gif]]

This model differs from the empirical reports of phenomenal consciousness that were considered earlier.  According to the empirical reports the present moment in our experience is extended so the succession of outputs or stages of access consciousness could constitute the contents of phenomenal consciousness. In other words phenomenal consciousness is composed of periods of access consciousness. This is how it seems to the empiricist and in our own experience but how such a state could be explained in terms of brain activity is highly problematical. Given that nineteenth century ideas cannot explain such a state a scientific explanation will be required.

The idea that phenomenal consciousness misrepresents or &quot;misdiscovers&quot; itself (Dennett 1988) deserves further discussion. According to materialism the present instant has no duration so can only be known in succeeding instants as a report or memory and this could be wrong. Whitehead considered that this viewpoint originates in an archaic view of science, particularly the concept of time in science:

&quot;The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries accepted as their natural philosophy a certain circle of concepts which were as rigid and definite as those of the philosophy of the middle ages, and were accepted with as little critical research. I will call this natural philosophy 'materialism.' Not only were men of science materialists, but also adherents of all schools of philosophy. The idealists only differed from the philosophic materialists on question of the alignment of nature in reference to mind. But no one had any doubt that the philosophy of nature considered in itself was of the type which I have called materialism. It is the philosophy which I have already examined in my two lectures of this course preceding the present one. It can be summarised as the belief that nature is an aggregate of material and that this material exists in some sense at each successive member of a one-dimensional series of extensionless instants of time. Furthermore the mutual relations of the material entities at each instant formed these entities into a spatial configuration in an unbounded space. It would seem that space---on this theory-would be as instantaneous as the instants, and that some explanation is required of the relations between the successive instantaneous spaces. The materialistic theory is however silent on this point; and the succession of instantaneous spaces is tacitly combined into one persistent space. This theory is a purely intellectual rendering of experience which has had the luck to get itself formulated at the dawn of scientific thought. It has dominated the language and the imagination of science since science flourished in Alexandria, with the result that it is now hardly possible to speak without appearing to assume its immediate obviousness.&quot; (Whitehead 1920).

==Direct Realism and Direct Perception==

Direct Realism proposes that phenomenal experience is directly objects in the world without any intervening representation.  It is motivated by the belief that the Problem of Regression, the Subject-Object Paradox and the recursion form of the Homunculus arguments show that phenomenal consciousness cannot occur in the brain alone. Direct Realists reason that if phenomenal consciousness cannot be things in the brain then it must be something outside the brain.

There are two principle types of Direct Realism: Natural Dualism and Behaviourism (both Radical and Analytical). Some behaviourists use the term “Direct Perception” rather than Direct Realism and consider that only the invariant parts of perception are direct (see for instance Michaels and Carello 1981). Thomas Reid is generally regarded as the founder of Direct Realism. In his Natural Dualism he proposed that the soul is in direct contact with the contents of experience and these contents are things in the world beyond the body. The Direct Realism of Reid is summarised in the statement of his famous disciple Sir William Hamilton: &quot;In the simplest act of perception I am conscious of myself as the perceiving subject and of an external reality as the object perceived&quot;.  Reid's Natural Dualism has now been largely replaced by radical and analytical behaviourism which eschew the idea of a soul and propose that phenomenal consciousness, if it exists at all, is a behavioural reflex.

The modern justification of Direct Realism mainly consists of arguments against Indirect Realism or Representationalism. Philosophers such as Austin (1962) and Le Morvan (2004) have summarised the Direct Realism debate and have identified the following arguments in favour of Indirect Realism and given rebuttals to each of them:

1. The Causal Argument: perception involves a succession of causal events such as the reflection of photons, bleaching of retinal pigments etc. so perception must involve the end of this causal chain. The Direct Realist response is that, although there may be a causal chain in sensation this does not inevitably imply that the end of the chain is the content of phenomenal experience.

2. The Time Lag Argument: it takes time for light to travel from an object to the senses, time for chemical changes in the retina etc...  The Direct Realist response is that direct perception may be referred back in time.

3. The Partial Character of Perception Argument: we only perceive the surface of objects, and then only a part of the surface. As the whole object would be perceived directly perception must be indirect. The Direct Realist response is that direct perception could occur even if only parts of an object were perceived.

4. The Perceptual Relativity Argument: things appear to be different shapes depending upon the point of view. The Direct Realist response is that if perception can occur backwards in time it should have no problem occurring back down a line of sight. However, Le Morvan's argument does not seem to encompass the geometrical nature of phenomenal experience, seeking to explain geometry in terms of movement.

5. The Argument from Perceptual Illusion: A stick may appear bent when projecting from the surface of water. Direct Realists apply the argument used in (4) to this problem. The bent stick illusion is a physical event in the world beyond the eye rather than a normal optical illusion such as the Muller-Lyer illusion etc., see (6) for a discussion of optical illusions.   

6. The Argument from Hallucination: Hallucinations are not in the world beyond the body. This is highly problematical for Direct Realists especially when phenomena such as lucid dreams, dreams and visual imaginations are included along with hallucinations. Direct Realists classify these phenomena as not being perceptions or deny that they actually exist as phenomena. Indirect Realists would maintain that all of perception is a reconstruction and use optical illusions such as the Muller-Lyer, Ames Room etc. to justify this contention so the Direct Realist approach to hallucination, dreams etc. might seem like an unwillingness to accept Indirect Realism rather than an argument. 

7. The Dubitability Argument (cf: Indubitability argument): we cannot doubt current phenomenal experience but we can doubt the world beyond the body therefore phenomenal experience is not the world beyond the body. Direct Realists fall back on Presentism or functional Presentism to defeat this argument. If phenomenal experience is instantaneous and made anew at each instant then anything can be doubted.

The points above have summarised the Direct Realist stance on visual perception. Other sensory modalities have also been considered in the Direct Realism debate. 

Fowler (1986) considered that sounds were attached to objects in the world. This idea is strange because sounds only seem to be closely attached to objects in the world when these objects are seen as well as heard. For example, when a subject is blindfolded it is found that there can be a large error in locating the position of a sound in the world, this is especially true for low frequency sounds.  The Direct Realist approach has difficulty explaining the transition from sounds with an indefinite location when a subject is blindfolded to sounds that are bound to visual events when the blindfold is removed. It also runs into problems explaining how the sound of speech from a single loudspeaker can become bound to lip movements on a cinema screen.  If the binding does not occur in the brain then where does it occur? 

Pain is particularly problematic for Direct Realism because, unlike colour vision where 'red' is inferred to be a property of electrons or light, pain is an inner experience that is not a property of tissue damage. Tissue damage has properties such as bleeding, wheal formation etc. but pain seems to be phenomenal experience in the brain and 'phantom pain' can occur without tissue damage (see Aydede (2001), Tye (2004) and Chapman, and Nakamura (1999) for further analysis). On closer inspection other sensations also appear to be inner experiences rather than direct sensations. For instance, the red crosses of different hues in the illustration below are all due to the same physical wavelengths of light. In this case the range of hues in experience is unrelated to the actual physical red on the page or screen. 

Another problem for Direct Realism is that it does not overcome the problems that it is supposed to solve. The argument for Direct Realism begins with the idea that there are severe problems with representationalism (the idea that phenomenal experience is in the brain) and that direct perception is an alternative that does not have these problems. However on closer inspection Direct Realism suffers from almost same problems as representationalism. If phenomenal experience is the world itself then Ryle's regress applies to the world itself and this can only be avoided by assuming that phenomenal experience is a subset of the world (i.e.: a representation) that receives input from other parts of the world that are not part of phenomenal experience. 

It is also commonly assumed that Direct Realism avoids the recursion argument because it is believed that the separation of the observer from the things that are observed is simply due to the geometry of the world. If such simple geometry is possible between the eye and the world then it should also be possible in the brain and a similar geometrical explanation could be invoked to avoid recursion in representations.

These points are shown in the illustration below:

[[image:Constuddir1.gif]]

Scientists have a further problem with Direct Realism. The illustration below demonstrates that our scientific knowledge of the world differs markedly from our phenomenal experience.  

[[image:constuddirect.gif]]

It is difficult to see how the form and content of phenomenal experience could supervene directly on the world beyond the body. The world inferred from measurements beyond the body seems to be a nebulous set of quantum phenomena that are arranged as probability fields in three dimensions at any instant. The objects in this real world are mostly space. The world of phenomenal experience on the other hand contains objects that are one-sided, and are like a 2 dimensional field of vectors directed simultaneously at an observation point which is apparently separate from them.  Phenomenal experience is not three dimensional, the rear of objects is not available within it at any instant. Visual phenomenal experience seems to be a geometrical relationship between an abstract observation point and the reflection properties of the part of the world external to the body. It is a form that crudely overlies the angular separations in inferred reality, providing approximate directional data.  It is not like things in themselves beyond the body, not even in type, being a set of directional vectors. 
(See the module on the neuroscience of perception for a discussion of depth perception).

If the form and content of visual phenomenal experience are abstractions separated according to the angular positions of things in the world beyond the body then theories which propose that phenomenal experience is the world itself are problematical. It should be noted that things arranged according to angular positions can appear to overlie any group of similar things along a radius from the centre point.  

[[Image:Constuddirectangle.gif]]

If Direct Realists admit that things are as they appear to be, observed according to angular positions at a 'point eye', then any representation of things on the inside of a sphere of any radius would appear similar. The geometry of the 'point eye' is problematical whether the view contains the world itself or a representation of the world; it cannot be the movements of lumps of matter or energy and the point observation cannot be due to lumps all landing at a point. In other words the 'view' is inconsistent with nineteenth century materialism and will require a scientific explanation.

Radical and Analytical Behaviourism tackle the problem of the difference between the world inferred from measurements beyond the body and the phenomenal world by denying phenomenal consciousness and maintaining that access and reflex consciousness are all that exists or is necessary. Radical Behaviourism is an offshoot of psychological behaviourism and was established as a philosophical adjunct to Marxism by Vygotsky and popularised by Burrhus Frederic Skinner (see Skinner 1953).  There is another movement in psychological behaviourism which is similar to Radical Behaviourism called Ecological Psychology (see Gibson 1966, 1979 and also Michaels and Carello 1981). Analytical Behaviourism is a philosophical movement established by Gilbert Ryle (see Ryle 1949).

The core of Analytical and Radical Behaviourism is the assumption that consciousness exists for a durationless instant so that the Dubitability Argument and the Regression and Recursion Arguments can be applied (Ryle 1949, Skinner 1971 and see the sections on Ryle's Regress and the Subject-Object Paradox above).  As a result the Direct Realist is able to insinuate that subjects only think that they have had a particular experience (cf: Dennett 1991a). It is intriguing that Eliminativists also maintain that experience is the world itself, for instance an insight into Dennett's idea of the mind is to be found on pages 407-408 of Consciousness Explained:

&quot;It seemed to him, according to the text, as if his mind - his visual field - were filled with intricate details of gold-green buds an wiggling branches, but although this is how it seemed this was an illusion. No such &quot;plenum&quot; ever came into his mind; the plenum remained out in the world where it is didn't have to be represented, but could just be. When we marvel, in those moments of heightened self-consciousness, at the glorious richness of our conscious experience, the richness we marvel at is actually the richness of the world outside, in all its ravishing detail. It does not &quot;enter&quot; our conscious minds, but is simply available&quot; 

This is a clear description of Direct Realism (although Dennett does not describe himself as a direct realist).

Radical Behaviourism is sometimes described as the dictum that the only psychological events that are of importance are those that occur outside the head. The absurdity of this has led to jokes:

Q: What does one behaviorist say to another when they meet on the street? 

A: You're fine. How am I? 

Q: What does one behaviorist say to another after sex? 

A: That was great for you. How was it for me?

(Ziff 1958)

However Vygotsky, Skinner and other Radical Behaviourists hold that inner behaviour is possible so that events within the brain can result in reward or punishment.  Vygotsky (1925) describes this approach:

&quot;Consciousness is wholly reduced to the transmitting mechanisms of reflexes operating according to general laws, i.e., no processes other than reactions can be admitted into the organism. The way is also paved for the solution of the problem of self-awareness and self-observation. Inner perception and introspection are possible only thanks to the existence of a proprioceptive field and secondary reflexes, which are connected with it. This is always the echo of a reaction.&quot;

Hence Radical Behaviourists are able to make the claim that what are believed to be representations with phenomenal content are processes. Even events such as pain can then be explained as reflexes involving organs within the skin.  However, by opening the possibility that such reflexes could occur at any sense organ, including the eye, this makes Radical Behaviourism a mixed Direct Realist/Indirect Realist philosophy with consciousness as a process, not a separate thing such as phenomenal consciousness (see the section on representationalism and intentionality below). 

But this raises a serious issue for science: can the phenomenal consciousness that seems to contain our observations really be argued out of existence on the basis of a theory? As Gregory (1988) put it: “ ‘If you can’t explain it – deny it’ is one strategy for dealing with embarrassing questions such as ‘what is consciousness?’ ”.  But is this the right strategy? 

Direct Realism fails to overcome the problems of regression and recursion inherent in representations.  It proposes that phenomenal consciousness is identical to the physical world beyond the body but must then use a plethora of arguments to explain why this is evidently not so. When confronted with these problems its proponents resort to the argument that everything can be doubted and can misrepresent itself. Yet it is still widely believed.

It should be noted that Direct Realism is espoused in Religious Natural Dualism, some forms of Augustinian theology, nineteenth century materialism and its offspring such as Marxism, post-modernism, post-Marxism, and various sociological movements. It is also necessary for some forms of Strong AI to occur. Perhaps this explains why few ideas have attracted as much attention and defence as Direct Realism.

It is interesting to compare the Direct Realist and Indirect Realist interpretations of something as simple as a cartoon on television (such as the image below). According to Indirect Realism the cartoon would be a moving representation constructed in the brain using data from the senses. This leads to the prediction of brain mechanisms for modelling motions, combining colours, binding sound and vision etc., many of which have been verified. Can you demonstrate how the theory of Direct Realism could explain the phenomenal experience that contains the cartoon and produce a list of the predictions made by the theory?

[[Image:constudcartoon.gif]]

In science a theory should be of predictive value, for instance, information theory describes how the state of a thing can be impressed on a carrier so that a signal can be transmitted from one place to another. This theory predicts what will happen when the signal arrives at its destination and how the state of the source can be inferred from the events at the destination, the total amount of information that can be transmitted etc. At the destination it is the form of the signal that is directly known by interaction and measurement, the form of the source is inferred. Direct Realism is a direct challenge to this information theory but does it deliver a more powerful predictive description of phenomenal consciousness or is experience always dependent on what happens to the information flow between things in the world and somewhere in the brain? Does direct realism have a physical theory?

Ultimately it appears as if Direct Realism is about various understandings of Information Theory.  For example, Austin (1962) discusses what we see when we see a church camouflaged as a barn and comments that: &quot;We see, of course, a church that now looks like a barn.&quot;. Do we see a church or a barn?  Scientific information theory is clear about this, the church is an entity composed of selected information from the quantum state of its constituents, the optical image of a camouflaged church is an arrangement of photons emanating from a screen on which it is projected, the retina has an arrangement of chemical and electrical events based on an optical image and conscious visual experience correlates with the arrangement of things on the retina. The fact that conscious experience also correlates with classifications of the retinal image as a barn or a church suggests that conscious experience is an arrangement of things in the brain based on both the retinal arrangement and the contents of a relational database. 

Austin's arguments have been mythologised as a final demonstration that &quot;sense data&quot; theories are false. However, as will be seen below, sense data theories merely claim that there is a succession of information states between an information state outside the body and that reported as conscious experience i.e.: subjects report that a church is camouflaged when it is camouflaged. 

==Indirect Realism==

Indirect realism proposes that phenomenal consciousness exists and is a set of signals or '''sense data''', usually in the brain. This was proposed by philosophers from Aristotle to Locke and was probably the most widespread idea of conscious experience until the eighteenth century. 

The idea of sense data is discussed in depth by Russell (1912).  Russell's original definition is given below:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Let us give the name of 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation: such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and so on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the experience of being immediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever we see a colour, we have a sensation of the colour, but the colour itself is a sense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that of which we are immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. It is plain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be by means of the sense-data -- brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness, etc. -- which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have been given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even that the sense-data are directly properties of the table.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Russell's definition is a materialist concept in which experience is always '''of''' something because the durationless instant of the present has always gone. As such it differs from some empiricist ideas where experience is not confined to the durationless instant.

Science is Indirect Realist because it holds that the scientist can only make '''measurements''' of events in the world. These measurements give rise to signals as a result of interaction with the event. According to '''decoherence theory''' the signals are a state that is a mixture of the state of the measuring instrument and the state of the thing being measured. For example, the eyes are measuring instruments that are sensitive to photons, photons are signals containing a state that is based on the state of electrons in a surface and the state of electrons is based on the state of the surface etc. Scientific inference allows some aspects of the state of the surface to be inferred from the state of the photons.

In modern Indirect Realism there is an attempt to distinguish the phenomenal content of conscious experience from the processing involved in accessing this phenomenal content. According to these theories phenomenal experience is an arrangement of signals that are the content of the experience. This arrangement forms a ''representation'' of things in the world so this form of indirect realism is known as '''Representationalism'''. Tye (2003) describes types of representationalist theory:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Representationalism, as I have presented it so far, is an identity thesis with respect to qualia: qualia are supposedly one and the same as certain representational contents.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; 

Tye also describes variants of this idea of representationalism:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Sometimes it is held instead that qualia are one and the same as certain representational properties of experiences; and sometimes it is is argued that these representational properties are themselves irreducible (Siewert 1998). There is also a weaker version of representationalism, according to which it is metaphysically necessary that experiences exactly alike with respect to their representational contents are exactly alike with respect to their qualia. Obviously, this supervenience thesis leaves open the further question as to the essential nature of qualia.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; (Tye 2003).

In a scientific sense Direct Realists believe that phenomenal experience is the signals that occur next to things in the world  beyond the body (which they call &quot;things in themselves&quot;) and Indirect Realists usually believe that phenomenal experience is signals in the brain.  It can be seen from the pattern of signal flow that the signals travelling into the brain preserve the spatial relationships of the original signals and encode the properties in the original signals.  This means that the original signals next to the QM sources and the signals in the brain are equivalent provided the latter are oriented appropriately relative to signals from the body. Either set of signals could transmit or contain the same information. Both Direct and Indirect Realism cannot, at present, explain the physics of how a viewing point occurs in experience i.e.: how we seem to see through an apparent space to the signals that are the contents of experience. So the choice between Direct Realism and Indirect Realism reduces to whether there is only one set of signals or a chain of signals between the world and phenomenal experience. 

The philosophical arguments for Indirect Realism are listed below:

1. Variable perspective: when we see things the view changes so what we see must be a different set of signals depending on the view rather than a constant object.

2. Illusions: we can see through fingers and see a variety of colours where measurements tell us one exists. Direct Realists quote the &quot;bent stick illusion&quot;, which is not really an illusion at all, being a physical event.

3. Hallucinations: two people can have phenomenal experience containing a table. The first may be viewing a real table whereas the second may be hallucinating a table. If the tables are the same (phenomenally) then experience is indirect.

4. Double vision: press the side of one eye, two images appear (cf Hume 1739) yet there are not two things in the world.

5. Time gap arguments: according to materialism the past has gone. The things being seen no longer exist in the state that relates to the state in experience. In the extreme case, some stars in the night sky no longer exist but are still in experience so experience must be a derived signal.

6. Secondary qualities such as pain, colour and smell do not exist as physical things in the source of signals and are likely to be properties of  signals in the brain.

[[Image:constudindirect.gif]]

Indirect Realism has received strong support from recent discoveries in neuroscience, for example, it is now clear that both the colour and motion in phenomenal experience are added by cortical processes. In Cerebral '''Achromatopsia''' patients have suffered trauma to area V4 of the cerebral cortex and report seeing the world in greyscale with no colour vision and in Congenital Achromatopsia people do not even understand the meaning of 'colour'. In an astonishing ailment called '''Akinetopsia''' patients perceive movement as a succession of stationary images (Rizzo ''et al.'' 1995). Akinetopsia is usually associated with damage to cortical area V5. Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) have demonstrated that the addition of colour occurs more rapidly than the addition of motion.  The section on the Neuroscience of Consciousness describes these discoveries and many other aspects of the creation of phenomenal experience in the brain.

Unfortunately knowledge of the whereabouts of the signals that are the content of conscious experience does not resolve the problem of phenomenal consciousness. Whether these signals are next to objects in the world or at the end of a chain of signals in the brain there still remains the problem of how they become arranged in the form of experience. If such a thing occurs at all.

===Intentionality and representation===

There is a materialist interpretation of representationalism in which representations are redefined as intentional states:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;One way of explaining what is meant by ‘intentionality’ in the (more obscure) philosophical sense is this: it is that aspect of mental states or events that consists in their being of or about things (as pertains to the questions, ‘What are you thinking of?’ and ‘What are you thinking about?’). Intentionality is the aboutness or directedness of mind (or states of mind) to things, objects, states of affairs, events. So if you are thinking about San Francisco, or about the increased cost of living there, or about your meeting someone there at Union Square -- your mind, your thinking, is directed toward San Francisco, or the increased cost of living, or the meeting in Union Square. To think at all is to think of or about something in this sense. This ‘directedness’ conception of intentionality plays a prominent role in the influential philosophical writings of Franz Brentano and those whose views developed in response to his (to be discussed further in Section 3).&quot;(Siewert 2003)&lt;/font&gt;

This definition allows &quot;representation&quot; to be redefined as a data stream rather than a set of things arranged in some mental or neural state that represents things in space. Husserl thought this approach would allow a description of consciousness that &quot;carefully abstains from affirming the existence of anything in spatio-temporal reality&quot; (Siewert 2003) although it could be argued that a data stream such as any description can never escape the constraints of representation in time at some place. 

Unfortunately the concept of &quot;intentionality&quot; has become so diverse that it could be applied to almost any aspect of the description of consciousness.  An interesting example of this is given by Loar (2001) where &quot;intentionality&quot; is considered to overlap &quot;representing&quot; and &quot;conceiving&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;A person's thoughts represent things to her -- conceive things -- in many ways: perceptually, memory-wise, descriptively, by naming, by analogy, by intuitive sorting, theoretically, abstractly, implicitly and explicitly. These various manners of conceiving have something in common: they have intentional properties, and they have them essentially. &lt;/font&gt;

The usage of the term &quot;intentional state&quot; has become so broad that it now means little more than a state that is about another state.

===Cartesian materialism===

The term &quot;Cartesian materialism&quot; once meant the idea that the mind is in the brain (see for instance Block 1995).  The term had largely fallen out of use in philosophy until revived by Daniel Dennett (1991) in the book ''Consciousness Explained''.  Dennett uses a very particular definition of the term in his discussions and also uses a particular definition of the word &quot;mind&quot;. See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_Nineteenth_and_twentieth_century_philosophy#Daniel_Clement_Dennett_.281942_-.29 section on Daniel Dennett] for Dennett's critique. Philosophers who adhere to the idea that the mind is in the brain tend to call themselves &quot;indirect realists&quot; or &quot;representationalists&quot; where the substrate of conscious experience is in the brain and would deny that Dennett's critique applies to their proposals. Dennett's critique makes the materialist assumption that if there is a representation in the brain then a further flow of material out of this representation would be required for the representation to become part of mind.

===Identity theories of mind===

The idea that mental states are brain states is known as the '''identity theory of mind'''. There are two sorts of identity theory, in '''type''' identity theory it is held that mental states are identical to brain states whereas in '''token''' identity theory it is held that mental states correlate with brain states. 

Type identity theory was attacked by Putnam in &quot;The Nature of Mental States&quot; where he pointed out that if mental states are functions then type identity theory would presuppose that animals that had the same mental states would need to have identical brain structures. He suggested that this is unlikely, it being more probable that animals have functional systems that perform similar overall functions but which are not identical. In other words, if it is assumed that conscious experience is a set of functions then token identity theory is more probable than type identity theory.

Putnam's critique does not preclude identity theories of mind that involve &quot;passive ideas&quot; (i.e.: states that are not classical functions).

Most identity theories of mind would be representational, the physical states representing the world in some way. All identity theories of mind involve Cartesian materialism in the sense of the mental states being brain states. According to identity theories the mind is in the brain.

==Dualism==
Prior to considering the arguments surrounding dualism it is important to have a clear idea of &quot;information&quot; because many of these arguments have parallels with the difference between information as a set of states that can be transmitted and the substrate on which this information is expressed or from which the information is derived. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_Models_of_access_consciousness#Elementary_Information_and_Information_Systems_Theory Elementary information and information systems theory].

===Cartesian dualism===

Descartes, a philosopher, analysed his experience and developed an empirical description of how it is arranged. He described mental images and perceptions as extended in space and with a duration.  He called these extended things '''ideas''' (Cartesian ideas) and proposed that they are patterns in the brain.  Descartes thought the pineal gland was the most likely location for these ideas because it is one of the few single organs in the brain. He also proposed that there is a rational soul that directly contacts these ideas: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Now among these figures, it is not those imprinted on the external sense organs, or on the internal surface of the brain, which should be taken to be ideas - but only those which are traced in the spirits on the surface of gland H ''(where the seat of the imagination and the 'common sense' is located)''. That is to say, it is only the latter figures which should be taken to be the forms or images which the rational soul united to this machine will consider directly when it imagines some object or perceives it by the senses.&quot; Descartes (1664)&lt;/font&gt;

See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_Descartes_and_the_empiricists section on Descartes] for more information and references.

Descartes considered that the soul was a physical point, an unextended entity that acts like a mind's eye. He called this unextended place the ''res cogitans'' and concluded that it was a substance that differed from that of material things:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;.. I thence concluded that I was a substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking, and which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on any material thing; so that &quot; I,&quot; that is to say, the mind by which I am what I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is even more easily known than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not, it would still continue to be all that it is.&quot;Descartes (1637)&lt;/font&gt; 

This unextended substance that is not material gives the word &quot;substance&quot; a new meaning. It has been attacked as a concept by Locke, Hume, Berkely and many other philosophers. The concept of there being two substances, that which composes the physical world and that which composes the soul, is the origin of the word '''Dualism''' but dualism, as a concept, has been extended beyond this original meaning. Cartesian dualism is a type of '''substance dualism'''.

Cartesian dualism is an attempt to explain our experience. According to Descartes something supernatural would be needed for an unextended viewing point to exist.

Reid's '''Natural Dualism''' also has a point soul looking at things but proposes that the things in question are forms in the world rather than in the brain.

===Property dualism===

Another sort of dualism has arisen out of a particular interpretation of the regress and homunculus arguments.  These arguments show that phenomenal experience is not due entirely to flows from place to place (i.e.: it is not due to classical processes and functions). Property dualism asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge. 

As Goldman (1993) pointed out, qualitative experience does not seem to be needed in a functional description of a  system: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;For any functional description of a system that is in pain (or has an itch), it seems as if we can imagine another system with the same functional description but lacking the qualitative property of painfulness (or itchiness).&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

Certainly a functional system that merely reports the words &quot;I am in pain&quot; when it is dropped on the floor does not require any qualitative property of painfulness. The ''absent qualia'' arguments suggest that even in a large system there would be no need for qualitative properties for the performance of any classical function. 

Chalmers (1993) commenting on Goldman's point, said that this implies that '''zombies''' might exist, functional replicas of humans but without qualia.  He then denied that a complete functional replica of a human could exist without also including qualia:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;It seems to me that the only way to avoid this conclusion is to deny that Zombie Dave is a conceptual possibility; and the only principled way to deny that Zombie Dave is a conceptual possibility is to allow that functional organization is conceptually constitutive of qualitative content.&quot; Chalmers (1993).&lt;/font&gt;

In other words he identifies qualia with function. According to Chalmers (1996) qualia are a particular type of function: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;I claim that conscious experience arises from fine-grained functional organization. More specifically, I will argue for a principle of organizational invariance, holding that given any system that has conscious experiences, then any system that has the same fine-grained functional organization will have qualitatively identical experiences. According to this principle, consciousness is an organizational invariant: a property that remains constant over all functional isomorphs of a given system. Whether the organization is realized in silicon chips, in the population of China, or in beer cans and ping-pong balls does not matter. As long as the functional organisation is right, conscious experience will be determined.&quot; p249&lt;/font&gt;

Chalmers' idea of functional organisation has within it a sometimes vague implication that the functional units must have a particular form; for instance, in the development of his argument, he refers to “fine grained” replacement of organic functional units with inorganic units.

Chalmers is actually making two major points, firstly that qualia occur during the motion of things (functions), secondly  that qualia are independent of any particular substrate.**  For the first point to be consistent with materialism the qualia must have no effect on the function, they must be '''epiphenomenal'''.  Epiphenomenal qualia would not be forbidden by the regress and homunculus arguments and would be akin to Berkeley's &quot;passive ideas&quot;.

Whether or not epiphenomenal qualia are physical depends upon the definition of the word &quot;physical&quot;.  If physical functions cause qualia but qualia cannot affect functions then the qualia are &quot;physical&quot; in the sense of being caused by physical events but might be regarded as non-physical in the sense of being isolated from further physical events.  In philosophical terms they violate the principle of '''Causal Closure'''.  However, there are other definitions of physicalism based on arguments such as '''Methodological Naturalism''' which hold that anything that can be investigated using the methods of natural science is a physical thing (see Stoljar 2001).  Thus, although epiphenomenal qualia may not conform to materialism they may be encompassed by physicalism; as events that are related to material events they are awaiting a physical theory of how they emerge from a given function. 

The reader might consider whether phenomenal consciousness is indeed epiphenomenal. Empirical reports describe it as something that is different from the world beyond the body (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_The_conflict2#Direct_Realism direct realism]) - could we generate empirical reports of an epiphenomenon?

The term '''property dualism''' describes how physical events might give rise to a set of properties that cannot be predicted from the fine structure of the physical system. The &quot;dualism&quot; is present because one set of events is related to two sets of properties, one of which is not related by materialism to the set of events. In the case of the proposal about consciousness outlined above an extra assumption, beyond materialism, would be needed to explain qualia.  Property dualism might be defined as a theory that there could be a theory of consciousness but that this requires some new assumption.

As far as the &quot;when and where&quot; of consciousness are concerned, property dualism states that it is somewhere in the processes performed by the organism and the parts of the organism. 

&lt;font size=1&gt; ** In terms of information processing, Chalmers is proposing that qualia are the enactment of a particular information processing structure.&lt;/font&gt;

===Predicate dualism===

Predicate dualism is the view espoused by most non-reductive physicalists, such as Donald Davidson(1980) and Jerry Fodor(1968), who maintain that while there is only one ontological category of substances and properties of substances (usually physical), the predicates that we use to describe mental events cannot be redescribed in terms of (or reduced to) physical predicates of natural languages. If we characterize predicate monism as the view subscribed to by eliminative materialists, who maintain that such intentional predicates as believe, desire, think, feel, etc., will eventually be eliminated from both the language of science and from ordinary language because the entities to which they refer do not exist, then predicate dualism is most easily defined as the negation of this position. Predicate dualists believe that so-called &quot;folk psychology&quot;, with all of its propositional attitude ascriptions, is an ineliminable part of the enterprise of describing, explaining and understanding human mental states and behavior.

Davidson, for example, subscribes to Anomalous Monism, according to which there can be no strict psycho-physical laws which connect mental and physical events under their descriptions as mental and physical events. However, all mental events also have physical descriptions. It is in terms of the latter that such events can be connected in law-like relations with other physical events. Mental predicates are irreducibly different in character (rational, holistic and necessary) from physical predicates (contingent, atomic and causal).

===The interaction between mind and brain in dualism===

====Interactionism====

Interactionism is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding the fact that it is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of logical argumentation or empirical proof. It is appealing to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.

====Epiphenomalism====

According to epiphenomenalism, all mental events are caused by a physical event and have no physical consequences. So, a mental event of deciding to pick up a rock (call it &quot;M&quot;) is caused by the firing of specific neurons in the brain (call it &quot;P&quot;), however when the arm and hand move to pick up a rock (call it &quot;E&quot;) this is only caused by P. The physical causes are in principle reducible to fundamental physics, and therefore mental causes are eliminated using this reductionist explanation. If P causes M and E, there is no overdetermination in the explanation for E.

====Parallelism====

Psycho-physical parallelism is a very unusual view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps only truly, advocated by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of occasionalism, stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz idea is that God has created a pre-established harmony such that it only seems as if physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence the term parallelism is used to describe this view.

====Occasionalism====

Occasionalism argues that bodily events are the occasion of an act by the Creator causing a corresponding mental event, and vice versa. Any such view requires a theological structure as a premise.

==Idealism==
According to Idealism only the mental truly exists. 

The form and content of personal conscious experience might be related to the structure of the world and brain in several ways. It could be a '''solipsism''' or be the mind of God.

''This is a '''stub''' and needs expansion''.

==Panpsychism==
According to Panpsychism everything in the world may be conscious; consciousness is a fundamental entity like energy. Conscious experience is then due to an interaction of conscious entities, personal conscious experience being centred on the individual. In some interpretations, such as monadism, Panpsychism and Idealism can overlap because the universe is conceived as being composed of an infinity of point consciousnesses that each contain information about the whole universe. &lt;!-- Intriguingly an idea similar to this has been suggested as a possible explanation of Bell's Theorem in Quantum Mechanics see The problem of space, QM Monadism (item not yet added to book) --&gt;

The form and content of personal conscious experience might be related to the structure of the world and brain in many ways.

''This is a '''stub''' and needs expansion''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Quantum Mechanics ==

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics developed in the first part of the 20th century that was highly successful in explaining the behavior of atoms, molecules and nuclei. Developed between 1900 and 1930 and later combined with the general and special theory of relativity, it revolutionized the field of physics. The new concepts, which were the particle properties of radiation, the wave properties of matter, quantization of physical properties and the idea that one can no longer know exactly where a single particle such as an electron is at any one time were necessary to explain all of the new experimental evidence that was available at the time. 

At the turn of the 20th century, classical theories were well-established for thermodynamics, optics, electromagnetism, and motion of  objects.  Classical predictions were very accurate for nearly every system that had been studied, and there was a common belief that all of the conceptual problems in chemistry and physics were essentially solved (although solving the equations for a large complex system could be computationally challenging).

A series of experimental results that could not be explained using classical mechanics ultimately led to the development of quantum mechanics.  As a result, much of modern chemistry has been explained using the principles of quantum mechanics: for example, atomic structure, molecular bonding, and all types of spectroscopy are directly related to quantum chemistry.  Quantum mechanics has also been applied to develop devices we use every day including semiconductors in the circuitry of our computers and lasers in our CD players.

BarnacleKB is a sardonic Washingtonian who mangles web sites by day for a small consultancy firm. By night, however, his superpowers reveal themselves and he typically saves the world by being immersed in motorsports.

When relaxing, he can often be found listening to loud obnoxius music, or reading books of absolutely no merit.

When all else fails, he sleeps.

He can be found on both [[User:BarnacleKB|Wikibooks]] and [[Wikipedia:User:BarnacleKB|Wikipedia]] under the pseudonym ''BarnacleKB''.

==Professional Life==

I am currently employed for a small strategic marketing consultancy as a web developer and rookie marketing wonk.

I prefer focusing on websites using [[Wikipedia:Xhtml|Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (xHTML)]] + [[Wikipedia:Cascading_Style_Sheets|Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)]].

Some of my previous occupations have included gigs as a warehouseman, bartender, and bump on a log.

==Recreational Life==

My biggest passion in life has to do with motorsport. I love all forms, but am generally less intersted when they only turn left.

I'm fond of automobiles in general, being a huge [[Wikipedia:BMW|Bimmerphile]] in particular.

==Personal Life==

I was born in the late 1970s in [[Wikipedia:Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park, Florida]], spent way too much of my life in [[Wikipedia:Duvall, Washington|Duvall, Washington]], and now live in [[Wikipedia:Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline, Washington]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book of the Month Award Template ==

I created a simple template to put onto the &quot;winning&quot; book that could show an &quot;award&quot; or special distinction has been granted to that book.  This is just something to get started, and feel free to [[:Template:Book of the Month|edit the template]] if you think some more work should be there.  I was trying to do something like the picture of the day or the article of the day on Wikipedia, and added a trophy picture I found on commons to show it was something special.  For now, this is just quick and dirty.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:08, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

We sure are running out of good wikibooks to host on the front page aren't we, ey? --[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 23:42, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

Is a &quot;Book of the Year&quot; award planned? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 8 July 2005 09:01 (UTC)

== BotM completeness ==

Out of curiosity, what characteristics do you look for when voting? How important is completeness? Many past BsotM are relatively complete, but many books that are less developed are nominated every month. The [[German]] book, for example, is far from complete, but seems to be coming along nicely. The extra attention received by an award would be beneficial for any developing book -- but I also understand the argument that developing books may not represent the &quot;best&quot; of Wikibooks to new or casual visitors. [[User:Vault|Vault]] 20:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

:I litterally try to vote on the best that is currently available on Wikibooks at the moment, and hasn't yet won the Book of the Month title.  Sometimes this does become a book that is not yet complete, mainly because Wikibooks is still a relatively new project.  It takes some time to complete a book and a lot of effort, usually from many people.  IMHO some books have &quot;won&quot; in the past due to the percieved benefit (and there is some) of getting a prominent place on the front page, which has resulted unfortunately in some &quot;sock puppet&quot; votes, or at least by relative newcommers to Wikibooks voting only for their favorite book because it is a topic they are interested in, not because it is necessarily the best on Wikibooks at the moment.  Some lower quality books have therefore won the monthly vote.  In the case of the [[German]] Wikibook, I think it has been developing quite nicely, and I don't have a personal objection to it becoming a Book of the month, although I think there are some better books out there.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:07, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

== Inflation ==

Is it too much to hand out an award (and icon) for a wikibook every month?  It seems like nearly everything on the main page now has an award next to it.  Maybe it'd be better to save the awards for the projects which are *really* producing something substantial and useful.  Otherwise the awards start to become a little meaningless or even counterproductive (all wikibooks with an award are not equal but it doesn't seem that way at first sight). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:195.72.169.116|195.72.169.116]] ([[User talk:195.72.169.116|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/195.72.169.116|contribs]]) 14:15, 20 March 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: The reason why so many books on the main page have an award to them is quite simple: Only bookshelves of the month books winners are shown on [[Template:Main Page navigation]]. Apart from BOTM winners, books with PDFs, Wikijunior Books, the 10 newest books, and so called [[Template:Highlighted|hot picks]] are shown. That is a pretty select group. Prehaps you want to participate in [[Template talk:Highlighted]] as well if you are concerned about the main page. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:10, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

::I'm not entirely sure that we even need to have the book of the month winners listed on the front page in this manner, as it is going to get us back to the original situation we had earlier with a huge pile of listings of random books.  Still, they are going to be somewhat higher quality than the [[Wikibooks:All Books|list of all Wikibooks]] was before on the front page.  On average, I would say that about 5-10 serious books are started on Wikibooks each month, so handing out an award every month is not going to run out of a supply of possible book titles.  The real trick is to dig up the gems that are buried in Wikibooks at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:13, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

== Voting Rules ==

If the rules is - just vote - why were 2 users deleted because they have less than 20 edits?&lt;BR&gt;
You can have arule saying one should have at least 50/100 edits. But at the moment there is no such rule - so the votes shouldn't be disregarded.

== Mailing list ==

*Anyway to get a monthly email telling us the book of the month?--[[User:203.214.95.227|203.214.95.227]] 13:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Updates For Blender 2.5 ==
I have added a couple of templates for marking keys as being specific to “Pre-Blender-2.5” or “Blender 2.5”. If you have a look on the Object Mode HotKeys page, you can see these being used in the definitions of CTRL+NKEY, CTRL+SKEY, CTRL+WKEY and CTRL+XKEY as examples. Let me know if you think this is (or isn’t) the right way to do it.

I would like to remove that note about merging this into the Noob to Pro book. That’s a tutorial book, this is a quick reference, the two serve quite different purposes, so they shouldn’t be merged. — [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 04:57, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
:I agree with Ldo.  I will remove the merge template. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 00:55, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

Hello, I've set up the new system for this wikibook.  It makes very heavy use of templates.  I'd like to write an explanation here about how one should go about adding to this reference, but that will have to wait for another day.  If you take a look around you should be able to see very quickly how it's all set up yourself (note you'll have to press the &quot;edit this page&quot; link on each page to see it's setup).  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 17:05, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

: This looks nice, but how can I find, let's say, locking X axis after I press GKEY? In previous HotKeys version was easy, I just pressed CTRL-F (find) in my browser and wrote ''lock'' in find window.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 06:53, 3 Jul 2005 (UTC)

I'll get that added :) --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 5 July 2005 13:01 (UTC)

Ok Popski I added those shortcuts to the book, plus a couple more.  Take a look at these pages as well:

[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Edit_Mode_HotKeys_Review]]

[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Object_Mode_HotKeys_Review]]

These templates can easily be added to other Blender books, and individual hotkey descriptions can also be added to tutorials because everything's templatized :)  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 5 July 2005 15:12 (UTC)

: I just wanted to say that in this template needs to be included [[Blender 3D: HotKeys/old|All]] HotKeys. I didn't want to mess this templates without previous discussion with you. BTW, HotKeys for locking axis in your upper links are wrong. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 5 July 2005 17:26 (UTC)

: I added All HotHeys in [[Template:Blender_3D:_HotKeys/Navigation]], maybe need this module different front page now... I'm so busy with IK right now that I don't have time to fill all HotKeys stuff in ''[[redlinks]]'' :) --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 18:52, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Maya-lighter-with-materials.jpg|350px|thumbnail|right|This is how your render will look if you follow this how-to and use the example-files I use.]]
How to import and render your SolidWorks model in Maya using the built in mental ray.

== Introduction ==
[[w:SolidWorks|SolidWorks]] is one of the main product design solid modellers. It has a built in render engine called PhotoWorks. With the release of PhotoWorks 2, rendering within SolidWorks has become more realistic and easier. In a lot of cases PhotoWorks will be the most convenient way to render your model, because you don't have to leave SolidWorks.
However, in some cases you will find the need to make renders that are more realistic (or even photo-realistic), and PhotoWorks is not sufficient anymore. This is when you might consider using an external program for rendering. In this how-to, I will describe how to do this using [[w:Maya_(software)|Alias Maya]] with [[w:Mental_ray|mental ray]].
I will be doing this with SolidWorks 2005 and Maya 6.5, but it will probably work in most other (recent) versions aswell.

== Exporting from SolidWorks ==
I will be working with a model (Created by '''Marko.M.Markovic''' [mailto:mmmarko@neobee.net mmmarko@neobee.net]) of a lighter that I downloaded from the [http://www.swugn.org/ SolidWorks Users Group Network (SWUGN)] at the bottom of the &quot;FREE SolidWorks models&quot; section.

Before you can import your model into Maya, you need to export it to the [[w:IGES|IGES]] format first.
In this how-to I will describe how to do this with an assembly, but it is essentially the same for a separate part.
* Open your assembly.
* If you don't want to export all the objects, select the objects that you DO want to export first. If you want to export the complete assembly, don't select anything.
* Go to File &gt; Save As...
* Select IGES as your file-type and click on the &quot;Options...&quot; button.
* Use the settings in the image below and click OK.
[[Image:Iges-settings.png]]
* If you had selected any objects in your assembly, SolidWorks will ask you if you want to export only the selected objects.
* You may also get the question if you want to resolve hidden, suppressed or lightweight objects first. Usually your answer will be &quot;Yes&quot;, unless you do not want to export certain parts.

== Importing in Maya ==
It is recommended that you now close SolidWorks for better performance. We'll now import the exported IGES data into Maya. It will probably look like a mess, but don't worry, we'll get to that.
* Start Maya.
* Go to File &gt; Open Scene..., locate your IGES file and hit Open. Note: large assemblies can take Maya a while to convert, so be patient!
Note: If Opening an IGES file is not available, you need to enable the plug in as follows.

Select Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Plug-in Manager 
to display the list of all known plug-ins. Click the loaded or auto load check box to load one of the ge2Export.mll, or ge2Export.so, or ge2Export.lib  and igesadd.mll  plug-ins. 

=== Cleaning up the scene ===
As you might or might not see, Maya will have quite a lot of duplicate parts and some settings need to be changed as well. Because this can be quite a lot of work, we'll do this by using the following MEL-script:

 string $select[] = `ls &quot;transform*&quot;`;
 delete $select;
 string $currentSelection [] = `ls -geometry`;
 string $loopSelection;
 for ($loopSelection in $currentSelection)
 {
 setAttr ($loopSelection + &quot;.&quot; + &quot;visibleInReflections&quot;) 1;
* Open the Script Editor by clicking on the icon in the right bottom of the screen.
* Paste the above script into the Script Editor, select it again by pressing CTRL+A.
* Open the &quot;Custom&quot; tab on the top shelve. (If you don't have one, create a new one, Go to Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Shelves...)
* Now go back to the Script Editor and drag the selected script into the &quot;Custom&quot; tab area - a new button appears.
* You can (but it is not necessary) make a nice icon for this button, so you can recognize it better later, or just because it looks nice.
** Go to Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Shelves...
** You will see something like this: [[Image:Maya-shelves-editor.png|none|]]
** First download this icon: http://www.extrapuur.nl/SWCLEANUP.bmp [[Image:SWCLEANUP.png]] (make sure you download the bmp, not the png hosted here on wikibooks!)
** Click the &quot;Change Image...&quot; button and locate the icon you just downloaded.
** Hit close and VOILA! There you have your very own SW-cleanup button!

* Now you can finally cleanup your scene: simply press the button you just created. This button will still be there the next time you start Maya, so it'll be much faster next time. '''important note: If you imported a part model and not an assembly, you won't have duplicate geometry, and you don't have to cleanup the scene either!'''

If everything has gone well, you will now have a clean version of your SolidWorks model in Maya. Time to save!
* Go to File &gt; Save Scene As...
* Enter an appropriate name for your file and hit &quot;Save&quot;.

== Creating an HDRI environment ==
Because the aim of this how-to is to get you started on photorealistic rendering, we will be using an [[w:HDRI|HDRI]] environment. HDRI stands for High Dynamic Range Imaging, and is basically a technique to use a picture of the environment for lighting your scene. This will result in very realistic and convincing shadows, higlights and reflections. This is very important for realistic emulation of chrome for example.

First of all, you'll need an HDR image. There is a whole range at http://debevec.org/Probes/ that you can download for free. I will use the [http://debevec.org/Probes/uffizi_probe.hdr Uffizi Gallery probe], but any other HDR image will do just fine.

Since maya 6.0 there's a special IBL node that you can create within mental ray. We will use this node to create the Image Based Lighting (IBL) within the scene.
to create this node:
* Go to Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Render Globals... ('Render Settings...' in Maya 7.0)
* Select &quot;mental ray&quot; in the &quot;Render Using&quot; drop down menu.
** If there is no mental ray in that menu, you need to turn it on. To do this, go to Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Plug-in Manager.
** Scroll down to Mayatomr.mll, and tick both boxes behind it. Now Maya will load mental ray by default when you start Maya.
* Now go to the mental ray tab.
* Scroll down until you see &quot;Image Based Lighting&quot;, open it and hit the &quot;Create&quot; button.
* A new settings window will appear in the right of the main screen (this area is called the Attribute Editor).

What we'll do next will appear to be double work (selecting the same image twice), but this way you can see your environment within your scene and still be able to adjust it.
* Set the &quot;Mapping&quot; option to &quot;Angular&quot;
* Click on the folder icon next to the &quot;Image Name&quot; field and locate the HDR image you just downloaded.
* Now change the &quot;Type&quot; option to &quot;Texture&quot; and click on the checkered icon next to the &quot;Texture&quot; option.
* A new window will pop up called &quot;Create Render Node&quot;. In the &quot;2D Textures&quot;-section, select &quot;File&quot;.
* Again, click the folder icon next to the &quot;Image Name&quot; field and locate the (same) HDR image.

We're now going to make a network to be able to adjust the gamma of the image. We need to do this because most HDR images are set at 1 (or at least read that way in Maya), and it should be around 2.

* With the texture file tab still open, go to Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Hypershade...
* A new window will appear. Click twice on the [[Image:Maya-hypershade-inputoutput.png]] button.
* You will now see how the texture is connected to the mental ray IBL node in the bottom of this window: [[Image:Maya-hypershade-probe-connections.png|none|500px]]
* Now go to Create &gt; Color Utilities &gt; Gamma Correct
* Drag the gamma node to a convenient location, so that you can still see the &quot;file1&quot; node, and the &quot;mentalrayIblShape1&quot; node; preferably between these two. You can zoom / pan in the views with the standard camera controls.
* Select the &quot;out&quot;-arrow at the right bottom of the &quot;file1&quot;-node, keep pressing it and go to outColor &gt; outColor.
* Click on the &quot;in&quot;-arrow on the left bottom of the gamma node and select value. You have connected the &quot;file1&quot; and the &quot;gammaCorrect1&quot; nodes with a green line.
* Connect the outValue of the &quot;gammaCorrect1&quot; node (outValue &gt; outValue) with the color of the &quot;mentalrayIbleShape1&quot; node in the same way. If you have done everything as described, you should see something that is connected like this: [[Image:Maya-nodes-connectedexample.png|none|500px]]

Now you can adjust the gamma of the HDR image. If you don't do this, your renders will be extremely bright in most cases.
* Click on the gamma node to select it. The properties open in the Attribute Editor (in the main Maya screen).
* Set all three gamma values to 2.2

Normally a gamma of 2.2 will do fine, but if you still think it is too bright (or even too dark) after you render the scene (we'll get to that later) you can always go back to this node and adjust the values: a higher value means &quot;darker&quot;, and a lower value means &quot;lighter&quot;.

As a final step in this part, you need to turn off the default light. This is because Maya places a light in the scene if there isn't already one. Apparently Maya doesn't recognize our IBL-node as a light, so you have to turn it off manually - otherwise your scene will be overexposed.
* Go to the Render Globals window
* Select the &quot;Common&quot; tab.
* Turn off &quot;Enable Default Light&quot; at the bottom of this window (you may need to scroll down).

== Assigning materials ==
We've now imported the SolidWorks model into Maya and set up an environment for it, so we're ready to assign materials to our model. It will not go into deep detail of how exactly you should tune your shaders - that's beyond the scope of this how-to - but it will provide you with a good basis to start from.

Right now, your model doesn't have any materials assigned to it, so when you render it, it won't be visible. Because it's more convenient if you can see the complete model when you test-render, we'll assign a temporary, bright and shiny material to the complete model. We'll also create a plane for the model to lay on.

* Make sure you're in &quot;shaded&quot; mode, by pressing 6 in the viewport.
* Go to Create &gt; NURBS primitives &gt; Plane, or click the plane button in the Surfaces tab.
* Scale this plane (by pressing r on your keyboard or clicking the scale button) to a size that fits your model.
* Open the Hypershade (Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Hypershade...)
* Press the &quot;Blinn&quot; button in the left of this window. (Make sure you are in Create Maya nodes, not mental ray nodes) You've just created a new material.
* Click on this node to open it's properties, and drag the color slider to the right to make it brighter (not completely white).
* Now select all the geometry from your model by opening the Outliner (Window &gt; Outliner...), selecting the first group of geomtry and SHIFT selecting the last group:[[Image:Maya-selected-all-geometry-outliner.png|none|150px]]
* Go back to the Hypershade and right click your Blinn material. Hold your mouse-button down and go to &quot;Assign Material To Selection&quot;.

We're now going to make a first test render, to see if everything has gone well.
* First create a resolution gate for your viewport, so you can see what area is going to be rendered. Go to View &gt; Camera Settings &gt; Resolution Gate in the viewport menu.
* Zoom in to a nice view on your model.
* Go to the Render Globals window (Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Render Globals...)
* In the mental ray tab, turn on &quot;Final Gather&quot; (only the first checkbox). We'll leave these settings for what they are now.
* Now you can render! Hit the render-button, or go to Render &gt; Render Current Frame...
* This is how my render looks: [[Image:Maya-lighter-first-render.jpg|none]]

===Plastic===
The first material we'll create will be plain plastic. We'll apply this material to the middle part, the gas regulator and the push button.
Whenever you're going to create a new material, think of it in terms of how much it should reflect, how much it diffuses light, how transparant it is etc. because these are your parameters within Maya.
[[Image:Maya-blinn-black-plastic.png|right|200px]]To create the plastic material:
* Open the Hypershade window.
* Create a Blinn material just like you did before. Blinn differs from Lambert for example (which is the standard material in Maya) that it has a reflectivity parameter.
* Set the Color to black (not completely! set the slider at about 5%).
* Set the Eccentricity to 0.175
* Set the Specular Roll Off to 1.000
* Set the Specular Color to 100% white
* Set the Reflectivity to 0.400
If you're not sure about the settings, you can look at the picture beside this text on the right.
You have now created a material that is a bit reflective, but with sharp, bright highlights. I strongly encourage you to play with these settings, and those of other materials; it will learn you what parameters you need to quickly set the material/look you are after.
To apply this material to the middle part, the gas regulator and the push button, select these first. Normally these would be easy to recognise in the outliner (Window &gt; Outliner...), because they get the same name you gave them in Solidworks. In this example (the lighter), the creator of that assembly didn't give names to the parts, so you'll have to browse through the Outliner. '''Watch out!''' If you select the parts in the viewport, there's a big chance you'll miss some faces, so in most cases you should use the Outliner for selecting.
In this case it's Part020, Part017, Part013 &amp; Part015. Use CTRL click to select all of these together.
Now go back to the Hypershade, right click on your new black material and drag your mouse to &quot;Assign Material To Selection&quot;.

===Transparent plastic===
[[Image:Maya-phong-transparent-orange-plastic.png|right|200px]]For the fuel part, we'll assign a nice orange transparant material.
* Open the Hypershade window.
* Create a Phong material.
* Double click on the gray Color field in the Attribute Editor.
* A new color window opens. Select a color you like; I chose the brightest orange, but if you're more into green, just choose that!
* Set the Transparency to about 60-70%
* Set the Diffuse to 1.000
* Set the Reflectivity to 0.400
Assign the material to Part016 in the Outliner. As you can see in the viewport, the color of that part has changed.

===Chrome===
[[Image:Maya-phong-chrome.png|right|200px]]The metal part needs to be nice &amp; shiny, so we'll make a chrome-like material for that.
* Again, go to the Hypershade
* Create a Phong material.
* Set the Cosine Power to 5.000
* Set the Specular Color to 100% white
* Set the reflectivity to 1.000
Assign this material to the metal part - Part014 in the Outliner.
Chrome is quite a difficult material to make, because you're all dependent from you're environment - it's nearly &quot;all&quot; reflections. Because we have the HDR environment, that problem is not so big anymore, but to make it more convincing, it would need more reflections from things that are closer to the lighter. It could be the table it's lying on or the person that is watching it. Right now it's lying in an empty street on a completely homogenic plane. Anyway, you can check the results, I think this looks quite realistic already. You really need to experiment with the settings for each material to make it work, and if you really want realistic images, you would probably want to apply a texture to the plane it's lying on.

===Wood Texture===
As stated before, to make it make the lighter more realistic, it needs a realistic environment. We already made part of this environment with the HDR-image, but to make it even more convincing, we're going to turn the ground-plane into a realistic looking table.
We need an image of wood to apply to the plane. I'll use one from [http://www.mayang.com/textures/Nature/html/Plants%20and%20Derived%20Materials/Wood/Manufactured%20Items/index.html Mayang's Free Texture Library], called &quot;parallel wooden planks&quot;.
* In the Hypershade, select the &quot;Lambert1&quot; material
* Go to the Attribute editor and click on the checkered icon next to the &quot;Color&quot; option.
* Choose &quot;File&quot; and load your texture into the &quot;Image Name&quot; field (click on the folder icon)
* You can now see a preview of the texture in your viewport (if not, press 6 while in the viewport)
* In my case, the lighter was not really fortunate positioned, so I selected everything in the outliner and dragged the lighter a bit back

If you render now, you will see it has become quite realistic! Tune your materials a bit more and tweak your mental ray settings, and no-one will be able to tell it from real.

== Setting up mental ray ==
In general, setting mental ray's render quality to a lower quality level is appropriate while you are tweaking your materials, changing camera angles, and any other process that may require repeatedly rendering your scene.  But when you are relatively satisfied with how it looks you can then switch your mental ray settings to a level appropriate for production rendering:
* Either click the render settings button (black clapperboard icon with the two radio buttons) or go to: Render &gt; Render Current Frame &gt; []
* On the &quot;Quality&quot; tab, change the quality preset dropdown to &quot;Production&quot;
* On the &quot;Indirect Lighting&quot; tab, under the &quot;Final Gathering&quot; heading, check the box to enable Final Gathering
* The default accuracy of 100 is usually insufficient.  Raising this to 256 is usually a good place to start
* If, at 256, you are getting spotty artifacts in your render, try raising the point interpolation to 30
* If you have multiple layers of transparent geometry, it may be necessary to raise the reflection, refractions, and trace depth under &quot;Final Gathering Tracing&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rene Descartes (1596-1650)==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes Descartes] was also known as Cartesius. He had an empirical approach to consciousness and the mind, describing in his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (1641) what it is like to be human. His idea of perception is summarised in the diagram below.

[[Image:Constuddescart3.png]]

===Dubitability===

Descartes is probably most famous for his statement: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Descartes is clear that what he means by ''thought'' is all the things that occur in experience, whether dreams, sensations, symbols etc.:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;5. Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think [ represent to my mind ] a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God. Others, again, have certain other forms; as when I will, fear, affirm, or deny, I always, indeed, apprehend something as the object of my thought, but I also embrace in thought something more than the representation of the object; and of this class of thoughts some are called volitions or affections, and others judgments.&quot; (Meditation III).&lt;/font&gt;

He repeats this general description of thought in many places in the Meditations and elsewhere. What Descartes is saying is that his meditator has thoughts; that there are thoughts and this cannot be doubted when and where they occur (Russell (1945) makes this clear).

Needless to say the basic ''cogito'' put forward by Descartes has provoked endless debate, much of it based on the false premise that Descartes was presenting an inference or argument rather than just saying that thought certainly exists. However, the extent to which the philosopher can go beyond this certainty to concepts such as God, science or the soul is highly problematical.

===The description of thoughts and mind===

[[Image:Descartes2.jpg|thumb|left|Descartes]]Descartes uses the words &quot;ideas&quot; and &quot;imagination&quot; in a rather unusual fashion. The word &quot;idea&quot; he defines as follows:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;5. Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think [ represent to my mind ] a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God.&quot; (Meditation III).&lt;/font&gt; 

As will be seen later, Descartes regards his mind as an unextended thing (a point) so &quot;images of things&quot; or &quot;IDEAS&quot; require some way of being extended. In the ''Treatise on Man'' (see below) he is explicit that ideas are extended things in the brain, on the surface of the &quot;common sense&quot;. In ''Rules for the Direction of the Mind'' he notes that we &quot;receive ideas from the common sensibility&quot;, an extended part of the brain. This usage of the term &quot;ideas&quot; is very strange to the modern reader and the source of many mistaken interpretations. It should be noted that occasionally Descartes uses the term 'idea' according to its usual meaning where it is almost interchangeable with 'thought' in general but usually he means a representation laid out in the brain.

Descartes considers the imagination to be the way that the mind &quot;turns towards the body&quot; (by which Descartes means the part of the brain in the body called the senses communis):

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;3. I remark, besides, that this power of imagination which I possess, in as far as it differs from the power of conceiving, is in no way necessary to my [nature or] essence, that is, to the essence of my mind; for although I did not possess it, I should still remain the same that I now am, from which it seems we may conclude that it depends on something different from the mind. And I easily understand that, if some body exists, with which my mind is so conjoined and united as to be able, as it were, to consider it when it chooses, it may thus imagine corporeal objects; so that this mode of thinking differs from pure intellection only in this respect, that the mind in conceiving turns in some way upon itself, and considers some one of the ideas it possesses within itself; but in imagining it turns toward the body, and contemplates in it some object conformed to the idea which it either of itself conceived or apprehended by sense.&quot; Meditations VI &lt;/font&gt;

So ideas, where they become imagined images of things were thought by Descartes to involve a phase of creating a form in the brain.

Descartes gives a clear description of his experience as a container that allows length, breadth, depth, continuity and time with contents arranged within it:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;2. But before considering whether such objects as I conceive exist without me, I must examine their ideas in so far as these are to be found in my consciousness, and discover which of them are distinct and which confused.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;3. In the first place, I distinctly imagine that quantity which the philosophers commonly call continuous, or the extension in length, breadth, and depth that is in this quantity, or rather in the object to which it is attributed. Further, I can enumerate in it many diverse parts, and attribute to each of these all sorts of sizes, figures, situations, and local motions; and, in fine, I can assign to each of these motions all degrees of duration.&quot;(Meditation V).&lt;/font&gt;

He points out that sensation occurs by way of the brain, conceptualising the brain as the place in the body where the extended experiences are found : Meditations VI:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;20. I remark, in the next place, that the mind does not immediately receive the impression from all the parts of the body, but only from the brain, or perhaps even from one small part of it, viz., that in which the common sense (senses communis) is said to be, which as often as it is affected in the same way gives rise to the same perception in the mind, although meanwhile the other parts of the body may be diversely disposed, as is proved by innumerable experiments, which it is unnecessary here to enumerate.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

He finds that both imaginings and perceptions are extended things and hence in the (brain part) of the body. The area of extended things is called the ''res extensa'', it includes the brain, body and world beyond. He also considers the origin of intuitions, suggesting that they can enter the mind without being consciously created: Meditations VI, 10 :

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;10. Moreover, I find in myself diverse faculties of thinking that have each their special mode: for example, I find I possess the faculties of imagining and perceiving, without which I can indeed clearly and distinctly conceive myself as entire, but I cannot reciprocally conceive them without conceiving myself, that is to say, without an intelligent substance in which they reside, for [in the notion we have of them, or to use the terms of the schools] in their formal concept, they comprise some sort of intellection; whence I perceive that they are distinct from myself as modes are from things. I remark likewise certain other faculties, as the power of changing place, of assuming diverse figures, and the like, that cannot be conceived and cannot therefore exist, any more than the preceding, apart from a substance in which they inhere. It is very evident, however, that these faculties, if they really exist, must belong to some corporeal or extended substance, since in their clear and distinct concept there is contained some sort of extension, but no intellection at all. Further, I cannot doubt but that there is in me a certain passive faculty of perception, that is, of receiving and taking knowledge of the ideas of sensible things; but this would be useless to me, if there did not also exist in me, or in some other thing, another active faculty capable of forming and producing those ideas. But this active faculty cannot be in me [in as far as I am but a thinking thing], seeing that it does not presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are frequently produced in my mind without my contributing to it in any way, and even frequently contrary to my will. This faculty must therefore exist in some substance different from me, in which all the objective reality of the ideas that are produced by this faculty is contained formally or eminently, as I before remarked; and this substance is either a body, that is to say, a corporeal nature in which is contained formally [and in effect] all that is objectively [and by representation] in those ideas; or it is God himself, or some other creature, of a rank superior to body, in which the same is contained eminently. But as God is no deceiver, it is manifest that he does not of himself and immediately communicate those ideas to me, nor even by the intervention of any creature in which their objective reality is not formally, but only eminently, contained. For as he has given me no faculty whereby I can discover this to be the case, but, on the contrary, a very strong inclination to believe that those ideas arise from corporeal objects, I do not see how he could be vindicated from the charge of deceit, if in truth they proceeded from any other source, or were produced by other causes than corporeal things: and accordingly it must be concluded, that corporeal objects exist. Nevertheless, they are not perhaps exactly such as we perceive by the senses, for their comprehension by the senses is, in many instances, very obscure and confused; but it is at least necessary to admit that all which I clearly and distinctly conceive as in them, that is, generally speaking all that is comprehended in the object of speculative geometry, really exists external to me. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He considers that the mind itself is the thing that generates thoughts and is not extended (occupies no space). This 'mind' is known as the ''res cogitans''. The mind works on the imaginings and perceptions that exist in that part of the body called the brain. This is Descartes' dualism: it is the proposition that there is an unextended place called the mind that acts upon the extended things in the brain. Meditations VI, 9:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;... And although I may, or rather, as I will shortly say, although I certainly do possess a body with which I am very closely conjoined; nevertheless, because, on the one hand, I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in as far as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as, on the other hand, I possess a distinct idea of body, in as far as it is only an extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that I, [that is, my mind, by which I am what I am], is entirely and truly distinct from my body, and may exist without it.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Notice that the intellection associated with ideas is part of an &quot;active faculty capable of forming and producing those ideas&quot; that has a &quot;corporeal nature&quot; (it is in the brain). This suggests that the &quot;thinking&quot; in the passage above applies only to those thoughts that are unextended, however, it is difficult to find a definition of these particular thoughts. 

&quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot; demonstrates Descartes' dualism. He describes the brain as the part of the body that contains images or phantasies of the world but believes that there is a further, spiritual mind that processes the images in the brain:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;My fourth supposition is that the power of movement, in fact the nerves, originate in the brain, where the phantasy is seated; and that the phantasy moves them in various ways, as the external sense &lt;organ&gt; moves the &lt;organ of&gt; common sensibility, or as the whole pen is moved by its tip. This illustration also shows how it is that the phantasy can cause various movements in the nerves, although it has not images of these formed in itself, but certain other images, of which these movements are possible effects. For the pen as a whole does not move in the same way as its tip; indeed, the greater part of the pen seems to go along with an altogether different, contrary motion. This enables us to understand how the movements of all other animals are accomplished, although we suppose them to have no consciousness (rerum cognitio) but only a bodily &lt;organ of&gt; phantasy; and furthermore, how it is that in ourselves those operations are performed which occur without any aid of reason.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;My fifth and last supposition is that the power of cognition properly so called is purely spiritual, and is just as distinct from the body as a whole as blood is from bone or a hand from an eye; and that it is a single power. Sometimes it receives images from the common sensibility at the same time as the phantasy does; sometimes it applies itself to the images preserved in memory; sometimes it forms new images, and these so occupy the imagination that often it is not able at the same time to receive ideas from the common sensibility, or to pass them on to the locomotive power in the way that the body left to itself -would. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Descartes sums up his concept of a point soul seeing forms in the world via forms in the sensus communis in ''Passions of the Soul'', 35:

&quot;By this means the two images which are in the brain form but one upon the gland, which, acting immediately upon the soul, causes it to see the form in the mind&quot;.

===Anatomical and physiological ideas===

In his ''Treatise on Man'' Descartes summarises his ideas on how we perceive and react to things as well as how consciousness is achieved anatomically and physiologically. The 'Treatise' was written at a time when even galvanic electricity was unknown. The excerpt given below covers Descartes' analysis of perception and stimulus-response processing. 

[[Image:Constuddescart1.png]]

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt; &quot;Thus for example [in Fig 1], if fire A is close to foot B, the tiny parts of this fire (which, as you know, move about very rapidly) have the power also to move the area of skin which they touch. In this way they pull the tiny fibre ''cc'' which you see attached to it, and simultaneously open the entrance to the pore ''de'', located opposite the point where this fiber terminates - just as when you pull one end of a string, you cause a bell hanging at the other end to ring at the same time.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;When the entrance to the pore or small tube ''de'' is opened in this way, the animal spirits from cavity F enter and are carried through it - some to muscles which serve to pull the foot away from the fire, some to muscles which turn the eyes and head to look at it, and some to muscles which make the hands move and the whole body turn in order to protect it.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Now I maintain that when God unites a rational soul to this machine (in a way that I intend to explain later) he will place its principle seat in the brain, and will make its nature such that the soul will have different sensations corresponding to the different ways in which the entrances to the pores in the internal surface of the brain are opened by means of nerves.&lt;/font&gt;

[[Image:Constuddescart2.png]]

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;In order to see clearly how ideas are formed of the objects which strike the senses, observe in this diagram [fig 2] the tiny fibres 12, 34, 56, and the like, which make up the optic nerve and stretch from the back of the eye at 1, 3, 5 to the internal surface of the brain at 2, 4, 6. Now assume that these fibres are so arranged that if the rays coming, for example, from point A of the object happen to press upon the back of the eye at point 1, they pull the whole of fibre 12 and enlarge the opening of the tiny tube marked 2. In the same way, the rays which come from point B enlarge the opening of the tiny tube 4, and likewise for the others. We have already described how, depending on the different ways in which the points 1, 3, 5 are pressed by these rays, a figure is traced on the back of the eye corresponding to that of the object ABC. Similarly it is obvious that, depending on the different ways in which the tiny tubes 2, 4, 6 are opened by the fibres 12, 34, 56 etc., a corresponding figure must also be traced on the internal surface of the brain.&lt;/font&gt;

.....

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And note that by 'figures' I mean not only things which somehow represent the position of the edges and surfaces of objects, but also anything which, as I said above, can give the soul occasion to perceive movement, size, distance, colours, sounds, smells and other such qualities. And I also include anything that can make the soul feel pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, joy, sadness and other such passions.&lt;/font&gt;

...

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Now among these figures, it is not those imprinted on the external sense organs, or on the internal surface of the brain, which should be taken to be ideas - but only those which are traced in the spirits on the surface of gland H (''where the seat of the imagination and the 'common sense' is located''). That is to say, it is only the latter figures which should be taken to be the forms or images which the rational soul united to this machine will consider directly when it imagines some object or perceives it by the senses.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And note that I say 'imagines or perceives by the senses'. For I wish to apply the term 'idea' generally to all impressions which the spirits can receive as they leave gland H. These are to be attributed to the 'common' sense when they depend on the presence of objects; but they may also proceed from many other causes (as I shall explain later), and they should then be attributed to the imagination.
&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

The ''common sense'' is referred to by philosophers as the ''senses communis''. Descartes considered this to be the place where all the sensations were bound together and proposed the pineal gland for this role. This was in the days before the concept of 'dominance' of parts of the brain had been developed so Descartes reasoned that only a single organ could host a bound representation.

Notice how Descartes is explicit about ideas being '''traced in the spirits on the surface of the gland'''. Notice also how the rational soul will consider forms on the common sense '''directly'''. 

Descartes believed that animals are not conscious because, although he thought they possessed the stimulus-response loop in the same way as humans he believed that they do not possess a soul.

==John Locke (1632-1704)==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke Locke's] most important philosophical work on the human mind was &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; written in 1689. His idea of perception is summarised in the diagram below:

[[Image:Constudlocke1.png]]

Locke is an Indirect Realist, admitting of external objects but describing these as represented within the mind. The objects themselves are thought to have a form and properties that are the ''archetype'' of the object and these give rise in the brain and mind to derived copies called ''ektypa''.

Like Descartes, he believes that people have souls that produce thoughts. 
Locke considers that sensations make their way from the senses to the brain where they are laid out for understanding as a 'view':

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And if these organs, or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brain,- the mind's presence-room (as I may so call it)- are any of them so disordered as not to perform their functions, they have no postern to be admitted by; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be perceived by the understanding.&quot; (Chapter III, 1).&lt;/font&gt;

He considers that what is sensed becomes a mental thing: Chapter IX: Of Perception paragraph 1: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;This is certain, that whatever alterations are made in the body, if they reach not the mind; whatever impressions are made on the outward parts, if they are not taken notice of within, there is no perception. Fire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it does a billet, unless the motion be continued to the brain, and there the sense of heat, or idea of pain, be produced in the mind; wherein consists actual perception. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

[[Image:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|Locke]]Locke calls the contents of consciousness &quot;ideas&quot; (cf: Descartes, Malebranche) and regards sensation, imagination etc. as being similar or even alike. Chapter I: Of Ideas in general, and their Original:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;1. Idea is the object of thinking. Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks; and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the ideas that are there, it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,- such as are those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others: it is in the first place then to be inquired, How he comes by them? &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;I know it is a received doctrine, that men have native ideas, and original characters, stamped upon their minds in their very first being. This opinion I have at large examined already; and, I suppose what I have said in the foregoing Book will be much more easily admitted, when I have shown whence the understanding may get all the ideas it has; and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mind;- for which I shall appeal to every one's own observation and experience. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;2. All ideas come from sensation or reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:- How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either, about external sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that which supplies our understandings with all the materials of thinking. These two are the fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas we have, or can naturally have, do spring. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;3. The objects of sensation one source of ideas. First, our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. And thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions. This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call SENSATION.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;4. The operations of our minds, the other source of them. Secondly, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,- the perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;- which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds;- which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I call the other SENSATION, so I Call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz. external material things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the operations of our own minds within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings. The term operations here I use in a large sense, as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;5. All our ideas are of the one or the other of these. The understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of any ideas which it doth not receive from one of these two. External objects furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities, which are all those different perceptions they produce in us; and the mind furnishes the understanding with ideas of its own operations. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He calls ideas that come directly from the senses ''primary qualities'' and those that come from reflection upon these he calls ''secondary qualities'':

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;9. Primary qualities of bodies. Qualities thus considered in bodies are, 
First, such as are utterly inseparable from the body, in what state soever it be; and such as in all the alterations and changes it suffers, all the force can be used upon it, it constantly keeps; and such as sense constantly finds in every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and the mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less than to make itself singly be perceived by our senses:  .......... These I call original or primary qualities of body, which I think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us, viz. solidity, extension, figure, motion or rest, and number.
10. Secondary qualities of bodies. Secondly, such qualities which in truth are nothing in the objects themselves but power to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities.....&quot; (Chapter VIII).&lt;/font&gt;

He gives examples of secondary qualities:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;13. How secondary qualities produce their ideas. After the same manner, that the ideas of these original qualities are produced in us, we may conceive that the ideas of secondary qualities are also produced, viz. by the operation of insensible particles on our senses. .....v.g. that a violet, by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter, of peculiar figures and bulks, and in different degrees and modifications of their motions, causes the ideas of the blue colour, and sweet scent of that flower to be produced in our minds. It being no more impossible to conceive that God should annex such ideas to such motions, with which they have no similitude, than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel dividing our flesh, with which that idea hath no resemblance.&quot; (Chapter VIII).&lt;/font&gt;

He argues against all conscious experience being in mental space (does not consider that taste might be on the tongue or a smell come from a cheese): Chapter XIII: Complex Ideas of Simple Modes:- and First, of the Simple Modes of the Idea of Space - paragraph 25:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;I shall not now argue with those men, who take the measure and possibility of all being only from their narrow and gross imaginations: but having here to do only with those who conclude the essence of body to be extension, because they say they cannot imagine any sensible quality of any body without extension,- I shall desire them to consider, that, had they reflected on their ideas of tastes and smells as much as on those of sight and touch; nay, had they examined their ideas of hunger and thirst, and several other pains, they would have found that they included in them no idea of extension at all, which is but an affection of body, as well as the rest, discoverable by our senses, which are scarce acute enough to look into the pure essences of things.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; 

Locke understood the &quot;specious&quot; or extended present but conflates this with longer periods of time: Chapter XIV. Idea of Duration and its Simple Modes - paragraph 1: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Duration is fleeting extension. There is another sort of distance, or length, the idea whereof we get not from the permanent parts of space, but from the fleeting and perpetually perishing parts of succession. This we call duration; the simple modes whereof are any different lengths of it whereof we have distinct ideas, as hours, days, years, &amp;c., time and eternity.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

Locke is uncertain about whether extended ideas are viewed from an unextended soul.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;He that considers how hardly sensation is, in our thoughts, reconcilable to extended matter; or existence to anything that has no extension at all, will confess that he is very far from certainly knowing what his soul is. It is a point which seems to me to be put out of the reach of our knowledge: and he who will give himself leave to consider freely, and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis, will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the soul's materiality. Since, on which side soever he views it, either as an unextended substance, or as a thinking extended matter, the difficulty to conceive either will, whilst either alone is in his thoughts, still drive him to the contrary side.&quot;(Chapter III, 6).&lt;/font&gt;

==David Hume (1711-1776)==

'''Hume (1739-40). A Treatise of Human Nature: Being An Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning Into Moral Subjects.'''
http://www.class.uidaho.edu/mickelsen/ToC/hume%20treatise%20ToC.htm

[[Image:David_Hume.jpg|thumb|left|Hume]]Hume represents a type of pure empiricism where certainty is only assigned to present experience. As we can only directly know the mind he works within this constraint. He admits that there can be consistent bodies of knowledge within experience and would probably regard himself as an Indirect Realist but with the caveat that the things that are inferred to be outside the mind, in the physical world, could be no more than inferences within the mind.

Hume has a clear concept of mental space and time that is informed by the senses:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The idea of space is convey'd to the mind by two senses, the sight and touch; nor does anything ever appear extended, that is not either visible or tangible. That compound impression, which represents extension, consists of several lesser impressions, that are indivisible to the eye or feeling, and may be call'd impressions of atoms or corpuscles endow'd with colour and solidity. But this is not all. 'Tis not only requisite, that these atoms shou'd be colour'd or tangible, in order to discover themselves to our senses; 'tis also necessary we shou'd preserve the idea of their colour or tangibility in order to comprehend them by our imagination. There is nothing but the idea of their colour or tangibility, which can render them conceivable by the mind. Upon the removal of the ideas of these sensible qualities, they are utterly annihilated to the thought or imagination.'&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Now such as the parts are, such is the whole. If a point be not consider'd as colour'd or tangible, it can convey to us no idea; and consequently the idea of extension, which is compos'd of the ideas of these points, can never possibly exist. But if the idea of extension really can exist, as we are conscious it does, its parts must also exist; and in order to that, must be consider'd as colour'd or tangible. We have therefore no idea of space or extension, but when we regard it as an object either of our sight or feeling.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;The same reasoning will prove, that the indivisible moments of time must be fill'd with some real object or existence, whose succession forms the duration, and makes it be conceivable by the mind.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In common with Locke and Eastern Philosophy, Hume considers reflection and sensation to be similar, perhaps identical:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Thus it appears, that the belief or assent, which always attends the memory and senses, is nothing but the vivacity of those perceptions they present; and that this alone distinguishes them from the imagination. To believe is in this case to feel an immediate impression of the senses, or a repetition of that impression in the memory. 'Tis merely the force and liveliness of the perception, which constitutes the first act of the judgment, and lays the foundation of that reasoning, which we build upon it, when we trace the relation of cause and effect.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Hume considers that the origin of sensation can never be known, believing that the canvass of the mind contains our view of the world whatever the ultimate source of the images within the view and that we can construct consistent bodies of knowledge within these constraints:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;As to those impressions, which arise from the senses, their ultimate cause is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason, and 'twill always be impossible to decide with certainty, whether they arise immediately from the object, or are produc'd by the creative power of the mind, or are deriv'd from the author of our being. Nor is such a question any way material to our present purpose. We may draw inferences from the coherence of our perceptions, whether they be true or false; whether they represent nature justly, or be mere illusions of the senses.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

It may be possible to trace the origins of Jackson's Knowledge Argument in Hume's work:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot; Suppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be plac'd before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest; 'tis plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, said will be sensible, that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt the contiguous colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether 'tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade, tho' it had never been conveyed to him by his senses? I believe i here are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always derived from the correspondent impressions; tho' the instance is so particular and singular, that 'tis scarce worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

'''David Hume (1748) An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'''
http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/david_hume/human_understanding.html

Hume's view of Locke and Malebranche:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is utterly decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation: But the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his own age. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke shall be entirely forgotten.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He is clear about relational knowledge in space and time:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;13. .. But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty, we shall find, upon a nearer examination, that it is really confined within very narrow limits, and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience. When we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas, gold, and mountain, with which we were formerly acquainted.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

...

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;19. Though it be too obvious to escape observation, that different ideas are connected together; I do not find that any philosopher has attempted to enumerate or class all the principles of association; a subject, however, that seems worthy of curiosity. To me, there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas, namely, Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He is also clear that, although we experience the output of processes, we do not experience the processes themselves:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;29. It must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets, and has afforded us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities of objects; while she conceals from us those powers and principles on which the influence of those objects entirely depends. Our senses inform us of the colour, weight, and consistence of bread; but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that wonderful force or power, which would carry on a moving body for ever in a continued change of place, and which bodies never lose but by communicating it to others; of this we cannot form the most distant conception. ..&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;58. ... All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but never connected. And as we can have no idea of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment, the necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely without any meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings or common life. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Our idea of process is not a direct experience but seems to originate from remembering the repetition of events:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;59 ..It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by any one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances, different from every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar; except only, that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual attendant, and to believe that it will exist.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

==Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)==

[[Image:Immanuel_Kant_2.jpg|thumb|left|kant]]Kant's greatest work on the subject of consciousness and the mind is Critique of Pure Reason (1781). Kant describes his objective in this work as discovering the axioms (&quot;a priori concepts&quot;) and then the processes of 'understanding'.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P12 &quot;This enquiry, which is somewhat deeply grounded, has two sides. The one refers to the objects of pure understanding, and is intended to expound and render intelligible the objective validity of its a priori concepts. It is therefore essential to my purposes. The other seeks to investigate the pure understanding itself, its possibility and the cognitive faculties upon which it rests; and so deals with it in its subjective aspect. Although this latter exposition is of great importance for my chief purpose, it does not form an essential part of it. For the chief question is always simply this: - what and how much can the understanding and reason know apart from all experience?&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Kant's idea of perception and mind is summarised in the illustration below:

[[Image:Constudkant.png]]

'Experience' is simply accepted. Kant believes that the physical world exists but is not known directly:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 24 &quot;For we are brought to the conclusion that we can never transcend the limits of possible experience, though that is precisely what this science is concerned, above all else, to achieve. This situation yields, however, just the very experiment by which, indirectly, we are enabled to prove the truth of this first estimate of our a priori knowledge of reason, namely, that such knowledge has to do only with appearances, and must leave the thing in itself as indeed real per se, but as not known by us. &quot;&lt;/font&gt; 

Kant is clear about the form and content of conscious experience. He notes that we can only experience things that have appearance and 'form' - content and geometrical arrangement.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P65-66 &quot;IN whatever manner and by whatever means a mode of knowledge may relate to objects, intuition is that through which it is in immediate relation to them, and to which all thought as a means is directed. But intuition takes place only in so far as the object is given to us. This again is only possible, to man at least, in so far as the mind is affected in a certain way. The capacity (receptivity) for receiving representations through the mode in which we are affected by objects, is entitled sensibility. Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone yields us intuitions; they are thought through the understanding, and from the understanding arise concepts. But all thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us. The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as we are affected by it, is sensation. That intuition which is in relation to the object through sensation, is entitled empirical. The undetermined object of an empirical intuition is entitled appearance. That in the appearance which corresponds to sensation I term its matter; but that which so determines the manifold of appearance that it allows of being ordered in certain relations, I term the form of appearance. That in which alone the sensations can be posited and ordered in a certain form, cannot itself be sensation; and therefore, while the matter of all appearance is given to us a posteriori only, its form must lie ready for the sensations a priori in the mind, and so must allow of being considered apart from all sensation. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Furthermore he realises that experience exists without much content. That consciousness depends on form:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P66 &quot;The pure form of sensible intuitions in general, in which all the manifold of intuition is intuited in certain relations, must be found in the mind a priori. This pure form of sensibility may also itself be called pure intuition. Thus, if I take away from the representation of a body that which the understanding thinks in regard to it, substance, force, divisibility, etc. , and likewise what belongs to sensation, impenetrability, hardness, colour, etc. , something still remains over from this empirical intuition, namely, extension and figure. These belong to pure intuition, which, even without any actual object of the senses or of sensation, exists in the mind a priori as a mere form of sensibility. The science of all principles of a priori sensibility I call transcendental aesthetic.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Kant proposes that space exists in our experience and that experience could not exist without it (apodeictic means 'incontrovertible):

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 68 &quot;1. Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from outer experiences. For in order that certain sensations be referred to something outside me (that is, to something in another region of space from that in which I find myself), and similarly in order that I may be able to represent them as outside and alongside one another, and accordingly as not only different but as in different places, the representation of space must be presupposed. The representation of space cannot, therefore, be empirically obtained from the relations of outer appearance. On the contrary, this outer experience is itself possible at all only through that representation. 2. Space is a necessary a priori representation, which underlies all outer intuitions. We can never represent to ourselves the absence of space, though we can quite well think it as empty of objects. It must therefore be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances, and not as a determina- tion dependent upon them. It is an a priori representation, which necessarily underlies outer appearances. * 3. The apodeictic certainty of all geometrical propositions and the possibility of their a priori construction is grounded in this a priori necessity of space. .........&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He is equally clear about the necessity of time as part of experience but he has no clear exposition of the (specious present) extended present:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 74 &quot;1. Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not presupposed as underlying them a priori. Only on the presupposition of time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times (successively). They are connected with the appearances only as effects accidentally added by the particular constitution of the sense organs. Accordingly, they are not a priori representations, but are grounded in sensation, and, indeed, in the case of taste, even upon feeling (pleasure and pain), as an effect of sensation. Further, no one can have a priori a representation of a colour or of any taste; whereas, since space concerns only the pure form of intuition, and therefore involves no sensation whatsoever, and nothing empirical, all kinds and determinations of space can and must be represented a priori, if concepts of figures and of their relations are to arise. Through space alone is it possible that things should be outer objects to us. ..2. 3.. 4.. 5...&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Kant has a model of experience as a succession of 3D instants, based on conventional 18th century thinking, allowing his reason to overcome his observation. He says of time that:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 79 &quot; It is nothing but the form of our inner intuition. If we take away from our inner intuition the peculiar condition of our sensibility, the concept of time likewise vanishes; it does not inhere in the objects, but merely in the subject which intuits them. I can indeed say that my representations follow one another; but this is only to say that we are conscious of them as in a time sequence, that is, in conformity with the form of inner sense. Time is not, therefore, something in itself, nor is it an objective determination inherent in things.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This analysis is strange because if uses the geometric term &quot;form&quot; but then uses the processing term &quot;succession&quot;.

==Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) ==

[[Image:Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg|thumb|left|Leibniz]]Leibniz is one of the first to notice that there is a problem with the proposition that computational machines could be conscious:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;One is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles, that is, by figures and motions. In imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think, to sense, and to have perception, one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions, so that one could enter into it, just like into a windmill. Supposing this, one should, when visiting within it, find only parts pushing one another, and never anything by which to explain a perception. Thus it is in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine, that one must look for perception.&quot; Monadology, 17.&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz considered that the world was composed of &quot;monads&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' is meant 'without parts.' (Theod. 10.) &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;2. And there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form [figure] nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and, in a word, the elements of things. &quot; (Monadology 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

These monads are considered to be capable of perception through the meeting of things at a point:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;They cannot have shapes, because then they would have parts; and therefore one monad in itself, and at a moment, cannot be distinguished from another except by its internal qualities and actions; which can only be its ''perceptions'' (that is, the representations of the composite, or of what is external, in the simple), or its ''appetitions'' (its tending to move from one perception to another, that is), which are the principles of change. For the simplicity of a substance does not in any way rule out a multiplicity in the modifications which must exist together in one simple substance; and those modifications must consist in the variety of its relationships to things outside it - like the way in which in a ''centre'', or a ''point'', although it is completely simple, there are an infinity of angles formed which meet in it.&quot; (Principles of Nature and Grace 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz also describes this in his &quot;New System&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;It is only atoms of substance, that is to say real unities absolutely devoid of parts, that can be the sources of actions, and the absolute first principles of the composition of things, and as it were the ultimate elements in the analysis of substances &lt;substantial things&gt;.  They might be called ''metaphysical points''; they have ''something of the nature of life'' and a kind of ''perception'', and ''mathematical points'' are their ''point of view'' for expressing the universe.&quot;(New System (11) 1695).&lt;/font&gt;

Having identified perception with metaphysical points Leibniz realises that there is a problem connecting the points with the world (cf: epiphenomenalism):

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Having decided these things, I thought I had reached port, but when I set myself to think about the union of the soul with the body I was as it were carried back into the open sea. For I could find no way of explaining how the body can make something pass over into the soul or vice versa, or how one created substance can communicate with another.&quot;(New System (12) 1695).&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz devises a theory of &quot;pre-established harmony&quot; to overcome this epiphenomenalism. He discusses how two separate clocks could come to tell the same time and proposes that this could be due to mutual influence of one clock on the other (&quot;the way of influence&quot;), continual adjustment by a workman (&quot;the way of assistance&quot;) or by making the clocks so well that they are always in agreement (&quot;the way of pre-established agreement&quot; or harmony). He considers each of these alternatives for harmonising the perceptions with the world and concludes that only the third is viable:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Thus there remains only my theory, ''the way of pre-established harmony'', set up by a contrivance of divine foreknowledge, which formed each of these substances from the outset in so perfect, so regular, and so exact a manner, that merely by following out its own laws, which were given to it when it was brought into being, each substance is nevertheless in harmony with the other, just as if there were a mutual influence between them, or as if in addition to his general concurrence God were continually operating upon them. (Third Explanation of the New System (5), 1696).&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This means that he must explain how perceptions involving the world take place:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Because of the plenitude of the world everything is linked, and every body acts to a greater or lesser extent on every other body in proportion to distance, and is affected by it in return. It therefore follows that every monad is a living mirror, or a mirror endowed with internal activity, representing the universe in accordance with its own point of view, and as orderly as the universe itself. The perceptions of monads arise one out of another by the laws of appetite, or of the ''final causes of good and evil'' (which are prominent perceptions, orderly or disorderly), just as changes in bodies or in external phenomena arise one from another by the laws of ''efficient causes'', of motion that is. Thus there is perfect ''harmony'' between the perceptions of the monad and the motions of bodies, pre-established from the outset, between the system of efficient causes and that of final causes. And it is that harmony that the agreement or physical union between the soul and body consists, without either of them being able to change the laws of the other.&quot; (Principles of Nature and Grace (3) 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

The &quot;laws of appetite&quot; are defined as:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The action of the internal principle which brings about change, or the passage from one perception to another, can be called ''appetition''. In fact appetite cannot always attain in its entirety the whole of the perception towards which it tends, but it always obtains some part of it, and attains new perceptions. Monadology 15.&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz thought animals had souls but not minds:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;But ''true'' reasoning depends on necessary or eternal truths like those of logic, numbers, and geometry, which make indubitable connections between ideas, and conclusions which are inevitable. Animals in which such conclusions are never perceived are called ''brutes''; but those which recognise such necessary truths are what are rightly called ''rational animals'' and their souls are called ''minds''. (Principles of Nature and Grace (5) 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

Minds allow reflection and awareness:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And it is by the knowledge of necessary truths, and by the abstractions they involve, that we are raised to ''acts of reflection'', which make us aware of what we call ''myself'', and make us think of this or that thing as in ''ourselves''. And in this way, by thinking of ourselves, we think of being, of substance, of simples and composites, of the immaterial - and, by realising that what is limited in us is limitless in him, of God himself. And so these ''acts of reflection'' provide the principle objects of our reasonings.&quot; Monadology, 30.&lt;/font&gt;

==George Berkeley (1685 - 1753) ==
A Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowledge. 1710

http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/berkeley.html#treatise

[[Image:George_Berkeley_by_John_Smibert.jpg|thumb|left|Berkeley]]Berkeley introduces the Principles of Human Knowledge with a diatribe against abstract ideas. He uses the abstract ideas of animals as an example:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 9........The constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal are body, life, sense, and spontaneous motion. By body is meant body without any particular shape or figure, there being no one shape or figure common to all animals, without covering, either of hair, or feathers, or scales, &amp;c., nor yet naked: hair, feathers, scales, and nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular animals, and for that reason left out of the abstract idea. Upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walking, nor flying, nor creeping; it is nevertheless a motion, but what that motion is it is not easy to conceive. &lt;/font&gt;

He then declares that such abstractions cannot be imagined. He emphasises that ideas are &quot;represented to myself&quot; and have shape and colour:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 10. Whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas, they best can tell: for myself, I find indeed I have a faculty of imagining, or representing to myself, the ideas of those particular things I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing them. I can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or separated from the rest of the body. But then whatever hand or eye I imagine, it must have some particular shape and colour. Likewise the idea of man that I frame to myself must be either of a white, or a black, or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or a middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and which is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear; and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This concept of ideas as extended things, or representations,  is typical of the usage amongst philosophers in the 17th and 18th century and can cause confusion in modern readers. Berkeley considers that words that are used to describe classes of things in the abstract can only be conceived as particular cases:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 15... Thus, when I demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles, it is to be supposed that I have in view the universal idea of a triangle; which ought not to be understood as if I could frame an idea of a triangle which was neither equilateral, nor scalenon, nor equicrural; but only that the particular triangle I consider, whether of this or that sort it matters not, doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever, and is in that sense universal. All which seems very plain and not to include any difficulty in it.&lt;/font&gt; 

Intriguingly, he considers that language is used to directly excite emotions as well as to communicate ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 20. ... I entreat the reader to reflect with himself, and see if it doth not often happen, either in hearing or reading a discourse, that the passions of fear, love, hatred, admiration, disdain, and the like, arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain words, without any ideas coming between.&lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley considers that extension is a quality of mind:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;11. Again, great and small, swift and slow, are allowed to exist nowhere without the mind, being entirely relative, and changing as the frame or position of the organs of sense varies. The extension therefore which exists without the mind is neither great nor small, the motion neither swift nor slow, that is, they are nothing at all. But, say you, they are extension in general, and motion in general: thus we see how much the tenet of extended movable substances existing without the mind depends on the strange doctrine of abstract ideas.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

He notes that the rate at which things pass may be related to the mind:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;14..... Is it not as reasonable to say that motion is not without the mind, since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter, the motion, it is acknowledged, shall appear slower without any alteration in any external object? &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley raises the issue of whether objects exist without being perceived. He bases his argument on the concept of perception being the perceiving of &quot;our own ideas or sensations&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;4. It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects, have an existence, natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understanding. But, with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertained in the world, yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may, if I mistake not, perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction. For, what are the fore-mentioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived?&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He further explains this concept in terms of some Eternal Spirit allowing continued existence. Berkeley is clear that the contents of the mind have &quot;colour, figure, motion, smell, taste etc.&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;7. From what has been said it follows there is not any other Substance than Spirit, or that which perceives. But, for the fuller proof of this point, let it be considered the sensible qualities are colour, figure, motion, smell, taste, etc., i.e. the ideas perceived by sense. Now, for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a manifest contradiction, for to have an idea is all one as to perceive; that therefore wherein colour, figure, and the like qualities exist must perceive them; hence it is clear there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He elaborates the concept that there is no unthinking substance or substratum for ideas and all is mind:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;18. But, though it were possible that solid, figured, movable substances may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this? Either we must know it by sense or by reason. As for our senses, by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations, ideas, or those things that are immediately perceived by sense, call them what you will: but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind, or unperceived, like to those which are perceived. This the materialists themselves acknowledge. It remains therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things, it must be by reason, inferring their existence from what is immediately perceived by sense. But what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind, from what we perceive, since the very patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend there is any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas? I say it is granted on all hands (and what happens in dreams, phrensies, and the like, puts it beyond dispute) that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have now, though there were no bodies existing without resembling them. Hence, it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas; since it is granted they are produced sometimes, and might possibly be produced always in the same order, we see them in at present, without their concurrence. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

and stresses that there is no apparent connection between mind and the proposed material substrate of ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;19. But, though we might possibly have all our sensations without them, yet perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production, by supposing external bodies in their likeness rather than otherwise; and so it might be at least probable there are such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds. But neither can this be said; for, though we give the materialists their external bodies, they by their own confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas are produced; since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit, or how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the mind.   ..... &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley makes a crucial observation, that had also been noticed by Descartes, that ideas are passive:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;25. All our ideas, sensations, notions, or the things which we perceive, by whatsoever names they may be distinguished, are visibly inactive- there is nothing of power or agency included in them. So that one idea or object of thought cannot produce or make any alteration in another. To be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every part of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived: but whoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power or activity; there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be the cause of anything: neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly follows that extension, figure, and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles, must certainly be false. &lt;/font&gt;

He considers that &quot;the cause of ideas is an incorporeal active substance or Spirit (26)&quot;.

He summarises the concept of an Eternal Spirit that governs real things and a representational mind that copies the form of the world as follows:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;33. The ideas imprinted on the Senses by the Author of nature are called real things; and those excited in the imagination being less regular, vivid, and constant, are more properly termed ideas, or images of things, which they copy and represent. But then our sensations, be they never so vivid and distinct, are nevertheless ideas, that is, they exist in the mind, or are perceived by it, as truly as the ideas of its own framing. The ideas of Sense are allowed to have more reality in them, that is, to be more strong, orderly, and coherent than the creatures of the mind; but this is no argument that they exist without the mind. They are also less dependent on the spirit, or thinking substance which perceives them, in that they are excited by the will of another and more powerful spirit; yet still they are ideas, and certainly no idea, whether faint or strong, can exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it. &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley considers that the concept of distance is a concept in the mind and also that dreams can be compared directly with sensations:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;42. Thirdly, it will be objected that we see things actually without or at distance from us, and which consequently do not exist in the mind; it being absurd that those things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts. In answer to this, I desire it may be considered that in a dream we do oft perceive things as existing at a great distance off, and yet for all that, those things are acknowledged to have their existence only in the mind.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He considers that ideas can be extended without the mind being extended:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;49. Fifthly, it may perhaps be objected that if extension and figure exist only in the mind, it follows that the mind is extended and figured; since extension is a mode or attribute which (to speak with the schools) is predicated of the subject in which it exists. I answer, those qualities are in the mind only as they are perceived by it- that is, not by way of mode or attribute, but only by way of idea; and it no more follows the soul or mind is extended, because extension exists in it alone, than it does that it is red or blue, because those colours are on all hands acknowledged to exist in it, and nowhere else. As to what philosophers say of subject and mode, that seems very groundless and unintelligible. For instance, in this proposition &quot;a die is hard, extended, and square,&quot; they will have it that the word die denotes a subject or substance, distinct from the hardness, extension, and figure which are predicated of it, and in which they exist. This I cannot comprehend: to me a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things which are termed its modes or accidents. And, to say a die is hard, extended, and square is not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and supporting them, but only an explication of the meaning of the word die. &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley proposes that time is related to the succession of ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;98. For my own part, whenever I attempt to frame a simple idea of time, abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind, which flows uniformly and is participated by all beings, I am lost and embrangled in inextricable difficulties. I have no notion of it at all, only I hear others say it is infinitely divisible, and speak of it in such a manner as leads me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence; since that doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of thinking, either that he passes away innumerable ages without a thought, or else that he is annihilated every moment of his life, both which seem equally absurd. Time therefore being nothing, abstracted from the succession of ideas in our minds, it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each other in that same spirit or mind. Hence, it is a plain consequence that the soul always thinks; and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts, or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation, will, I believe, find it no easy task. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;99. So likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities, and consider them by themselves, we presently lose sight of them, and run into great extravagances. All which depend on a twofold abstraction; first, it is supposed that extension, for example, may be abstracted from all other sensible qualities; and secondly, that the entity of extension may be abstracted from its being perceived. But, whoever shall reflect, and take care to understand what he says, will, if I mistake not, acknowledge that all sensible qualities are alike sensations and alike real; that where the extension is, there is the colour, too, i.e., in his mind, and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind; and that the objects of sense are nothing but those sensations combined, blended, or (if one may so speak) concreted together; none of all which can be supposed to exist unperceived.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

He regards &quot;spirit&quot; as something separate from ideas and attempts to answer the charge that as spirit is not an idea it cannot be known:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;139. But it will be objected that, if there is no idea signified by the terms soul, spirit, and substance, they are wholly insignificant, or have no meaning in them. I answer, those words do mean or signify a real thing, which is neither an idea nor like an idea, but that which perceives ideas, and wills, and reasons about them. ....&lt;/font&gt;

==Thomas Reid (1710-1796)==

[[Image:ThomasReid.jpg|thumb|left|Reid]]Thomas Reid is generally regarded as the founder of Direct Realism. Reid was a Presbyterian minister for the living of Newmachar near Aberdeen from 1737.  He is explicit about the 'directness' of his realism:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;It is therefore acknowledged by this philosopher to be a natural instinct or prepossession, a universal and primary opinion of all men, a primary instinct of nature, that the objects which we immediately perceive by our senses are not images in our minds, but external objects, and that their existence is independent of us and our perception. (Thomas Reid Essays, 14)&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In common with Descartes and Malebranche, Reid considers that the mind itself is an unextended thing:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;.. I take it for granted, upon the testimony of common sense, that my mind is a substance-that is, a permanent subject of thought; and my reason convinces me that it is an unextended and invisible substance; and hence I infer that there cannot be in it anything that resembles extension (Inquiry)&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;

Reid is also anxious to equate the unextended mind with the soul:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The soul, without being present to the images of the things perceived, could not possibly perceive them. A living substance can only there perceive, where it is present, either to the things themselves, (as the omnipresent God is to the whole universe,) or to the images of things, as the soul is in its proper sensorium.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Reid's Direct Realism is therefore the idea that the physical objects in the world are in some way presented directly to a soul. This approach is known as &quot;Natural Dualism&quot;.

Reid's views show his knowledge of Aristotle's ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;When we perceive an object by our senses, there is, first, some impression made by the object upon the organ of sense, either immediately, or by means of some medium. By this, an impression is made upon the brain, in consequence of which we feel some sensation. &quot; (Reid 1785)&lt;/font&gt;

He differs from Aristotle because he believes that the content of phenomenal consciousness is things in themselves, not signals derived from things in the brain.  However, he has no idea how such a phenomenon could occur:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;How a sensation should instantly make us conceive and believe the existence of an external thing altogether unlike it, I do not pretend to know; and when I say that the one suggests the other, I mean not to explain the manner of their connection, but to express a fact, which everyone may be conscious of namely, that, by a law of our nature, such a conception and belief constantly and immediately follow the sensation.&quot; (Reid 1764).&lt;/font&gt;

Reid's idea of mind is almost impossible to illustrate because it lacks sufficient physical definition.  It is like naive realism but without any communication by light between object and observer.  Reid was largely ignored until the rise of modern Direct Realism.

[[Image:Constudreid.png]]

Reading between the lines, it seems that Reid is voicing the ancient intuition that the observer and the content of an observation are directly connected in some way. As will be seen later, this intuition cannot distinguish between a direct connection with the world itself and a direct connection with signals from the world beyond the body that are formed into a virtual reality in the brain.

Watering chickens is not a hard thing to do.  It is said that 20 chickens drink about as much as a cow.    Since chickens are small creatures you don't need a lot of water to keep them going.  However, you do need to give them water several times a day when it is hot.  Since watering chicks is covered in the chicks section this section will cover adult chickens.

To hold the chickens water there are a variety of devices you can use.  Anything that can hold water will do.  Halves of tires, tip-over pails, tubs, etc.  A limiting factor is that it needs to be small enough for chickens to drink out of.  A tip-over pail is a small pail that you fill with water.  When you take it into your pen you tip it over and the chickens drink out of that.

For other devices all you have to do is fill them with water.  Every once in a while you should dump out the water (if it is dirty) and rinse and refill.  Chickens will often walk in their water and also kick stuff into it.  So to keep your chickens healthy it is a good idea to keep their water clean.

For a small collection of chickens, a dog bowl can work nicely — and it is easy to clean.  You can also buy electric dog bowls for the winter, which some of the contributers to this book have had a lot of success with.

== Basics of Caring for Baby Chickens ==

Hatcheries usually supply baby chickens in two varieties, the 'just
hatched' sort and the 'grown up' sort. 

== Just Hatched Chicks ==

They need:
# Warmth
# Drink
# Food
# Comfort



'''1.''' If they are cold, baby chickens might freeze to death. We don't want that, so we need to keep them warm. Start with 95 degrees in the first week, and then decrease the temperature by 5 degrees every week after until 6 weeks. A good way to provide said warmth is to buy a special 'Hen' lamp. It's a very big light bulb that produces much heat, as well as light. Make sure they don't have a cold floor where they will sleep. Some cardboard will do fine for insulation, but make sure the surface isn't slippery, if it should; it can lead to spraddled feet where the bones are bent to the side making the chick unable to walk.

'''2.''' It's pretty much obvious, but baby chickens need to drink. Under no circumstances give them un-boiled water. Their immune systems might not handle the germs just yet. Grain coffee (coffee made from oats or sum mat, as opposed to coffee made from coffee beans) is quite suitable for them. Make sure it's not hot. A good way to serve drink is to pour it into a jug, put a dish on top of the jug upside down, then flip the whole thing, so that the jug is upside down, standing on the dish. It should leak just enough coffee onto the dish so that the baby chickens can have a drink, and leak more when they have drunk some.

'''3.''' Baby chickens won't eat just any old thing. Milled oats are a good thing to feed them, at least initially. Hard boiled eggs (cut up into appropriate bite sized pieces, of course) go with the milled oats quite well. You may want to ask around in agriculture stores about special feed for baby chickens. They can eat some bread, but if they eat too much, it will kill them. It's good to add cut-up lettuce to the baby chickens' diet. If you're not squeamish, they love small, flightless invertebrates, and go crazy for worms.

'''4.''' Chickens are flock birds, sure, but even they don't like to be cramped. Cannibalism and trampling may ensue if they don't have enough space. Baby chickens grow quickly, so make sure you have room for them. Scatter some hay under the big light bulb so they have something to scratch in. Remember to replace the cardboard once it becomes saturated with poop, no one likes to sleep in feces.

== Grown But Still Baby Chicks ==

They're bigger and usually have feathers already.


They need:
# Drink
# Food
# Warmth
# Comfort


'''1.''' Now that they're grown up a bit, they can drink just about any water. But I'd recommend boiling it, nevertheless. Forget the trick with the jug, the chickens will tip them over frequently; use a pot or something of that kind. Also they can’t be covered up they will be scared. And when they cheap, they need company and calm them down.

'''2.''' Remember those special foods for baby chickens? It's a kind of meal, only with vitamins, minerals and what not. It's good for them. Mashed potatoes mixed with that meal, are better. And the chickens like it VERY much. Cut-up lettuce, cabbage, grass is fine at this point. Insects are always welcome and they can eat big bugs.

'''3.''' With feathers, warmth is less of a concern than before, but tries to keep the temperature steady at about 20 degrees Celsius.

'''4.''' Basically the same tips as before. Make sure they have room to romp, a place to sleep, and that they have a reasonably clean environment. Oh, and you need to provide them a sandbox of sorts in which they can dust bathe.

'''Io Facts''':
* Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System.
* Io is one of the few moons to have an atmosphere although it is very thin.
* At any given time, there are approximately 9 volcanoes erupting on Io.
* Io is so close to Jupiter that Jupiter causes &quot;tides&quot; in its surface. These &quot;tides&quot; are what makes it so volcanically active. 
* Io is one of only five of Jupiter's moons that can eclipse the Sun as seen from Jupiter.
* Io is the fourth-largest moon in the solar system.
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Image:Io_(Jupiter_moon)_PIA02308.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A picture of Io taken by Galileo space probe in 1999]]
Io is the innermost moon to Jupiter.  Be careful not to confuse Io the moon with 85 Io, an asteroid, or with I.O., an abbreviation that can stand for a number of different things.
== How big is Io? ==

Jupiter has 66 moons, but only four are large ones comparable to our Moon.  Io is one of these four, and the third largest. Io is 3642.6 km, or 0.28 Earths, wide. It only has a mass of about 1.4% of the mass of Earth. It is a similar size to our Moon (but a lot more exciting!).

== What is its surface like? ==

[[Image:Io_Earth_Moon_Comparison.png|right|thumb|200px|Io size compared to Earth and Earth's Moon]]

Unlike most moons, Io has a &quot;young&quot; surface. Because there is so much volcanic activity, the surface is almost free of craters. Also, its volcanoes are quite unusual. Because of the low gravity of Io and the explosiveness of the volcanoes, sometimes they eject material as far as 500 km above the ground. 500 km is more than the distance from ground level on Earth to the International Space Station. Sometimes the volcanoes erupt more calmly, more like geysers on Earth.  There are also ''shield volcanoes'' on Io, formed mostly from lava flows.

The temperature of Io varies wildly. At some spots, near volcanic eruptions, the temperature is very hot. But most of Io is very cold, as it is so far away from the sun. The average temperature of Io is -143°C. This is much colder than −90°C, the coldest it gets in Antarctica.

[[Image:Io_from_Galileo_and_Voyager_missions.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A map of Io surface]]

In addition to volcanoes, Io also has many mountains, lakes of molten sulfur, '''calderas''', and flows of molten sulfur or silicate hundreds of kilometers long. The colour of the surface is due to sulfur being at different temperatures. When sulfur warms up and cools down, it changes colour. This is why the surface of Io has so many colours. Some people think it looks like a pizza!

Io has 10 named regions (regions on the Earth would be the Middle East, the Far East, the West, etc) which all end in the word ''Regio'', which means in Latin ''Region''. All of the regions are named after ancient kingdoms and empires of Earth, similarly to how most planets and stars are named after gods and other characters from mythology. For example, the largest regio, ''Colchis Regio'' correlates to Colchis Kingdom in 550-164 BC. 

Io's volcanic features are all based on various beings in mythologies other than Greek mythology and Roman mythology. For example, Masubi is a volcano, but in Japanese mythology, he is the deity of fire who is said to have caused 8 volcanoes on earth. Another example would be another volcano named Ra. Ra in Egyptian mythology was the god of the sun. 

Io's mountains are a mix of many mythologies, in the aspects of their names. They all end in several Latin words vaguely meaning mountain. Danube Planum is based on the Danube river, which runs from southwest Germany to the Black Sea, while Egypt Mons is based on Egypt. On the other hand, there are mountains such as ''Epaphus Mensa'', named after Epaphus, son of Io and Zeus; and ''Ot Mons'' &amp;mdash; in Mongolian mythology, Ot Ene (the final &quot;e&quot; is pronounced) is the goddess of marriage, who was born at the beginning of the world, when the sky and the earth separated.

== How long is a day on Io? ==

[[Image:PIA02879 - A New Year for Jupiter and Io.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of Io taken by the Cassini space probe with Jupiter in the background]]

It takes 42 hours (1¾ Earth days) for Io to rotate on its axis. It also takes 42 hours for Io to complete one orbit around Jupiter. Since these numbers are the same, it means that the same side of Io always faces Jupiter. (Earth's moon is the same way, which is why you can always see the Man in the Moon.)

== Who is it named after? ==
Io (Ancient Greek ''Ἰώ'') &amp;mdash; pronounced ''eye''-oh &amp;mdash; is named after one of Zeus' (Jupiter's) 1000 lovers. She was a nymph. Nymphs are spirits of nature, associated with water, forests, and grottoes. According to the legend, Io was transformed into a cow by Zeus in order to hide her.

==How would Io's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth. A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.

== How was it discovered? ==
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|130x100px|framed|left|Galileo, the first discoverer of the Galilean moons in 1610.]]

Io was discovered by both Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei. Galileo discovered it on January 7, 1610, and Marius discovered it around the same time.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Ganymede Facts''':
* Ganymede is the only moon of Jupiter discovered by Galileo to be named after a male person.
* Ganymede, the Solar System's largest moon, is larger than either Mercury or Pluto.
* Ganymede is the only moon to have a '''magnetic field'''.
* Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.
&lt;/div&gt;

== How big is Ganymede? ==
Ganymede is 5262.4 km, or 0.413 Earths wide, making it a little larger than the Earth's moon. It is the largest of Jupiter's moons &amp;mdash; in fact it is the largest moon in the solar system.

[[File:Ganymed Earth Moon Comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison in size between Earth, the Moon and Ganymede]]

== What is its surface like? ==
The surface of Ganymede is divided into two regions: dark regions, and light regions. The dark regions are very old and highly cratered, while the light regions are younger (but still quite old), and marked by grooves and ridges. However, craters are found on both types of terrain, and are around 3 to 3&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; billion years old.  

Ganymede's crust is made of water ice. Like Earth's crust, it is broken up into plates, which can move. Along the fracture zones, mountain ranges have formed. Because the crust can flow, craters tend to be flat. Sometimes, old craters become '''palimpsests''' because of erosion casued by the crust.

Recently, the '''Hubble Space Telescope''' found evidence of an oxygen atmosphere on Ganymede. This does not mean that there is life on Ganymede; it is believed that the oxygen is produced when '''radiation''' splits the water ice (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is lost because it has a low '''mass''', while the oxygen forms the atmosphere.

== How long is a day on Ganymede? ==
One day on Ganymede is equal to about 7.15 days on Earth.

== How long is its orbit around Jupiter? ==
It takes Ganymede 7.15 days to orbit Jupiter. Ganymede orbits Jupiter at the same speed that it spins.

== Who is it named after? ==
Ganymede (Greek ''Γανυμήδης'') is named after a handsome Trojan boy who was made cupbearer to the gods by Jupiter (also known as Zeus).

== How was it discovered? ==
Ganymede was discovered by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius. Galileo found it on January 11, 1610, and Marius around the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Callisto.jpg|thumb|right|Callisto from the Galileo space craft]]
== How big is Callisto? ==
It is Jupiter's second largest moon, after [[../Ganymede|Ganymede]], and the third largest moon in the solar system.  It is a little more than one third the size of the earth. 

== What is its surface like? ==
The surface of Callisto is one of the most cratered in the Solar System. In fact, impact craters are the only features found on the surface. Because Callisto's surface is icy, large craters and mountains are slowly erased. Callisto's crust is about 4 billion years old, dating back to the formation of the Solar System.

The largest crater on the surface is Valhalla. It measures 3000 km across. The second largest crater, Asgard, measures 1600 km across. Gipul Catena, a series of craters in a straight line, was probably caused by an object that was tidally disrupted as it passed close to Jupiter.

There is no oxygen in the atmosphere. Under the rocky crust of the surface there is a salty underground sea.  

== How long is a day on Callisto? ==
One day on Callisto is equal to approximately 16.7 days on Earth.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Callisto Facts''':
* Callisto's crust dates back to the formation of the Solar System.
* A salty ocean may lay beneath the crust.
* It is the second largest of Jupiter's moons.
&lt;/div&gt;

== How long is its orbit around Jupiter? ==
One orbit around Jupiter is also equal to 16.7 days on Earth.

== Who is it named after? ==
Callisto (Greek ''Καλλιστώ'') is named after the Greek Mythological nymph named Kallisto, which meant &quot;most beautiful&quot; in Greek. Kallisto was one of Zeus' many lovers.

== How was it discovered? ==
Callisto was discovered by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius. Galileo discovered it on January 7, 1610, and Marius observed it around the same time.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Amalthea Facts''':
* Amalthea is the reddest object in the Solar System, even redder than Mars.
* Before 1975, Amalthea was not considered the official name (though it had extensive informal use) of the moon. Prior to the current name, it was called Jupiter V.
&lt;/div&gt;
[[File:Comparison of Amalthea to Io.jpg|300x300px|framed|right|A comparison between Io (Larger) and Amalthea (Smaller).]]
Amalthea is the third moon of Jupiter. Amalthea's oribt is very close to the Amalthea gossamer ring.

== How big is Amalthea? ==
Amalthea is not spherical like a ball, instead it looks like an asteroid. In fact, there is an asteroid in the asteroid belt named ''113 Amalthea''. However, the asteroid is completely unrelated to the moon. This moon of Jupiter has an average diameter of 172 km. The entire moon is actually a bit smaller than Ireland.

== What is its surface like? ==
The surface of Amalthea is bright crimson. The reddish colour may be from sulfur or some other non-ice material. Amalthea has multiple craters, but only two are named: Pan, named after the Greek god of the wild; and Gaia, goddess of the Earth. Amalthea also has two named mountains, both named after places in Crete, the largest island of Greece:  Lyctos Facula, named after Lyctos; and Ida Facula, named after Mount Ida. ''Facula'', in Latin, means a small torch.

== How long is a day on Amalthea? ==
One day on Amalthea is equal to about half of an Earth day. One day is 11 hours, 57 minutes, and 23 seconds, barely more time than Jupiter takes to rotate.

== How long is its orbit around Jupiter? ==

One orbit around Jupiter also takes the same time as a day on Amalthea &amp;mdash; about half of an Earth day.  Since these two times are the same, the same side of Amalthea always faces Jupiter. Earth's moon is the same way, which is why you can always see the Man in the Moon.

==How would Amalthea's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on the surface of Amalthea, you would weigh only 1/555 of what you do on Earth. A one hundred pound person would weigh only 0.18 pounds on Amalthea, which is a little more than ten 50p, or 14 quarters!  
This means that if you could lift ten kilograms on earth, you could hold three cars on Amalthea. The strongest weightlifter would be able to lift a blue whale, the heaviest animal on Earth.

== Who is it named after? ==
Amalthea (Greek ''Ἀμάλθεια'') is named after a nymph in Greek myths who nursed Zeus, which is the Greek counterpart of the god Jupiter, with goat's milk.

== How was it discovered? ==
[[File:EdwardEmersonBarnard.jpg|100x140px|framed|left|Edward Emerson Barnard, the discoverer of Amalthea.]]
Amalthea was discovered on September 22, 1892 by Edward Emerson Barnard, using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope at Lick Observatory, in California. He was the first to discover a new moon of Jupiter since Galileo discovered Io and Europa in 1610.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Raising Chickens}}

Feeding chickens is almost as easy as watering them.  In nature chickens are the garbage cleaners of the south east Asian jungle.  For everyday food you can feed your chickens either chicken food (found at feed stores) or pig food.  In Alberta the UFA Hog Grower is the same as the chick starter except the pellets are bigger, and the hog grower contains less antibiotics.  If you have access to grain then you can feed that to them.  Whenever you make food with lots of scraps (peelings and bits of vegetables that humans shouldn't eat) then feed those to them.  Chickens can be trained so well if they see a small bucket (for carrying chicken scraps) they get excited because a treat is coming.  You can feed your chickens in a trough, appropriate sized container, or by scattering the food on the ground.  You can even give your chickens bones with scraps of meat on them.  There is very little that they won't eat.  

== Information Specific to Laying Hens ==
Laying hens require calcium for egg shells. During the laying season, put a pile or box of crushed clam shells in their pen. Crushed clam shells are available at most local feed/farm stores. If you scatter the clam shells too much, you won't know when the hens need more until you see paper-thin shells. Egg shells also work for the calcium, but you run the risk of the birds learning to eat their own eggs.  To avoid this you should crush the shells so that they don't look like eggs.

|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Common food that chickens shouldn't/won't eat
|-
|'''Food'''
|'''Reason'''
|-
|Orange peels
|Too tough for chickens to chew on.  Chickens will play with them if they are bored, though. The orange itself chickens will eat.
|-
|Watermelon rinds
|Too thick/tough for chickens to chew on but they do love the actual fruit part.
|-I've seen chickens eat watermelon rind right down to the green part. They love it. Besides chickens don't chew. They swallow whole. That's the reason for the craw and gizzard. Watermelon hold a lot of water that chickens don't want too much of.
|-
|Rye kernels
|Chickens don't like them.  Some chickens do enjoy Rye, just a little.
|-
|Chicken
|Because they ''are'' chickens.  Although chickens will happily eat chicken and other meat products.  After [[Raising_Chickens/Death/Butchering|butchering]] a chicken you can leave the skeleton in the pen and they will pick the bones clean.  If done on a large scale, making chicken feed from chickens (especially the brain and spinal cord) can lead to an outbreak of [[w:Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|encephalopathy]], similar to mad cow disease.
|-
|Carrots
|Chickens can't eat large hard chunks but they will eat carrot peels.
|-
|Curry
|They like it, but it has bad effects on their droppings.
|-
|Banana
|Some chickens like bananas while other do not. It really depends on the breed. &lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Raising Chickens/Feeding#Bananas|Disputed]]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Potato Peel
|Chickens normally don't like very many root plants, so they will not usually eat potato peels but they do like leftover mashed potato.
|-
|Tomato
|Not a problem in small quantities. In excess reduces the droppings.
|-
|Apple  
|It is fine to give one apple to four birds once every two weeks if given too regular it may give them a stomach upset.  They absolutely love the peel too. 
|-
|Baked beans
|They just don't like them- also disputed
|-
|Grapes
|Chickens really seem to love grapes - not mine! They didn´t notice nice white organic grapes for 2 days
|-
|Gooseberries
|A similar reaction to that of grapes.
|-
|Rice
|Chickens love rice
|-
|Pasta
|Same with rice, they especially love spaghetti (reminds them of worms).  Cut it down in size though.
|-
|Fish skin
|They love fish and skin, has a lot of calcium for layers.
|-
|Mice
|Dead or alive they will fight over them and chase them.
|-
|Ham
|Chickens love ham
|}
Lettuce, cauliflower and cabbage leaves
Feel free to add items that you have found chickens shouldn't or won't eat though just like people they are individuals and all have their own likes and dislikes so it cannot be justly said that they WILL or WILL NOT eat a certain food. 

Cheese: 
My chickens go mad for cheese. It is very fatty however and should not be given in abundance. 

And finally, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER feed chickens (or any other bird) avocado. 
Avocados (their peelings, the fruit itself, and the seeds) are POISONOUS TO BIRDS.</text>

Laying hens require calcium for egg shells.  During the laying season, put a pile or box of crushed clam shells in their pen.  Crushed clam shells are available at most local feed/farm stores.  If you scatter the clam shells too much, you won't know when the hens need more until you see paper-thin shells.  Egg shells also work for the calcium, but you run the risk of the birds learning to eat their own eggs.

The only time I pen/cage my birds is when they hatch a clutch of chicks.  (Normally, they and all the other critters on the farm run around together.)  When they're penned or caged the thing they love most is greens.  I usually throw in bunches of grasses and garden weeds.  You might be able to get someone that doesn't spray their lawn to let you rake their clippings for your birds.

I am new to chicken raising - having inherited 6 chickens from the previous owner of the house. At present i am only giving them 'Crumble' and fresh water, but from reading here it sounds like they need more! if I give them 'greens' do i need to chop them up i.e. cabbage, green beans etc? Wha about califlower stalks? Potatoe skins?
Any advice would be appreciated! 
(lfnolan@attglobal.net)

We pull up full cabbage from the neighbouring fields and give them to our chickens and they love them. They will peck at and tear off chunks of leaf and peck at the roots and soil on the roots. They struggle with the solid heart and the stalk though. They will eat cabbage and greens cooked as well. As a general rule of thumb, if its hard and solid they can't cope with it very well, try cooking it and mashing or chopping it. If its reasonably soft or leafy they will shred it themselves. They are not stupid and they know what they like. If they don't eat what you give them stop giving them it. If something makes them feel ill they quickly learn to stop eating it. (so long as it isn't so poisonous it kills them outright, but I've not come across anything like that yet.)We even have laburnum trees and the seeds go everywhere and are poisonous, they just know not to eat them. So don't worry too much about what you are giving them, they'll let you know if they don't like it.

Oatmeal, dry or prepared. Corn. Sunflower seeds (cracked open). Old Cereal. Bread. Grapes (pinch in half or they cant get a grip to peck on) Watermelon rinds.

Our chickens love baked beans, but won't eat carrots or sweet potato, so we think they possibly don't usually like orange things, as they won't eat orange peel either. They also eat leftover toast, but it helps if you soak it first, otherwise they tend to leave little bits and then you can end up getting rats. They will eat pretty much anything, but we gave them curried lentils the other day, and it made their eggs taste of curry, so we won't be doing that again!

Our chicken love cooked oatmeal. Warm too.

&quot;''Because they are chickens. Although chickens will happily eat chicken and other meat products.

This does bring up an interesting point.  Chickens being scavangers will eat meat.  Is it safe for chickens to eat a diet a meat products including but not limited to poultry?  I havn't given my chickens much meat products other than what is in UFA Hog Growers.  My dogs end up with most of the meat producsts that people don't eat.  I have even started giving moldy buns to my dogs instead of chickens.  The chickens don't seem to care too much about the buns anymore.  My dogs love them, they are almost like Dog candy.  BTW if you are intersted in Buns for Dogs what I ended up doing was given them some old Costco buns that had gone moldy. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 21:36, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

Chickens naturally eat meat. They love nothing more than a good juicy worm, in fact I virtually get mugged now when I get the spade out of the shed as they know it means digging and worms. So I don't think meat in their diet is a problem. Our chickens get left overs from all our family and neighbours and they are pretty happy and healthy on it.
 
Do snails count as meat? Because they love them and the shell would probably supply calcium.

Chocolate can be fatal for birds.

[[User:Hajhouse]] adds:

* My chickens don't like rye kernels
* Aledgedly chickens can't digest raw potatoes

They seem to love potatoes! Prefer cooked to raw, as well as prefering them mashed to whole; easier for them to eat.[[User:82.38.78.129|82.38.78.129]] 13:55, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

DO NOT feed chickens or people GREEN potato peels!!!   Since potatoes are part of the nightshade family (like tomatoes, eggplant and deadly nightshade) if the peels get green from exposure to the sun they develop vastly increased levels of solanine which is toxic in very small quantities.  Solanin is the same poison that is concentrated in deadly nightshade &amp;  tomato leaves.  That's why you peel off the skin from greened potatoes, and it's better not to eat them at all!

The presentation of this information seems very muddled up, it starts up saying that Chickens shouldnt or cant eat something and gives a reason for it and yet in the same table shows things that they love to eat. This really needs ot be broken down into two separate tables with one only showing stuff they shouldnt eat with a justification against each item and the other showing stuff they do like to eat rather than including both in one table entitled stuff that shouldnt eat.




Gave them bananas and they didn't seem to care for them. I guess it was too mushy for them??

A lot of leafy greens like bok choi and lettuce they seem to ignore. Nothing the least bit spicy, salty or peppered. 
Tried giving them pill bugs as 'meat' along with snails. They rolled the pill bugs around and gave me the look. ''You want me to eat '''WHAT?'''''

==Disputes==
===Bananas===
According to the chart chickens don't like Bananas however, I have received a message saying
 I feed my baby chicks a ripe banana as a treat, and they love it! I have 18 chicks, and I give them one banana every day, 
 by hand. You can use this or not........The adults like it, too.
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:48, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

I will second this, my chickens actually fight over banana's and will eat skin and all.
My chickens enjoyed a ripe banana today, peel and all.


I will also second this, (or third it), my chickens love bananas. A tasty treat for them.

Cautionary Note: Aren't banana skins loaded with pesticide (except organic, one assumes)?

Our chickens go crazy for bananas.

I grind up corn stalks and sun flower plants they love it.
I read somewher to give them fish raw or cooked?

my chickens won't touch any citrus fruits, love cabbage raw and bacon rinds... they love meat but i refuse to give them any poultry products. i don't think it's healthy.

My chickens love watermelon! They eat everything but the outside skin, even the green part that we don't eat. They also love tomatoes.

We nursed a very sick chook back to health, one of the things she really enjoyed was mashed banana.



MY CHICKENS DO NOT EAT CELERY OR BROCCOLI

I also feed my chickens banana, they all love them!!!

While I didn't attempt the peel, mine go nutso over really ripe bananas.

My chickens love the vegetable mash mix i make for them, I juice fruits and vegtables for myself and the pieces that are on the ends like celery, spinish stems, parsley stems, very ripe banana, grapes that on a little too soft for me to want, they all go into the blender with some juice and then i add mash to this juice mixture to make it the consitency of crumble.  I use up scraps that are very healthy for them and they love the mix.[[User:Icre8arch|Icre8arch]] ([[User talk:Icre8arch|talk]]) 23:07, 20 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Planets2013.jpg|180x200px|framed|left|The eight planets of the Solar System, and the sun. Sizes are to scale, but distances are not.]]
Do you ever wonder about the things in the sky&amp;mdash;the Sun, the Moon, the stars? People have been watching the sky for a long time, trying to figure out what is out there. We keep coming up with new ways to learn more about outer space.

&lt;!-- 1 What is the Solar System? --&gt;

''Planets'' are big balls of rock or gas that move around stars. We live on one we call the Earth, which moves around a star we call the Sun. There are at least seven other planets moving around the Sun and a lot of other smaller things as well. All these things together are called a ''system''. The Latin word for the Sun is ''Sol'', so we call this system the ''Solar System''. Far beyond our own Solar System are stars, bodies like the Sun but in some cases much bigger.


&lt;!-- 2 Who discovered the solar system? --&gt;
&lt;!-- 3 How have we explored the solar system? --&gt;
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun. Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars). This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?

About 500 years ago another man named Copernicus said the same thing as Aristarchus; that all the planets moved around the Sun and the stars were fixed in space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#q21&lt;/ref&gt; This time more people agreed but there were still people who thought the opposite. Then, about 100 years later, a man called Galileo began looking at the sky with a new invention: the telescope. He showed that it was very likely that all the planets moved around the Sun. This time even more people thought Galileo may be right and that the Earth really did move around the Sun. Soon, more and more people started using telescopes to study the sky. However there were still some people who thought Galileo was wrong and he was even arrested and taken to court for lying. All the people who believed him began to learn how the planets and the other things in the Solar System moved so they could prove that he was not lying. Thousands of years after Aristarchus, people finally said &quot;Okay, the Earth does move around the Sun&quot;. Galileo couldn't be called a liar anymore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#galileo&lt;br&gt;See also {{cite book|last=Drake|first=Stillman (translator)|date=1957|publisher=Anchor, NY|title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo (1610 Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina)|isbn=0385092393}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 4 How was it formed? --&gt;
&lt;!-- 5 What will happen to the solar system? --&gt;
We can use very large telescopes to see what has happened to other stars. We can compare pictures of distant stars with pictures of our own star, the Sun. We live in exciting times because for the first time we have sent people into space and we also have telescopes in space. These telescopes in space take thousands of pictures of the planets, our sun and the distant stars. On Earth people use the photos to learn about all the different things in the Solar System and they try to explain how the Solar System began. We even have a robot on the red planet Mars that moves around and people on Earth tell it where to go and what to photograph. We also want to know what will happen to the Earth and the Solar System in the future. 

== What is in the Solar System? == 
[[Image:Solar sys.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Solar System, showing the Sun, inner planets, asteroid belt, outer planets, an outer dwarf planet, and a comet. (Not to scale!)]]
At the center of the Solar System is the Sun. It is a star, like the billions of other stars in the sky. The other stars are very, very far away, so they look tiny.  The Sun is important to us because it gives us heat and energy that allows life. None of the life on Earth could exist without the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/sun.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the things in the Solar System ''orbit'' (travel around) the Sun. The planets are the largest of these. Each planet is a little like the Earth. But the planets are also very different from each other.

Many of the planets have ''moons''. A moon orbits a planet. Mercury has no moons&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury&amp;Display=Moons&lt;/ref&gt; and nor does Venus. Earth has one. Jupiter has 63!&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter&amp;Display=Moons&lt;/ref&gt;

The planets closest to the Sun are called the ''inner planets''. These are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Then comes a big ring of ''asteroids'', chunks of rock much smaller than planets. This ring is called the ''asteroid belt''. Within the asteroid belt, there is a dwarf planet (smaller than a normal planet) named Ceres. Then come the ''outer planets'': Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Farther out there are two dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris. 

The planets have the names of Roman gods that were worshipped by people thousands of years ago though no one believes in them now. Did you know that some days of the week are also the names of ancient gods? Saturday means &quot;Saturn Day&quot;. Thursday means &quot;Thor Day&quot;. Thor was a Viking god, the son of Odin. Monday and Sunday simply mean &quot;Moon Day&quot; and &quot;Sun Day&quot;. Some of the months are also named after Roman gods. The month of &quot;March&quot; is named after the Roman god &quot;Mars&quot; - he was the god of War!

Beyond the orbit of Neptune is another big ring of things like the asteroids, called the ''Kuiper belt''. Kuiper (said &quot;KYE-per&quot;) was the last name of the person who first wrote about it. Most of the things in the Kuiper belt are hard to see through telescopes.

After the Kuiper belt comes the ''Oort cloud''. Scientists think this is where ''comets'' come from.  It is very far away, many times farther away than Pluto is from the Sun (over a thousand times). It is near the edge of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; (Yes, &quot;Oort&quot; was the last name of the person who first wrote about it.)

&lt;!--Copyedited to here, 6 December 2005--&gt;
[[File:Zodiacal Light Seen from Paranal.jpg|200x200px|framed|left|Zodiacal light.]]
In between all the other things is dust. The pieces of dust are very far apart, but they shine in the light of the Sun. Before dawn, in September or October, they glow in the East. We call this the ''zodiacal glow'', or ''zodiacal light''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2001/20020301.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When pieces of space dust hit the Earth's atmosphere, they burn brightly. We call them shooting stars or meteors.

The Sun creates ''solar wind''&amp;mdash;a kind of gas that blows away from the Sun into space. This gas travels out past the planets into outer space. The edge, where the solar wind meets the wind from other stars, is called the ''heliopause''.  That is about 100 times as far from us as the Earth is from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020624.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that is a lot of empty space. The nearest star to our Sun is thousands of times farther away than the size of the entire solar system. The Universe is a really huge and empty place!&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Outside Our Solar System&quot; in http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/space/spacover.html&lt;/ref&gt;

 

===What holds it together?===
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|200x220px|framed|left|Sir Isaac Newton, the discoverer of gravity. It is said that he came up with the concept of gravity when an apple fell on his head.]]
Why do all of the planets orbit the Sun? Why do moons orbit planets? Why doesn't the Sun move off and leave the planets behind? The answer to all of these questions has to do with ''gravity''. Gravity is a force that is a property of ''mass''. It pulls things together.  

We don't notice the pull from the Sun because it also pulls on the Earth by the same amount. But the Sun's gravity is strong enough to keep the Earth from shooting away. Even though the Earth is going fast, it keeps turning to go around the Sun. It is like they were tied together with an invisible string. In the same way, moons orbit many of the planets. They are kept there by gravity. The Sun itself does not sit still in space. The entire Solar System is orbiting the center of our galaxy. The whole thing stays together because of the force of gravity&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gravity is the force responsible for keeping the Earth and other planets in our solar system in orbit around the Sun.&quot; from Cosmic Glue, http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970108b.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;!-- This is too advanced! -- Each of the planets' gravity pulls not only on the Sun, but also on the other planets and moons. (and everything else too!)  This makes the shape of the orbits of all the planets and moons change a little bit. As the planets and moons keep moving, the amount the orbits change, and what way they change, also keeps changing.  These changes are called ''orbital perturbations'' by scientists. Its a lot of change to figure out, but astronomers can do a very good job of predicting where a planet will be at any time. Astronomers use careful measurements and mathematics to predict orbits.--&gt;

====About mass====
Everything is made out of matter. The amount of matter is called mass. Two apples have twice the mass of one apple. The more mass a thing has, the more gravity pulls it and the more its gravity pulls other objects. We don't notice the pull from an apple because it is so much less than the pull from the Earth. If you stand on the ground and let go of an apple, gravity will pull it down towards the center of the Earth. It will hit the ground. If you could throw the apple hard enough at the right angle, it would go into orbit around the Earth. That is how rockets put astronauts into orbit. If you threw the apple really, REALLY hard in the right direction, it would fly away from Earth and never come back; but our arms are not that strong.

The force of gravity from anything is strongest when very close to that thing, and weaker when further from it.  Scientists use ''weight'' to mean how hard gravity pulls us. Astronauts weigh less on the moon because it has less mass. It does not pull as hard. We actually weigh a tiny bit less on top of a tall mountain than we do in a lower place. This is because we are farther from most of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions of Mass, Gravity, and Weight from http://ksnn.larc.nasa.gov/webtext.cfm?unit=float&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who discovered the Solar System?==
Anyone who looks up at the sky enough can see seven bright objects. These are the Sun, our Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. People have known about them for a very long time. Ancient people thought they were related to gods. In Babylon, they named the days of the week after them. Almost everyone was sure that all these things were orbiting the Earth. They did not know we lived in a '''Solar''' System. 

In about 1500, Nicholaus Copernicus figured out that the planets orbit the Sun. Only the Moon orbits the Earth. But he was afraid to say so for most of his life and only published a full account of his ideas in 1543, the year of his death&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#q21&lt;/ref&gt;. Then Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope at the sky. He found moons orbiting Jupiter. He was certain Copernicus was right, and he got in trouble for saying so. It took seventy years to convince scientists that the planets orbit the Sun&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#galileo&lt;/ref&gt;.  Now, almost everyone on Earth understands that we live in a Solar System. &lt;!-- cut down word count &quot;found moons orbiting Jupiter&quot; instead of &quot;saw moons orbiting Jupiter for the first time--&gt;

==How have we explored the Solar System?==
&lt;!-- This section is more or less chronological --&gt;
[[Image:Voyager spacecraft.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Voyager 2 space craft.]]
[[Image:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An artist's impressions of Spirit.]]
&lt;!-- exploring with our eyes and with ancient celestial observatories --&gt;
&lt;!-- time of year is solar/stellar --&gt;
Before the telescope&lt;!--was invented (is a 3-syllable word)--&gt;, people explored the sky with their eyes.  They saw how the planets seemed to &quot;wander&quot; through the sky. They learned to predict where the Sun, the moon, and planets would be in the sky. They built some ''observatories'' -- places for watching the sky. ''Observe'' is a more scientific word for ''watch''. They observed the Sun and stars to tell the time of year. In China, they even knew when the moon would block the Sun&lt;ref&gt;Eclipse2001 museum http://museumeclipse.org/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Most people thought that ''celestial bodies'' could cause war or peace on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raman|first=Varadaraja V.|title=Glimpses of Ancient Science and Scientists|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=073881363X|date=2000}}&lt;br /&gt;page 339 &quot;The Chaldeans ... were also the first to suspect... that the Sun, the moon, the planets and the constellation of stars, all affect human life and destiny.... These beliefs gradually spread .. to Egypt, China, Greece, India, and Rome, for example ... astrology is still very popular.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- exploration via telescope--&gt;
After telescopes were first made, in the early 17th century, people kept making them better. Astronomers saw that planets are not like stars.  They are worlds, like the Earth. They could see that some planets have moons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#galileo&lt;/ref&gt; They began to think about what these worlds were like. At first, some thought that the other planets and moons had people or animals living on them. They thought about how it would be to live on these other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://vesuvius.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/mars.html;&lt;br /&gt; {{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|title=Mars and the Mind of Man|publisher=Harper and Row|date=1973|isbn=0060104430}};&lt;br /&gt; {{cite book|last=Verne|first=Jules|title=From the Earth to the Moon|isbn=1582871035|publisher=North Books|date=1995}};&lt;br /&gt; From the Earth to the Moon on Project Gutenberg -- http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/83;&lt;/ref&gt; Then they made telescopes better, and sent spacecraft into space, and found that there were no plants or animals on the Moon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/reference/mars/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; or on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-15-4.html (bottom of page)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- manned and unmanned spacecraft send back pictures, samples, and data --&gt;
&lt;!-- Getting more detailed as we approach the present --&gt; 
Now, we can explore by going to some of the other worlds.  Twelve Astronauts walked on the Moon about 35 years ago. They brought rocks and dirt back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/apollo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Spacecraft flew by Venus, Mars, and the outer planets.  The pictures they took showed us a lot of what we know about these worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solarviews.com/eng/sc_hist.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Robots landed on Mars in 1971, 1976, and 1997.  They took thousands of pictures of the planets.  Two robots, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, are working on Mars right now.  They send photos and movies back to Earth. They also check rocks to find out what the rocks are made of.&lt;ref&gt;http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, we have not found any life except on Earth.  Maybe tiny one-celled life once lived on Mars.  Maybe there is life under the ice on Jupiter's moon Europa.  New spacecraft are being planned to look for life on these worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/Why_We_12.html; http://www.infoplease.com/spot/astronomy1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==How was our Solar System formed?==
Our Solar System is part of the Milky Way ''galaxy''.  Galaxies are big mixes of dust, gas, stars, and other things.  Inside our Milky Way galaxy are clouds of dust and gas where stars are born. Our Solar System was created in this kind of cloud. A part of the cloud began to get smaller and less spread out.  It formed a big, spinning disk of gas and tiny pieces of dust. This disk was thickest at the middle.  The middle slowly collapsed until it became the Sun. We are still trying to learn how the planets were formed.  Most scientists think that they were formed from the left over gas and dust.

[[File:Protoplanetary disk.jpg|200x200px|framed|left|An artist's illlustration of how the Solar System began.]]
This is how it could have happened.  The rest of the disk continued to spin around the Sun. The tiny pieces of dust hit each other and some of them stuck together, next the bits of dust slowly collected to form grains, these in turn joined to form lumps the size of gravel, then pebbles, and then rocks.  The rocks crashed together into mountains.  The mountains crashed together to make bigger things.  These big things swept up most of the rest of the disk to form the planets, moons, and asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/science/origins.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun got hotter as it collapsed.  It began to glow.  The temperature at the center reached a million degrees.  The Sun started to make a lot of light and heat. This light and heat swept away most of the leftover dust and gas between the inner planets.  This light and heat are the sunlight we see and feel every day on Earth.  &lt;ref&gt;http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_2a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==What will happen to the Solar System?==
&lt;!-- There is some dispute about whether the Sun is big enough to form a planetary nebula  See http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html for discussion and refs --&gt;
&lt;!-- Planetary nebulae are not always spherical.  See http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1997/38/ 
As well as the photo in this section --&gt;

In another five billion years, the Sun will use up most of its hydrogen fuel. It will enter the final stages of its life. The middle of the Sun will shrink down and become even hotter. The outer layer of the Sun will grow much bigger than it is now. It will form a ''red giant''.

It will be so big that Mercury and Venus, probably Earth and maybe even Mars will be inside it. These planets will burn away. Which planets get destroyed will depend on how much mass the Sun has left.&lt;ref&gt;Which planets may get destroyed http://www.public.iastate.edu/~lwillson/FuturSun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A strong solar wind will blow some of the outer layers of gas away from the Sun. The Sun will have less mass. The Sun’s gravity will be less. All of the planets will move further away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Outline of Sun's death http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Lectures/vistas97.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EtaCarinae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The massive, rapidly-aging star ''Eta Carinae'' throws off a giant cloud of gas, forming a ''planetary nebula''.]]

After it has been a red giant for a while, the Sun will start to burn ''helium''. It will shrink down and will not be a red giant any more. It will use the helium up in about a billion years. Then it will become a red giant once again. More gas will blow away for a few hundred thousand years.

A ''planetary nebula''&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;A ''planetary'' nebula was named this because through the earliest telescopes, astronomers thought that they looked like planets.  The name stuck &amp;mdash; but they really have nothing to do with planets.&lt;/ref&gt; will form.  The nebula could last for a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years.  It will glow in the light of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Planetary nebulae http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the center, the Sun might shrink into a tiny star called a '''white dwarf'''. That kind of star is about the size of Earth. It would take about 100 of these white dwarfs, stacked end to end, to be as wide as the Sun is today. The Sun will not have any more fuel to burn. It will have lots of heat left over and will keep getting cooler and dimmer. Then its light will go out in a hundred billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;Has information on white dwarf stars http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RelWWW/tests.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping your chickens happy is very easy to do.  If you have a big enough pen then you will already have very happy chickens.  There are also many things to can do to keep them even happier.


== Build Roosts ==
[[Image:hen_roost.jpg|left|A photo of a hen sitting on a roost]]

WARNING: Roosts should only be built in [[Raising_Chickens/shelter|shelters]] that are large enough for you to stand in comfortably.

Building roosts is easy to do. All you need are some thin poles and wire. Wooden poles work best as they are most like what a chicken would find naturally. One method that works is the use of poplar trees as poles. If you are using poplar (or similar tree) then use young saplings. Trees that are around 5 years old are best.  When selection used trees that are about the thickness of a broom handle.  In the case of poplar don't worry if you are killing the tree.  Poplar Trees reproduce by sending up shoots from their roots as well as seed.  Even if you do end up killing a poplar tree in a couple of years more will grow to replace it.  When you have your poles, make sure that they are the right size to fit in your shelter. Adjust size as needed then use your wire to tie that together so that they form a ladder that covers the width of the shelter. Your roosts should be fairly tall and strong. From experience, some of our contributors have found that chickens prefer to sleep in their roosts

== Scatter food (for them to find) ==

To do this all you have to do is scatter your chickens' food around and let them follow their natural instincts.  In the jungle, where chickens originally came from, wild chickens spent their day looking around for things to eat. Scattering their food around their pen allows them to do this in a safe (no predators and guaranteed food) setting.

If you have hay down to keep the mud away try scattering some corn in the hay. This results in the chickens spreading the hay around while being entertained (IF you do not let them out).

== Give them scraps you normally wouldn't ==

This method requires that you give your chickens scraps that aren’t unhealthy for your chickens but they still won't eat. These are scraps that, for whatever reason, your chickens would rather (or can only) play with instead of eat. A good example is Orange peels. Chickens find it difficult to eat these because they are too tough. However, if your chickens are bored then giving these to them will give them something to play with. Orange peels won't cause harm to your chickens and as such are safe. For a complete list of foods that Chickens normally don't eat see [[Raising_Chickens/Feeding|Feeding]]. 

Also, if your chickens don't have the ability to free range for their nutritional needs, you must provide them with grit (ground stone) to aid them with digestion.  Birds lack the ability to chew their food so must crush it in the gizzard, a strong muscle that uses grit to break apart the grain they consume.

== Other methods ==
For a list of methods that have worked for other people (or to post your own) go to the [[Talk:Raising_Chickens/Keeping_your_chickens_happy|discussion page]] for this chapter.
Keep a small pail under your kitchen sink and add tasty bits to feed later to your chickens.  You can save carrots, bits of celery and lettuce, etc.  If you just throw them on the ground inside their pen, they will rush over to investigate and enjoy a treat that is more interesting than their regular chicken food, but make sure the food isn't rotten or spoiled.

Depending on the kinds of chickens you have, you may be able to get them to come near you and you can hold them and pet them as well. Some of them just run away from you when you try to get closer to them. I missed the kind that I had when I was in Luang-Prabang, Laos. Some of them are very sportive and you can let them fight a little for exercises. Please let them fight for fun only and make sure that it's not for gambling or for serious killing of one another !


Mine seem to like me cracking sunflower seeds and chucking them in the pineneedles to find.

== Hand raising chicks ==

Handling chicks is the best way have tame friendly adult chickens. Friendly chickens are much easier to  handle and care for than shy or unfriendly chickens, however if you are raising your chickens for meat (and not as pets or for egg production) having an up-close and personal relationship with your poultry may not be a good idea. Friendly chickens don't just run up to you when you have food; they will perch on your lap or shoulder and coo sweetly to you,because their always up for a snuggle ;D.

Take into account that breeds such as Rhode Island Reds seem to be the most playful, however they are high strung, sometimes aggressive and are never as friendly and cuddly as Buff Orpingtons or Wyandottes. Roosters and cockerels are naturally more aggressive than pullets and hens.

When they are very small you can scoop the chicks up and hold them in the palm of your hand, be sure to keep them warm and always be very gentle with chicks before their feathers grow in. Do not squeeze chicks. It's best to sit on the floor and hold the chick low so that if it walks off of your hand it will land softly.

As the chicks grow larger you can play with them much more, be gentle and patient. Chicks are capable of running very fast and can cram themselves into very small spaces; be sure to play with them where they cannot run under (or into) furniture or small openings or where other animals might trap them (even the friendliest house cat can be a serious threat to a small chick.) 

In general most chickens like exercise and stimulation so you can be creative, use a bell caged in a plastic ball or dangle parakeet toys for chicks and larger cockatoo and cat toys for fully grown chickens. One fun way to give treats to your chicks is to drill small holes in a plastic ball or egg (like the kind used for Easter candy) and put a little chick starter inside, as they grow older you can put corn, carrot peelings, clean crushed shell, or left overs from your meals inside just to keep things interesting. Some chickens get quite possessive of their favorite toys so if you have more than one chicken be sure to have plenty toys to go around.

If you have too many chicks to hold then usually a handwarmer under some small towels will provide enough warmth for the rest.

== Any coop needs roosts. ==

This silly page says the following
&quot;WARNING: Roosts should only be built in for shelters that are large enough for you to stand in comfortably.&quot;

That has to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Chickens instinctively want/need to roost. The height of the coop is irrelevant to that need.

== Your Hatchery ==
Add your hatchery here
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 06:08, 3 Jul 2005 (UTC)

=== Alturnative ===
An alternative to finding a hatchery is to find already grown hens/roosters.  Many small growers are ready to give them away (free/barter/cheap) at the end of the laying season.  Obviously your selection is limited to what's available, but this method saves the expense and trouble of dealing with chicks.  Keep an eye on the local paper or bargain sheet.  You can also ask anyone with a flock if they'd be willing to part with a few birds.  Depending on the purpose of your flock, someone else's culls might be just the right birds for you.  Be careful that you pick up healthy birds.  

When you introduce new birds to your established flock, it won't take long for new and old birds to integrate and establish their &quot;pecking order.&quot;  Not to worry, it looks nasty at first but they quickly work it out.  If two of them insist on constantly fighting, they'll be so busy with each other that you can easily pick up and move one of the birds to another part of the pen.  If you're adding a grown rooster to a flock that already has one, I recommend avoiding a new one that's been the only or head honcho at his old place.  Pick the second or third in the pecking order if you have a choice so your current head rooster can get along with him.</text>

==Introduction==
Finding the area between two curves, usually given by two explicit functions, is often useful in calculus.

In general the rule for finding the area between two curves is

&lt;math&gt; A = A_{top} - A_{bottom} \ &lt;/math&gt; or

If f(x) is the upper function and g(x) is the lower function

&lt;math&gt; A = \int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

This is true whether the functions are in the first quadrant or not.

== Area between two curves ==
Suppose we are given two functions ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=f(x)'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=g(x)'' and we want to find the area between them on the interval ''[a,b]''. Also assume that ''f(x)&amp;ge; g(x)'' for all ''x'' on the interval ''[a,b]''. Begin by partitioning the interval ''[a,b]'' into ''n'' equal subintervals each having a length of ''&amp;Delta;x=(b-a)/n''. Next choose any point in each subinterval, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*''. Now we can 'create' rectangles on each interval. At the point ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*'', the height of each rectangle is ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)-g(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)'' and the width is ''&amp;Delta;x''. Thus the area of each rectangle is ''[f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)-g(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)]&amp;Delta;x''. An ''approximation'' of the area, ''A'', between the two curves is 
:&lt;math&gt; A := \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(x_{i}^{*})-g(x_{i}^{*})]\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now we take the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity and get
:&lt;math&gt;A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(x_{i}^{*})-g(x_{i}^{*})]\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; 
which gives the exact area. Recalling the definition of the definite integral we notice that 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]\,dx&lt;/math&gt;. 
This formula of finding the area between two curves is sometimes known as applying integration with respect to the ''x''-axis since the rectangles used to approximate the area have their bases lying parallel to the ''x''-axis. It will be most useful when the two functions are of the form ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=f(x)'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=g(x)''. Sometimes however, one may find it simpler to integrate with respect to the ''y''-axis. This occurs when integrating with respect to the ''x''-axis would result in more than one integral to be evaluated. These functions take the form ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=f(y)'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=g(y)'' on the interval ''[c,d]''. Note that ''[c,d]'' are values of ''y''. The derivation of this case is completely identical. Similar to before, we will assume that ''f(y)&amp;ge; g(y)'' for all ''y'' on ''[c,d]''. Now, as before we can divide the interval into ''n'' subintervals and create rectangles to approximate the area between ''f(y)'' and ''g(y)''. It may be useful to picture each rectangle having their 'width', ''&amp;Delta;y'', parallel to the ''y''-axis and 'height', ''f(y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)-g(y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)'' at the point ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*'', parallel to the ''x''-axis. Following from the work above we may reason that an ''approximation'' of the area, ''A'', between the two curves is 
:&lt;math&gt; A := \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(y_{i}^{*})-g(y_{i}^{*})]\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;. 
As before, we take the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity to arrive at 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(y_{i}^{*})-g(y_{i}^{*})]\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;, 
which is nothing more than a definite integral, so
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_c^d[f(y)-g(y)]\,dy&lt;/math&gt;. 
Regardless of the form of the functions, we basically use the same formula.

=== Harmonic Mean ===
The arithmetic mean cannot be used when we want to average quantities such as speed.

Consider the example below:

'''Example 1:''' The distance from my house to town is 40 km. I drove to town at a speed of 40 km per hour and returned home at a speed of 80 km per hour. What was my average speed for the whole trip?.

'''Solution:''' If we just took the arithmetic mean of the two speeds I drove at, we would get 60 km per hour. This isn't the correct average speed, however: it ignores the fact that I drove at 40 km per hour for twice as long as I drove at 80 km per hour. To find the correct average speed, we must instead calculate the harmonic mean.

For two quantities A and B, the harmonic mean is given by: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified by adding in the denominator and multiplying by the reciprocal:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B}} = \frac{2}{\frac{B + A}{AB}} = \frac{2AB}{A + B}&lt;/math&gt;

For N quantities: A, B, C......

Harmonic mean = &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B} + \frac{1}{C} + \ldots}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us try out the formula above on our example:

Harmonic mean = &lt;math&gt;\frac{2AB}{A + B}&lt;/math&gt;

Our values are A = 40, B = 80. Therefore, harmonic mean &lt;math&gt;= \frac{2 \times 40 \times 80}{40 + 80}= \frac{6400}{120} \approx 53.333&lt;/math&gt;

Is this result correct? We can verify it. In the example above, the distance between the two towns is 40 km.  So the trip from A to B at a speed of 40 km will take 1 hour. The trip from B to A at a speed to 80 km will take 0.5 hours. The total time taken for the round distance (80 km) will be 1.5 hours. The average speed will then be &lt;math&gt;\frac{80}{1.5} \approx&lt;/math&gt; 53.33 km/hour.

The harmonic mean also has physical significance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Wikibook for Calculus already covers some portion of Diffrential equations, including a rather complete ''introduction'' to ODE. I think it would save time and effort to expand on that section, and make DE a part of that book. Over a period of time, other higher level books would also be integrated into calucus (such as series, complex analysis,etc).



Sorry for not reading this sooner, I was on vacation for the 4th.  I'm not sure I agree this should be part of another book, although I'm willing to discuss it further.  DE is a rather large and complex topic, easily a college semester even with barely touching partials.  I think adding it into one giant book would be doing a disservice to both subjects-  it would make the calculus book so huge as to be daunting to readers, and make the DE part a side note when it deserves more attention.  I guess my mindset is more of the Unix philosophy as applied to books-  do one thing, and do it well.  Tieing things together into courses of study (calc, then DE, then linear algebra (or whatever order)) is the job of a higher order layer.

I took a quick glance at the DE section of the Calculus book.  Its well written and covers a lot of ground.  The problem I have with it is that it doesn't *teach* DE.  Its a problem I have with a lot of wikibooks.  Its a good reminder, if I wanted to review the subject it would work well.  But if I had never solved a DE before and was studying the subject for the first time, I would be utterly lost.  It has few examples, no practice problems and answers, little explanation of why things worked, no discussing of the theory behind the methods, nothing of the practical applications.  It reads more like an encyclopedia entry than a book.  Which makes sense, given the nature of wikibooks springing from wikipedia.  And its better than the average wikibook out there, having read many that looked like powerpoint slides.  But still of low use as a classroom or self teaching aid.

Which brings us to another issue on adding this DE to the calculus book.  I don't want the book to look like the standard wikipedia style.  I don't like the standard style, being too much encyclopedia and not enough book.  Given that I won't be using the same style, I'm not sure that it would be a good idea to assimilate the content into one book.  Within a book, IMHO, one ought to make an attempt to keep the style of the information the same.  To do otherwise is confusing.  And while I have no doubt my style will have its own deficiencies and I'm happy to listen for impovements, I doubt you'll be able to convince me to switch to standard wikibook style.

Just laying out some ideas for a brief reformation, im going to write some things on the formation of differential equations before the tackling of the concept of a solution so as to provide what I hope will be a more intuitive and understanding approach.[[User:Robert Carr|Robert Carr]] 03:38, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

It's a shame to see this book neglected -- it would be a really nice resource to have an online book on DEs. I think I'll write some content for it. I've already written Variation of Parameters (under Constant Coefficients) and maybe I'll also add something about Laplace transforms, which are really fun and powerful. Perhaps I'll even do a section on series solutions if I'm feeling bold.... [[User:N Shar|N Shar]] 05:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Please do.  I'm sorry the book has become neglected as well-  I just don't have time to add to it these days.  And on top of that, I lack the confidence in some of the more advanced material-  I am not a math professor.  As the material gets more advanced I felt more like I was regurgitating source books than I was writing from my understanding of the material.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 19:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

==Relationship of this book with the Wikipedia entry on Ordinary Differential Equations==

Reading the current version of the Wikipedia entry on ordinary differential equations, it seems to me that much of that material belongs in  a textbook, rather than an encyclopedia entry. I think the encyclopedia should have definitions and motivation for studying the material. I have written a comment to that effect on the wikipedia article, and I'm in the process of writing some of that material for the wikipedia article.


Now as far as the wikibook is concerned, I think the title shhould be &quot;Ordinary Differential Equations&quot;, because that describes the content. My background is in partial differential equations, so I'd like to advance that side of the wiki enterprise, but I think ODE comes first logically. I'm now retired with some time on my hands, so I'd like to help with any or all of these enterprises. So far I haven't been able to get a wikibooks ID, but my wikipedia ID is &quot;donludwig&quot;. Email is ludwig@math.ubc.ca [[User:154.5.94.9|154.5.94.9]] 17:46, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

==Book Development==
I'm currently studying Diff EQ and would like to contribute to this book. This is the second time I've taken this course, and I feel that there are many students out there that would benifit from a free resource that could explain topics from a non-textbook-writer point of view. More importantly, I'd like to expand the example problems to cover as many examples as possible since this is the main way of learning any subject: practice. Please contact me so that we can discuss further development at curtwulf at gmail dot com. Thanks. [[User:Curtwulf|Curtwulf]] 12:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Definitions ==

Arnold defines an ODE as follows.
An ODE is a process evolving in time that has the following 3 characteristics:
(1) deterministic
(2) finite dimensional
(3) differentiable.
where deterministic means that the entire past and future of a process is determined by its initial value.
finite dimensional means that the set of all possible states of your process (the phase space) can locally be parametrized by 
finite many real numbers (eg.: a sphere can locally be parametrized by two real numbers, so does the plane, the real line, etc).  Differentiability means that the time evolution processes can be described by an equation that is differentible.

I like this approach to ODE's by Arnold better then the one normaly found at books because it is more conceptual.

----

Response: With all due respect to Arnold, that definition is too narrow for many practical purposes.  It focuses on &quot;processes evolving in time&quot; which is not the only situation where ODEs arise.  For example, it excludes boundary value problems in which case the description &quot;the entire past and future of a process is determined by its initial value&quot; makes no sense.

Furthermore, the requirement (3) is too restrictive.  Consider, for instance, the differential equation y'(t) + y(t) = f(t) where f is a step function.  Such equations arise all the time in electronic circuits; the step in f corresponds to throwing a switch.  The solution y is continuous but not differentiable.  Of course, to make sense of the differential equation, we need to view it as an integral equation, as in:

   y(t) = y(0) + int&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; [ f(t) - y(t) ] dt

which is what one does when proving the existence and uniqueness theorems anyway.

== Reformat ==
I'd like to create a standard layout for accessing the examples, problems, and answers, like at the end of the page explaning the topic so the confusion in the chapter on First Order Equations doesn't happen.

== Calculus category ==

Given that most universities list this course as &quot;Calculus ##&quot; (usually IV), I feel like it would make sense to include this in the Calculus category. I didn't find out about this book existing until looking at the discussion of the DE section of the Calculus textbook, and the first place I looked for it was in the Calculus section. Support? [[User:XarBiogeek|XarBiogeek]] ([[User talk:XarBiogeek|talk]]) 08:34, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

:My experience is that the topics covered at most universities in a course such as &quot;Calculus IV&quot; would not go into the depth that is aimed for in the current book.  So in general I suppose I don't think it would work to include the book in the Calculus category.  Maybe we could provide a link from the Calculus subject to the subject on Differential equations to aid in people finding this book.  Out of curiosity how did you calculus book that lead you here.  It has always been a question as to how our readers find the books they are looking for.

== Books title ==

I am interested in renaming this book, as it's current title seems a bit too broad to me.  I was thinking something along the lines of &quot;Ordinary Differential Equations&quot;, but maybe working in &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Introductory&quot;, etc. What do other people think?

== Roadmap ==

Hi, I'm new to editing this book.  It would be extremely beneficial if there were a plan regarding what to add.  That is especially true since there are a limited number of volunteers contributing, and they each have a limited amount of time to give.  Currently the &quot;Roadmap&quot; page is only a red link from the table of contents.

To move this book toward completion we should focus on finishing the essentials before adding peripheral material; consider what you would find in an elementary differential equations book for college undergraduates.

Thank you all.  I hope this book grows quickly!

== Formation of Differential Equations==
I think this section of the book should go.  It does not add to the study of the subject, and is distracting for a pedagogical prospective.  From a practical point of view it is backwards, as usually you are looking for the unknown function that solves an ODE.  Overall it just doesn't add to the text. If there are no objections I will remove it. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:49, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
: In absence of any objections, I have deleted the section. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:01, 28 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

三日間前 (さんにちかんまえ) is wrong. The correct one is 三日前 (みっかまえ). And also 十日間　(じゅうにちかん) is to be 十日間(とおかかん). One exception exists when saying `for a day': 一日(いちにち). いっか ikka is to be いちにち ichinichi. --[[User:K12u|K12u]] 3 July 2005 16:25 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[:Category:Rhubarb recipes|Rhubarb Recipes]]
__NOTOC__
This pie is fairly sweet, but also quite tangy. It is best served warm with a scoop of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|Flaky Pie Crust]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (1100g) of [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]] stalks (about 2 1/2 pounds)
* 1 &amp; 1/2 cups (360ml) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/4 cup of (60ml) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Tapioca|tapioca]] pearls
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

===Crust===
# Prepare the [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|flaky pie crust]] and refrigerate while preparing the rhubarb.

===Filling===
# Clean and trim the rhubarb stalks.
# Cut the stalks into 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5cm) sections.
# Add sugar, cornstarch or tapioca, and salt.
# Stir until rhubarb is evenly coated with dry ingredients.

Image:05-filling_ingredients.jpg|dry ingredients for filling
Image:06-filling_mixed.jpg|mixed fruit and dry ingredients for pie filling
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Forming and cooking the pie===
# Follow the instructions in the [[Cookbook:Flaky_Pie_Crust#To_Form_a_Covered_Pie|flaky pie crust]] recipe.

Place pie on lowest rack in oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking for 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If cornstarch is used as the thickener, the pie requires a longer cooling time before the filling is gelled.

* Another variation is to use a whole egg in the mix.

* This cookbook also has a recipe for [[Cookbook:Strawberry Rhubarb Pie|strawberry rhubarb pie]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==C++==
C++ is an [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language derived from [[Software Engineers Handbook:Language Dictionary:Procedural:C|C]].

===Type===
C++ is a full, [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language implementing the following paradigmen: [[w:Generic programming|generic]] ([[w:template|template]] [[w:metaprogramming|metaprogramming]]), [[w:Imperative programming|imperative]] and [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] ([[w:Class (computer science)|class-based]])

===Execution Entry Point===
An executable starts with the main() method.

===General Syntax===
The typical statement is completed by a semi-colon.  For the assignment of b to a use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 a = b;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Comments===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 // this is an inline comment.  Everything after the // is a comment.
&lt;/source&gt;

Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
Declarations can appear anywhere in the implementation.

Declare i as an integer: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int i;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here are two ways to declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int i = 0;
 int i(0);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Methods are declared by specifying the interface for the method.  It is often declared within the scope of a class.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 return_type function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name, 
                           default_argument_type default_arg_name = default_arg_value);
&lt;/source&gt;

Method implementation repeats much of the same information
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 return_type class_name::function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name, 
                           default_argument_type default_arg_name)
 {
     // work with arg_1_name, arg_2_name, and default_arg_name
     // depending on the argument types the variables are passed by 
     //   value, reference, or are constant
     // don't forget to return something of the return type
     return 36;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

''IMPORTANT POINT''  A beginner in C/C++ might get confused about the distinction between how pointers are declared in a function prototype vs. how the function is defined.  For example, if my_function does not return anything, but accepts one floating point input, its function prototype looks as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 void my_function(float *some_variable); 
&lt;/source&gt;

However, if the variable my_var is defined to be a pointer to a float, for example: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 float *my_var; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Then the manner in which my_function is invoked is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 my_function(my_var); 
&lt;/source&gt;

Beginners sometimes get confused about the fact that a &quot;*&quot; is used to tell the compiler in a prototype statment that a variable is a pointer, but a &quot;*&quot; is not syntactically used during invocation of a function that accepts a pointer as input.

===Scope===
Scope is defined by curly braces.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 { // this the the beginning of a scope
     // the scope is about to end
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Conditional Statements===
If and only if A is equal to B assign C to D, otherwise, assign E to F.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 if( A == B )
 {
     D = C;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is equal to B
 }
 else
 {
     F = E;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is not equal to B
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

or
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 if( A == B ) 
     D = C; //more lines of code are not permitted after this statement
 else
     F = E;
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, a switch statement can be used for multiple choice operations.  This sample converts a number input to text.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 switch( number_value )
 {
     case 37:
         text = &quot;thirty-seven&quot;;
         break; // this line prevents the program from writing over this value with the
                //   following code
     case 23:
         text = &quot;twenty-three&quot;;
         break;
     default: // this is used if none of the previous cases contain the value
         text = &quot;unknown number&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Looping Statements===
This code counts from 0 to 9, adding up the contents of the array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int i = 0;
 for( int index = 0; index &lt; 10; index = index + 1 )
 {
     i = array[index];
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This code repeats until the number 4 is found.  If this runs off of the end of the array, there could be a problem.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int index = 0;
 while( 4 != array[index] )
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This code increments the counter before the check is made, so that it starts with element 1.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int index = 0;
 do
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }
 while( 4 != array[index] );
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output Statements===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 printf( &quot;%s&quot;,&quot;Hello world!\n&quot; );
&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Containers===
The standard template library has a variety of containers including vector, bit-set, list, map and multi-set.

===Algorithms===
The standard template library has a variety of algorithms including sort, remove_if, and find_if.

===Garbage collection===
Garbage collection is manual.

===Physical Structure===
Generally the interfaces are defined in header files, often *.h.  The implementation files are often named *.cpp.  Useful collections of classes can be compiled into libraries, often *.dll, *.a, or *.so, which can be compiled into executables (statically linked) or used on the fly (dynamically linked).

===Tips===
Don't confuse these two:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 =  // assignment
 == // comparison, is equal to
&lt;/source&gt;

Often using the one you don't want will compile, and will produce results you did not expect.

A good practice is to write; if(CONSTANT == variable) rather than if(variable == CONSTANT) since the compiler will catch; if(CONSTANT = variable) but not if(variable = CONSTANT).

Arrays start with index 0.

Coquito is a Puerto Rican coconut egg-nog served on Christmas and New year's. The drink is often served in a shot glass garnished with nutmeg and cinnamon. 

==Ingredients==
* 4 egg yolks
* 6oz can cream of coconut (Coco-Lopez)
* 12oz can evaporated milk
* 14oz can of coconut milk or home made
* 14oz can sweetened condensed milk
* 4oz rum
* 3 cinnamon sticks
* 2 star anise 
* 1 cup of water
* 1/4 tsp of whole cloves
* ground nutmeg and cinnamon for garnish
* 1 vanilla bean or 1 tsp vanilla extract

==Directions==

# In the top of a double boiler, combine egg yolks and evaporated milk. Stirring constantly, cook over lightly simmering water until mixture reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
# First remove the seeds from vanilla skin. Hold the bean down on either end. With the tip of a paring knife, poke a hole in the top and slide it down the bean, splitting it in half lengthwise. Open it with the knife tip and scrape down, collecting the seeds on the blade.
# Start by boiling the vanilla seeds and skin (not vanilla extract), cinnamon sticks, clove and star anise in the 1 cups of water. Reduce to 1/2 cup. When the water turns yellow and has the smell and you can taste the spices, take the spices out.
# Add coconut milk, cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk to spiced water and stir over medium heat for 3 minutes or until a slight boil. Remove and cool.
# Once cool mix in eggs, rum and vanilla extract if using extract.  
# Refrigerator serve cold in shot glasses, or with ice in tumblers. Garnish with nutmeg and cinnamon.
(NOTE: It is extremely important that you make sure there are as little clumps in the mixture as possible!)</text>

==Ingredients:==
*One 4 1/2-pound (2.5kg) [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] shoulder
*1 1/2 tablespoons kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*12 medium [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, peeled
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*2 tablespoons whole dry [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*2 tablespoons fresh [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]  
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*2 tablespoon white wine vinegar

==Directions:== 
# Wash the pork shoulder. 
# Skin side down with a sharp knife make incisions in different places of the pork shoulder. 
# Grind together the garlic, pepper, oregano, and salt
# When done grinding add in oil and vinegar and mix well.  
# Fill the incisions of the pork.  
# What ever is left over rub on the outside of the pork.  
# Put away in the refrigerator for 3 days. 
# If you planned to cook it the same day, prepare the pork at least 1 hour ahead of time. 
# Remove the pork shoulder from the refrigerator 2 hours before putting it in the oven. 
# Preheat the oven at 350ºF (180°C) for at least 10 minutes before you begin cooking the pork shoulder. 
# Cook the pork for 3 1/2 hours. 
# Raise the temperature to 375°F (195°C) and cook for 15 to 30 minutes until the skin is toasted and browned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reflexive verbs indicate that the action of the verb reflects back on the subject. In their infinitive forms, reflexive verbs end in -se.


Examples:
*'''lavarse'''- to wash oneself
*'''vestirse'''- to dress oneself

Conjugation requires removing the -se ending and conjugating normally. The reflexive pronouns are then placed before the conjugated form of the verb.

'''Lavarse'''
:yo '''me''' lavo - I wash myself
:tú '''te''' lavas - you wash yourself
:él/ella/Ud. '''se''' lava - he/she/it washes himself/herself/itself
:nosotros '''nos''' lavamos - we wash ourselves
:vosotros '''os''' laváis - you (plural) wash yourselves
:ellos/ellas/Uds. '''se''' lavan - they wash themselves

'''Vestirse'''
:yo '''me''' visto - I dress myself
:tú '''te''' vistes - you dress yourself
:él/ella/Ud. '''se''' viste - he/she/it dresses himself/herself/itself
:nosotros '''nos''' vestimos - we dress ourselves
:vosotros '''os''' vestís - you (plural) dress yourselves
:ellos/ellas/Uds. '''se''' visten - they dress themselves

Reflexive verbs often have to do with personal hygiene, grooming, and dressing:

*'''peinarse'''- to brush one's hair
*'''maquillarse'''- to make-up oneself
*'''cepillarse (los dientes)'''- to brush one's teeth
*'''bañarse'''- to bathe oneself

Remember that the reflexive pronoun (me, te, se, etc.) ''must'' be included with the verb, even if the subject pronoun (yo, tú, él, etc.) is not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the wikipedia entry for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_standard coding standards].

Coding standards generally contain a set of conventions for a specific language.  Items typically covered are:
*Naming conventions including:
**how descriptive and long the names should be,
**what the capitalization scheme should be, and
**what the postfix and prefix conventions are.
*Physical organization, such as ''Definitions shall be located in the header files.'' and ''Do not include more than one class in one file.''
*Structure conventions, such as ''Opening and closing braces shall be located in the same column like this:
 {
     {
         // code in here
     }
 }''
*Style guides, such as ''Classes containing pointers shall have a virtual destructor.''  It is useful to include the reasoning and references for this type of standard.
*Legacy code guidance, such as ''When editing existing code, follow the coding naming and structure conventions of the existing code.''

==C++==

*''Effective C++:  55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs'' by Scott Meyers (ISBN 0321334876) is a reference for creating style guides.
*''More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs'' by Scott Meyers (ISBN 020163371X) is a reference for creating style guides.

==Eiffel==
*[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~smithja/MIMS/DataModel/development/plan/eiffel_coding_standard.html ww.cs.unc.edu standard]

== Naming conventions ==

''&quot;Always, always, always use good, unabbreviated, correctly-spelled meaningful names.&quot; -- [[c2: MeaningfulName]]''

Popular naming conventions (naming formats) include:

*ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
*all_lowercase_with_underscores
*CamelCase
*uppercaseOnlyInTheMiddle
*_UnderscorePrefixedCamelCase
*Camel_Case_With_Underscores

For surprisingly long conversations about naming conventions, see
[[c2: UnderscoreVersusCapitalAndLowerCaseVariableNaming]];
[[Wikipedia: CamelCase]]; [[c2: CamelCase]]; and [http://echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=15752 &quot;Underscores vs CamelCase&quot;].

==The United States and The Great War==

===Why didn't the United States enter the war before [[w:1917|1917]]?===

===Impact of the entry of the United States to the war===
# War at sea
#* big increase merchant marine (including interned German vessels)
#* big increase shipbuilding capacity
#* big increase anti-submarine forces
# Effect on battlefield
#* very limited [[w:1917|1917]], but significant latter part of defence against German offensives in [[w:1918|1918]], counterattacks
#* two million fresh troops in France by end war

#* much appeal to nationalities in Austro-Hungarian Empire
#* basis for German agreement to armistice
# American influence over war and peace
#* control over finance and resources
#* creation of [[w:League of Nations|League of Nations]]

== Factors contributing to likelihood of conflict ==

# Nationalism
#* in [[w:Balkans|Balkans]], within [[w:Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]] and in major nation-states
#* fueled drive both to change and to mantain status quo—drive to become world power, fear that would lose great power status
#* resistance to actions or policies that might harm national prestige
# Imperialism
#* no evidence that capitalist interests pushed for war in accordance with Leninist argument
#* imperialism outside Europe often exaggerated as factor—settlement of imperial disputes in wider world more a feature of [[w:1900|1900]]-[[w:1914|14]] period (and previously more conflict between Britain and France, Russia)
#* resentment in Germany that denied &quot;place in the sun&quot;
#* French-German confrontation over [[w:Morocco|Morocco]] in [[w:1905|1905]] and [[w:1911|1911]] helped cement [[w:Entente Cordiale|Entente Cordiale]] (French for &quot;friendly understanding&quot;)
#* Italian attack on Turkey to seize territory ([[w:1911|1911]]-[[w:1912|12]]) weakened Turkish power further
#* Austro-Hungarian designs on Serbia a form of imperialism, supported by Germany
# Alliance System
#* ostensibly means by which Russia, Germany and France drawn into a conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia
#* importance can be exaggerated—some moral influence (and possible resulting domestic political considerations), but alliances generally embody real interests and become operative because those interests are threatened or can be advanced
#* no formal alliance between Russia and Sebia, or Britain and France
# Arms Races
#* naval competition soured relations between Britain and Germany
#* heightened tension as Russia and France built up their armies in response to Germany—temptation of latter to strike first (especially as many in government perceived that could not compete in medium term)
# Military Planning/Technological Improvements in Mobilization
#* importance of railway timetables, quick decisions
#* French-British military talks implied some commitment
# Changes in Existing Power Balance
#* unification of Germany and its rapid industrial development and population growth
#* rapid economic development of Russia
#* decline of Turkey
#* rise of Serbia
# Internal Pressures
#* definite fear in Austria-Hungary
#* problem for German Imperial Government—rise of [[w:Social democracy|Social Democrats]], rise of nationalistic anti-Socialist parties
#* fear of nationalist backlash in Russia and possibly France if backed down from confrontation
#* internal problems in Britain tended to exert pressure against involvement in war
# Misjudgement of Nature of Coming War
#* widespread belief that it would have to end quickly, presumably with a conference, after decisive war of movement
# Ideological and Moral Influences
#* glorification of war and self-sacrifice made for widespread acceptance amongst populations
#* concepts of &quot;honor&quot;
#* some perception of ideological conflict—Russian [[w:Autocracy|autocracy]], German [[w:Militarism|militarism]], French [[w:Republicanism|republicanism]]; religious divisions
#* some affected by ideologies of power and necessary conflict; concepts of [[w:Social Darwinism|Social Darwinism]], ideas of [[w:Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] *but fear stronger than &quot;will to power&quot; amongst most decisionmakers)

== Reasons for the decisions of individual governments ==

===Austria-Hungary Attacks Serbia [[w:July 28|July 28]]===
* assassination of [[w:Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] by Serbs almost certainly supported by elements in Serbian military; refusal by Serbia to accept all demands unconditionally
* more fundamental reason: desire to crush perceived growing Serbian threat by absorbing Serbia
** Austro-Hungarian nationality problem, acute in Balkans area
** close relations between Serbia and Russia, the main power threat to Austria-Hungary
** Serbia aggressively nationalistic since [[w:1903|1903]], looking to unite with Serbs and Croats in Turky and Austria-Hungary
** [[w:1905|1905]]-[[w:1909|09]] failure of &quot;[[w:Pig War|pig war]]&quot;
** [[w:1908|1908]] Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzgovina increases Serb hostility
** [[w:1912|1912]]-[[w:1913|13]] Serbia greatly increases its territory and proves militarily effective in the [[w:Balkan Wars|Balkan Wars]]
* support of Germany—[[w:July 5|July 5]] &quot;blank cheque&quot;

===Russia Mobilizes (partially [[w:July 29|July 29]], generally [[w:July 30|July 30]])===
* belief that they should not abandon Serbia
** fellow Slavs, fellow [[w:Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]
** would lose a strategic advantage against Austria-Hungary
** would suffer immense loss of prestige internationally and domestically
*** had suffered defeat in war [[w:1904|1904]]-[[w:1905|05]], [[w:1908|1908]] had not intervened when Bosnia annexed, [[w:1913|1913]] had allowed Serbia to be deprived of an [[w:Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline following Balkan Wars
* believed had chance of winning war following rapid recovery since [[w:1905|1905]]
* a successful war could lead to Russian control over the [[w:Strait|straits]] between the [[w:Black Sea|Black Sea]] and the [[w:Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] (specifically, the [[w:Bosporus|Bosporus]] and the [[w:Dardanelles|Dardanelles]])—important for trade, especially grain exports
* [[w:1913|1913]] German military mission to Turky ([[w:Otto Liman von Sanders|Liman von Sanders]])—belief that German influence there increasing
* Tsar persuaded by military and French ambassador to carry out general mobilization on grounds that war with Germany inevitable

===Germany Declares War on Russia ([[w:August 1|August 1]])===
* Austria-Hungary Germany's only reliable ally ([[w:Dual Alliance, 1879|1879 Dual Alliance]])—believed could not afford to see it defeated or dismembered
* Russia allied with France, Germany's major opponent in western Europe
* planning for war assumed Austro-Hungarian attack on Russia
* belief that faced growing danger from Russia (building railways, industrialization, greater military effectiveness)—military in particular argue that best to strike early, before Russian reorganization and expansion of military complete ([[w:1917|1917]])
* defeat of Russia could open up economic opportunities in eastern Europe
* likely that war against &quot;autocratic&quot;, brutal Russian threat would be popular domestically

===Germany Declares War on France and Invades Belgium ([[w:August 3|August 3]])===
* superficially due to France's refusal to pledge neutrality and surrender its eastern forts
* Germany considers France an irreconcilable opponent because of German annexation of [[w:Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine]] in [[w:1871|1871]]
* France allied with Russia in [[w:1892|1892]] and had been deploying much of its capital surplus to build infrastructure (especially railways) and industry in Russia
* France moving to expand its military forces in response to German expansion, but not ready until [[w:1915|1915]]-[[w:1916|16]]
* German military plans ([[w:Schlieffen Plan|von Schlieffen Plan]]) call for a rapid attack on France before Russia can fully mobilize and attack Germany (Kaiser told cannot mobilize solely against Russia—railway timetables)
* need to secure rapid passage through neutral Belgium on a narrow front (partly because had decided in [[w:1911|1911]] not to violate neutrality of Netherlands)
* had come to accept likelihood of British intervention (formation of [[w:Entente Cordiale|Entente Cordiale]] [[w:1904|1904]], [[w:Triple Entente|Triple Entente]] [[w:1907|1907]], attitude in two Moroccan crises), but considered not significant militarily and now better prepared with completion improvement [[w:Kiel Canal|Kiel Canal]]

===Britain Declares War on Germany ([[w:August 4|August 4]])===
* since [[w:1880s|1880s]] had come to regard Germany as its likely enemy in a future European war ([[w:Kruger telegram|Kruger telegram]] [[w:1896|1896]], attitude during [[w:Boer War|South African War]] [[w:1899|1899]]-[[w:1902|1902]], [[w:First Moroccan Crisis|Tangier Crisis]] [[w:1905|1905]]-[[w:1906|06]], [[w:Agadir Crisis|Agadir Crisis]] [[w:1911|1911]], '''above all''' because of large-scale German naval construction since [[w:1898|1898]]—naval supremacy seen as basis of British power and security)
* widespread belief that defeat of France would upset balance of power in Europe and lead to possibility of German naval bases in northern France and Low Countries—intolerable threat
* British military had been cooperating with French military in planning for several years—implied commitment
* [[w:Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] ([[w:Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]) convinced that Britain had to get involved
* German attack on neutral Belgium gave additional justification and moral basis (particularly strong in influencing public opinion)

==War Enthusiasm==
Aim to give overview of social, economic, political and military issues of war
*It was an industrialised war, at the end of a long period of industrialisation for Britain and, more recently, Germany so these had an effect
*Way war remembered in 20th c., architecture, monuments, etc.
*During 90s it got &quot;vogue&quot;ish

===Middle classes===
* &quot;pals battallions&quot; were method of recruiting in Britain
* esp. linked to notion of &quot;the city&quot;
* represented by &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;

===War Enthusiasm===
* [[w:1914|1914]] - historians often speak of the &quot;rush to the colours&quot; in this year
** also general atmosphere of war enthusiasm
* is this true to all classes?
* should we question some commonly-held assumptions about war enthusiasm?
* on eve of war in [[w:1914|1914]] Britain had experienced several decades of economic growth
* when war broke out British army fairly small
** their navy was bigger than their army!
* most of the army was in India defending the &quot;Jewel of the crown&quot; as Disraeli called it
* the army wasn’t something you’d see as a career move!
** it was often home to the dregs of society in 19th c.
** English *wanted* the army posted abroad for fear of what would happen if it stayed in Britain
** there were military camps like Aldersharp/shark (sp?) but most was still kept overseas
* officers from middle of 19th c. came from upper classes; had gone thru public school education
* the army was short of 11,000 men when war broke out
** this triggered Kitchener’s desire for new army
* he produced a well-known poster where his eyes followed you around the room
** &quot;Your country needs YOU!&quot; poster art took off in WW1
** US later adapted this for Uncle Sam because it was so effective
* the army went thru big changes in WW1; the existing army, the old Contemptibles (BEF) as well as the Territorials
* but now there were 2 new armies coming thru
** those volunteers Kitchener managed to raise
** and in [[w:1916|1916]], another army made up of those forced to fight!
* Britain brought in laws to ''force'' you to fight at the Front; conscription was introduced
* highly contentious b/c liberal gov that was in power was supposed to be about freedom of choice!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word ''apocrypha'' in Bibliology refers to texts that are not considered canonical, part of the Bible, but are of roughly similar style and age as the accepted Scriptures. Protestants use the word ''apocryph'', in a narrower sense, of those books that they exclude from their canon of Scripture, but that other Churches view as canonical and venerate as divinely inspired, written under the influence of the Holy Spirit. 

Disagreement between Christian Churches is almost non-existent about the canon of the New Testament, but the inclusion of some books in the Old Testament canon is disputed. Since these books were of late composition, Protestant scholars sometimes call them ''intertestamenta'', i.e. intermediate between the Old and New Testaments, and hold that God imposed a period of silence, with no prophecy or Scripture, to prepare for the coming of Jesus.

The books that come under the description ''apocryph'' in the broad sense but not in this narrow sense are called apocrypha by Catholics and Jews, but Protestants usually call them ''Pseudepigrapha''. Many of them have apocalyptic themes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is created to assist in the organization of the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|Vandalism]] page. It contains information previously posted on the Specials page that is collated to give a better overview of multi-session vandalism.

= Vandalism =

The ideal behind Wikibooks (and in general Wikiprojects) is really the sharing and consolidation of human knowledge. If you look back in history, you would realise how much knowledge we take for granted.

Take for example the PC you are using. Each PC is a cummulation of human knowledge in:
:* material sciences (to know that it is possible to construct a PC from base material)
:* geology (locating the oil and silicon, plus other material such as gold)
:* mining/ drilling (to extract said material)
:* chemistry and metallurgy (to refine the material)
:* construction, electronics and robotics (to create the production facilities needed to produce the PC)
:* power generation (to power the PC)
:* mathematics, logic and computer sciences (to create OS and applications to run the PC)
:* ....

I can just go on and on, but the point is, it is impossible for any ONE person on this planet to create a PC from, say, a pool of crude oil and a lump of ore. The knowledge needed to turn ''black gold'' and raw ore into the PC you are using now has way too many specialist areas that requires dedication to master.

Thus, a critical loss of knowledge in even ONE area will mean the total loss of ability by humanity to create more PCs; without the computational muscles computing brings us, humanity cannot progress beyond where we are now.

Wikibooks, in its own way, tries to preserve some parts of the knowledge. The motivation, effort and dedication of true contributors here are all diverse, but we need not question them; that they bothered to set aside time to key in such information is already something I personally am thankful for.

So, I view vandalism with a very dim light. In many ways, vandals are not showing respect for the efforts of others -- they deserve no respect from me then. They are threatening what we as a collective whole tries to build, all for the cheap thrill of destroying the works of others. That is something unforgivable, at least in my opinion.

Wikibooks is getting more and more popular as time goes by. Now, in about half a day, we have about 500 edits; approximately 1% is vandalism, plus another 1% in newcomer mistakes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to quickly narrow down the vandals as they often hide behind the anonymity that is at the core of the Wiki ideal. It makes it necessary for other contributors to dedicate time to check the entries to make sure that no vandalism undo the works of others. 

Not only that, these contributors need to maintain an objectivity to leave coherent subjective books alone, while rooting out the true vandals; some Wikibooks are truly offensive or subjective, yet in the sum of human knowledge, these books are a ''necessary'' evil. It is however not the place of these contributors -- let's call them ''Patrollers'' to pass judgement on the appropriateness of a well-developed Wikibook.

Wikibooks badly need more Patrollers. As more users come to utilize Wikibooks more than Wikipedia (which, by definition, is more restrictive), the percentage of vandalism is likely to increase (but thankfully, self-patrols will also go up). As it is, we are hard pressed to catch vandals and react swiftly enough to minimize the damage they cause. We need to breed a group of contributors who are sufficiently civic-conscious to do what is needed, without the benefits of material rewards or acknowledgement.

== Ass Pus Attacks ==

The '''Ass Pus Attacks''' are a series of attacks that has the same MO:

# A named user attacks [[:Image:WikiThanks.png]] by changing the image (a sunflower) into that of the words &quot;Ass Pus&quot; (hence the name of this section). As this image is used by several official pages, it is a quick way to vandalize mulitple files.
# The user uploads various crude images and link them to editable official pages like this page.
# The user can also start moving official pages to pages that has the name &quot;Ass Pus&quot; in them.


To date, the following users are known to use this attack. These users have been blocked.

:* [[Special:Contributions/Duke of Puke|Duke of Puke]] (First known instance.)
:* [[Special:Contributions/Greeno|Greeno]] (Partial; blocked by [[User:Waerth|Waerth]] before full damage is done but uploaded signature &quot;Ass Pus&quot; image. Reconstructed from audit trail.)
:* [[Special:Contributions/Henry the 88th|Henry the 88th]] (Observed in full by me ([[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]]).)
:* [[Special:Contributions/Ting Tong|Ting Tong]] (Not observed by me ([[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]]) but has signature style.)

The following is a record of the various information posted by various admins/ contributors at the time of the attack. These are copied from the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|Vandalism]] page.

=== [[Special:Contributions/Duke of Puke|Duke of Puke]] ===
He's vandalizing pages and templates.  He needs to be banned.  Homepage is a redirect. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 06:09, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)
* I had to move it back.  He moved [[User:TUF-KAT]] to his own page, and also moving key policy pages around (including this page) and giving them offensive names.  User's userpage is currently a redirect to [[User:TUF-KAT]] as a result. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:11, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*He's been blocked. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 06:58, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Special:Contributions/Henry the 88th|Henry the 88th]] ===
Vandal. U/led inappropriate image [[:Image:Gap8.jpg|here]], vandalized 4 pages including 1 Template page. The other template he inserted a standard wiki img so I'm going to leave it alone. Suspected alias of [[Special:Contributions/Duke_of_Puke|Duke of Puke]] et. al., please block ASAP.

: Okay, I'm officially very confused by all the edits I had to get this guy off our backs. Can someone please go through his &quot;Contributions&quot; to make sure I got them all? [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 07:45, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Yeah, I was going to help you fix it, but it's beyond my mere mortal powers. Could an admin please roll back all changes by everyone involved, if that's possible. Congratulations on detecting Henry the 88th first Lynx7725, I was distracted by looking at only the anonymous edits. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 07:59, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: No probs. Hopefully he doesn't resurface or an admin blocks him for good. This guy (assuming all are aliases of one guy) sure has (a) a grudge against wikibooks and (b) a fascination on anal biological processes... [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 08:06, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::::Just ignore him, and he will go away. He thrives on attention. We can easily fix up his mess after he has gone. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 08:12, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

As a precaution, can I request that [[:Image:WikiThanks.png]] be protected? The attacks from Henry the 88th, Ting Tong, Duke of Puke (and suspect Gumba Gumba) all had similar styles, and of late (since Ting Tong) they have kept attacking this image as it is a commonly used image in Wikibooks. I'll willing to bet money the next wave from this person/ persons will also target this image. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 08:37, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Update: Seems like I missed the last Duke of Puke sockpuppet attack, this time under the name [[Special:Contributions/Greeno|Greeno]]. Same MO (i.e. attacked the WikiThanks.png with the same image as previous attacks. [[User:Waerth|Waerth]] blocked him before too much damage is done.

: Can we protect this image to stop these attacks? Granted, he can still u/l the image under another name, but at least he would not be able to affect so many pages with one edit. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 10:29, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Special:Contributions/Ting Tong|Ting Tong]] ===
He moved this page to Wikibooks:Ass pus in progress. And vadalized a few other pages with the same text. -- [[User:Bobdoe|Bobdoe]] ([[User talk:Bobdoe|Silence]]) 18:25, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:I've just undone their page move, please block them ASAP. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 02:51, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cuisine|Trinidad and Tobago}} | [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean cuisines]]

The Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago is indicative of the blends of Amerindian, European, African, Indian, Chinese, Creole, and Lebanese gastronomic influences, and is also more similar to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Guyana|cuisine of Guyana]] than most other countries in the Carribbean. 

A representative main dish from Trinidad and Tobago is roti, curry chicken, pholourie, and tamarind sauce.  Crab and callaloo is generally considered a national dish of Trinidad and Tobago; it is often prepared for Sunday lunch. Pelau, a rice-based dish, is also a standard dish in Trinidad and Tobago. Another popular dish is roti  - this is of East Indian origin and consists of curried potatoes, channa (chickpeas) and meat wrapped in dalphurie (similar to pita bread). Other local dishes include coo coo, sancoche, macaroni pie and oil down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tigers are my favourite animal and I am highly against tiger poaching. It is a cruel and discusting thing to do to a living creature. How would you like it? G-d made humans to rule over the animals and to look after them. So why are we missusing our responsibility? Tigers are camouflaged, fast and excellent predators. The reason for the decline in the number of tigers is the greatest predator in the world: Man. If we keep killing tigers for our own selfish purposes then not one species of tiger will strive.Tigers like so many other animals in this world are so close to extinction. It was the human race that has brought them to where they are today, and it is only human beings who can help them.

Circuses and zoos..yet another attempt to master the great beast.  To then lock him up and stare at him as a live trophy.  To make him perform silly stunts and be humiliated so that people can laugh and be entertained.  To watch him pace back and forth on a floor of concrete, and stare through iron bars.  All so we can be amazed that such a creature is truly captured.  How strong we must be to do this!  How glorious of a species we must be to have taken away his freedom and to have humiliated the very defnition of grace and power.  Therefore we see ourselves as beautiful and powerful, when all we really are is cowards and theives.  

Soon, because we hold all the power, we begin to destroy even ourselves because there is nothing left and it is in the heart of every creature to gain the control.  The glorious thing about nature is that it does not allow one to remain in that position forever, it allows one species to recede so that another can prosper and then the circle completes when the one who receded can now prosper again.  And so it goes, the cycles that must be so.  Humans have damaged it, ruined it, abused it and misunderstood it.   
 
So as you can see, I am highly against tiger poaching and the displaying of tigers in zoos and circuses. However, I am more concerned about the displaying of tigers in circuses than that in zoos, as zoos are there to save the few tigers that are left in the world. But if there were no poachers, there would be no need for zoos of any kind, and t[[Image:Example.jpg]herefore, I end my point: Tigers should be free to roam the world just as we are.

==A Little Balance, Please==
I am human, yet I have a deep and marvelous relationship of love, trust and mutual respect with the big cats I rescue.  There is no such thing as collective guilt.  I was born in a body that is superbly equipped to carry my life force where it wants to go, and has touch and sight and hearing good enough to love whom I will love, lion, tiger or human.  It happens to be a human body, and for that I am unapologetic.  That I do not have four legs or wings is neither a judgment against me nor a source of shame.  Man's self exile from Nature comes from two sources: those who feel nature is a backdrop for man's grand exploits, and those who feel unworthy to touch the living wild.  I choose not to exile myself from nature, and for this reason I am a much more effective champion of conservation than a hundred self-flagellants who bemoan their opposable thumbs.  Forgive yourself and mankind, and go forth in love to stop the war against nature and heal the broken remnants of living Earth.  Peace be with you....

      <text xml:space="preserve">Catalan verbs can be tricky to conjugate. Many verbs are irregular, though similarities between three basic groups of verbs do exist and a few ground rules can be made.
Verb use in Catalan is similar to French and Spanish but has a few notable exceptions:
*Like Spanish, Catalan regularly uses two past tenses. 
**If the action was completed today, or the result of the action is still valid, Catalan uses the '''pretèrit indefinit'''
***''Aquest matí hem cantat—We sang this morning. Enguany he visitat les illes balears—This year I visited the Balearic Islands''
**If the action was completed before today, or the action clearly occurred only once, Catalan uses the '''pretèrit perfet'''
***''Ahir al matí vam cantar—We sang yesterday morning. L'any passat vaig visitar les illes balears—Last year I visited the Balearic Islands''
*A third past tense exists, similar to the ''passé simple'' in French, the '''pretèrit perfet simple'''. Like its French counterpart, it is only used in the more eloquent literary form of Catalan, and it is almost never used in spoken language.
***''El compositor nasqué/naixé l'any 1923—The composer was born in 1923.''
