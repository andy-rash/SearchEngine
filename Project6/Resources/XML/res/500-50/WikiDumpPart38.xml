Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pandemix. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pandemix~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Noise=
There are '''three types of noise''', which garble a communication: 
'''''semantic''''' (i.e., speech impediments or misspelling), '''environmental''' (i.e., background noise), and '''''tech''''' (i.e., static). 

There are also '''three types of filters''', which determine how a communication gets interpreted by the receiver: 

''info'' (i.e., the message is in a language unknown to the receiver), ''physical'' (i.e., the reciever is fatigued), or ''psych'' (i.e., the receiver is prejudiced in some way toward the communicator or message).

= Hypodermic Model=

'''The hypodermic needle model is a model of communications'''. It is also referred to as the &quot;magic bullet&quot;, or the &quot;profound effects&quot; theory. Essentially this model holds that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver.

The most famous example of what would be considered the result of the Magic Bullet or Hypodermic Needle Model was the 1938 broadcast of The War of the Worlds and the subsequent reaction of the mass American audience that was tuned in.

The phrasing &quot;Hypodermic needle&quot; is meant to give a mental image of a message's direct infusion into an individual. This view tends to ignore things like interpretation and for this fatal flaw it is clearly less than perfect.

A more modern version is the Two-step flow of communication theory (or &quot;minimal effects&quot; theory). The two-step flow model was propouded by Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz. Unlike the hypodermic needle model which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency. (One way of looking at it is that media doesn't tell us what to ''think'', it tells us what to ''think about''.)

According to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the &quot;masses&quot; through opinion leadership. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.

Two-step flow model laid the foundation for diffusion of innovations.

=Cultivation Theory=

Developed by Professor George Gerbner, the '''Cultivation Theory'''  focuses on the effects of long term repetition of messages. This view of media's influence on culture states that it occurs over time through a distortion of reality. Cultivation Theory does not rely on extensive consumption of media, but that the media ''cultivates'' cultural change over time throughout society. 

The effects of cultivation of the media are exacerbated by an '''homogenized''' media landscape, where media outlets, through financial or other pressures, become similar or uniform. If all people receive a similar media message, portraying uniform values, then audiences will more quickly perceive those representations to be accurate.

=Elitist and Populist Media=



Broadly speaking, there are two views of media's place in society. One is Elitist (media should educate), and the other is Populist (media should be whatever the people want).

Marshall McLuhan was a famous media and communication theorist. He coined the term &quot;global village&quot; while discussing his belief that the effect of the television would be to unite the world. He also believed that print media changes the way you think, and that the written word could make language &quot;official.&quot;

== 1. Identify at least 20 symbols used in electronics. ==

[[Image:AY_Radio_Electronics_Symbols.png]]

== 2. Identify the value of resistors by the color code ==

From Wikipedia

The value of a resistor is marked on the device itself by using bands of colors.

[[Image:Resistor_bands.png]]

band '''A''' is first significant figure of resistance value in ohms&lt;br&gt;
band '''B''' is the second significant figure&lt;br&gt;
band '''C''' is the decimal multiplier&lt;br&gt;
band '''D''' if present, indicates tolerance of value in percent (no color means 20%)

Resistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate (reliability); refer to MIL-STD-199 for further details.

The Standard EIA Color Code Table per EIA-RS-279 is as follows:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!Color!!1st band!!2nd band!!3rd band (Multiplier)!!4th band (Tolerance)!!Temp. Coefficient
|- bgcolor = &quot;#000000&quot;
|&lt;font color = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;[[Black]]&lt;/font&gt;||&lt;font color = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;0&lt;/font&gt;||&lt;font color = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;0&lt;/font&gt;||&lt;font color = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;

A useful mnemonic for remembering the first ten color codes is &quot;'''B'''etter '''B'''e '''R'''ight '''O'''r '''Y'''our '''G'''reat '''B'''ig '''V'''enture '''G'''oes '''W'''est&quot;, where the first letter matches the first letter of the color code, by order of increasing magnitude.

Resistors are measured in ohms, so ''yellow violet red brown'' means 4,700 ohms, 1% tolerance.

== 3. Demonstrate proper soldering techniques ==
Soldering is a way of semi-permanently connecting electronic components together or to a circuit board.  It involves heating the solder to its melting point and letting it re-solidify on the components themselves.  The heating is done with a soldering iron.  

Begin by turning on the soldering iron and waiting until it is hot enough to melt solder.  You can test this by touching some solder to the tip of the iron.  Clean the tip of the soldering iron by wiping it on a wet sponge.  This may be repeated often when soldering a lot of joints.

The connection should also be bright and clean before attempting to solder them.  They are often clean enough and require no attention, but if you have difficulty getting the solder to stick, clean them with some solder flux.

Place the tip of the iron on the components you wish to connect and heat them both.  Do this while simultaneously touching the solder to the components - do not touch the solder to the iron.  The goal is to heat the components to the point where they are able to melt the solder themselves.  Otherwise you will end up with a &quot;cold&quot; solder joint which will fail sometime in the future.

If soldering wires, twist them together first.  Although solder has a small amount of mechanical strength, it is not sufficient to withstand very much stress.  Therefore, it should not be relied upon for anything other than making an electrical connection.  If the joint is stressed, it can easily fail.

And always remember - solder is HOT, as are freshly soldered electronic components. Failure to be careful may result in a nasty burn.

== 4. Explain the use and operation of various important components in electronics such as resistors, variable capacitors, fixed capacitors, coils, transistors, integrated circuits, diodes, and transformers. ==
=== Resistor ===
The function of a resistor is to limit the current in a circuit.  Resistors can also be combined into &quot;voltage divider&quot; circuits by placing them in series.

=== Fixed Capacitor ===
A fixed capacitor can be used to hold a charge.  They are often used to smooth noise out of power supply circuits by placing them in parallel with the power supply.  A capacitor cannot pass DC if it is placed in series.  This is because the impedance of a capacitor varies with the frequency, and at zero Hertz (DC), its impedance is infinite.  Large capacitors have less impendence at a given frequency than a small capacitor, and because of this, capacitors can be used in &quot;frequency selective circuits&quot; such as filters.

The value of a capacitor is measured in farads, or more commonly, in microfarads.  A microfarad is a millionth of a farad.  Large capacitors have tens or hundreds of microfarads.  Smaller capacitors are measured in picofarads (a picofarad is a millionth of a microfarad, or a trillionth of a farad).  The microfarad is often abbreviated as μF (sometimes uF) and picofarads are often abbreviated as pF.

=== Variable Capacitor ===
A variable capacitor can be used in a frequency selective circuit where the user has control over the selected frequency.  An example of this would be in a radio or television tuner.  

=== Coil ===
A coil is also known as an inductor.  The impedance through a coil is also frequency dependent, but in the opposite way as in a capacitor.  At DC, an inductor has nearly zero impedance, and the impedance increases with higher frequencies.  Inductors are often used in conjunction with capacitors in frequency selective applications.  They are also often used for filtering out noise from power supplies.  Since a power supply is supposed to provide a constant voltage (0 Hertz), an inductor can be placed in series between the supply and the load.  The inductor will absorb the higher frequencies so that the load does not see them.

Inductors are measured in henries, which is abbreviated as H.

=== Transistor ===
A transistor has two basic applications - it can be used as a switch and it can be used as an amplifier.  

There are two basic types of transistors, bipolar and field effect.

A bipolar transistor has three terminals: the base, the collector, and the emitter.  Current flowing from the base to the emitter controls the amount that can flow from the collector to the emitter.  If no current flows from the base to the emitter, no current can flow from the collector to the emitter.  This is how a bipolar transistor can be used as a switch.

There are two types of bipolar transistors: NPN and PNP.  In an NPN bipolar transistor, the current flowing from the collector to the emitter is proportional to the current flowing from the base to the emitter.  A small signal can be amplified by injecting it into the base of the transistor.  In this case, the current from the collector to the emitter is an amplified version of the current flowing from the base to the emitter.

A PNP bipolar transistor works the same way as an NPN except that the direction of current flow is reversed - that is, it flows from the emitter to the base, and from the emitter to the collector.  In the case of a PNP transistor, it helps to think about &quot;pulling&quot; current out of the base rather than &quot;injecting&quot; it into the base.

A field effect transistor is similar to a bipolar transistor.  There are two types of field effect transistors (FETs): N-channel, and P-channel.  They too have three terminals: the gate, the drain, and the source.  If a voltage is applied between the gate and the source of an N-channel FET , the resistance from the drain to the source is reduced.  If enough voltage is applied between the gate and the source, current can flow from the drain to the source unimpeded.  If no voltage is applied, no current can flow from the drain to the source.

In a P-channel FET, the voltages and currents are reversed - that is, when the gate is more negative than the source, current can flow from the source to the drain.

=== Integrated Circuit ===
An integrated circuit - or &quot;chip&quot; is a collection of transistors and resistors etched into a silicon (or other semiconducting material) chip.  Very complicated circuits can be built by combining many transistors onto a single chip.  The number of transistors that can be put on a single chip is well over a million.

=== Diode ===
A diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction, but not in the other.   This can be used in constructing an AC to DC converter, or for protecting a circuit from outside voltage sources.

=== Transformer ===
A transformer consists of one or more coils located within close proximity to one another.  When current passes through a coil, it generates a magnetic field.  When the current varies, so does the magnetic field.  When a varying magnetic field is set up near a coil, a current is induced in that coil.  By placing two coils in a common magnetic field and injecting a varying current into one (the primary), a proportional current is induced in the other (the secondary).  The ratio depends on how many turns each coil has.  If a transformer boosts the voltage, it will reduce the current, and if it reduces the voltage, it will increase the current.  Thus, the power through the transformer is preserved (other than a loss).  Electric companies transmit power by passing the electricity through step up transformers so that less current (but very high voltage) can be transmitted over long distances.  Power loss in a transmission line equals the current squared times the resistance, so reducing the current by stepping up the voltage saves a ''lot'' of energy.  The voltage is stepped down again before it is delivered to a customer.

Transformers are also used to isolate two circuits so that only AC passes between them and their DC power supplies do not interfere with one another.

== 5. Know and understand Ohm's Law. ==
If a voltage is applied across a resistor, current will flow through it.  Ohm's law describes the relationship between this current, voltage, and resistance.  It can be written as 

&lt;math&gt; V = I R &lt;/math&gt;

Where v is voltage (measured in volts), i is current (measured in amps), and r is resistance (measured in ohms).  The equation can also be written as

&lt;math&gt; I = \frac{V}{R} &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Basically, it means that if the voltage is held constant and the resistance is decreased, the current is increased.  Or if the resistance is held constant and the current is increased, the voltage will also increase.

== 6. Determine how to correctly place or pin integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, and capacitors in a circuit board. ==
=== Integrated Circuits ===
Integrated circuits usually have some means of indicating where &quot;pin 1&quot; is on the device.  Once pin 1 is located, the remaining pins are numbered going counter-clockwise around the device.  On a DIP, pin one is located to the left of a notch milled into the top of the IC as shown below:

[[Image:Pin_one_indicator.png|Pin one indicator on an 8-pin DIP ]]

=== Transistors ===
Transistors come in a variety of packages.  To determine which pin is the base, collector, and emitter (bipolar transistors) or gate, source, and drain (field effect transistors), refer to the device's data sheet.

=== Diodes ===
A diode is usually marked with a stripe near its cathode.  Current flows from the anode to the cathode, but not from the cathode to the anode.  The stripe can be interpreted to look like a gate that won't let the current enter.

=== Capacitors ===
Only polarized capacitors are &quot;pinned,&quot; and care must be taken to not plug them in backwards.  If an electrolytic capacitor is charged in reverse, it can explode.  Polarized capacitors are often marked with a stripe showing which terminal is the cathode (negative terminal).  Sometimes the stripe will connect the cathode and the anode, but it will have arrows or minus signs on the stripe indicating direction of current flow (anode to cathode).  In a schematic, the curved plate of the capacitor represents the cathode and the straight plate represents the anode.

[[Image:Polarized_capacitors.jpg|Polarized Capacitors]]



In the picture above, the cathode of the black capacitor is on the right.  The cathode of the blue capacitor is toward the bottom.

== 7. What is meant by a parallel and a series circuit? ==
A series circuit is a circuit in which the components are placed end-to-end.  A parallel circuit connects both terminals of two components together.

[[Image:Series_parallel_resistors.png|Series and Parallel Circuits]]

In a series circuit the current flowing through both devices will be equal, but the voltage across them will be different if the resistances are different.

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across the two elements will be identical, but the current divides between them.  Some current goes through the top, the rest goes through the bottom.

== 8. From a kit or from scratch make two of the following: ==
Good places in the United States to find components for the projects detailed below include Waytek, Radio Shack, Mouser, Online Components, Digikey, Kionix (sensors) and Jameco.  All of these suppliers will sell to hobbyists in small quantities.

Another option for building these is to buy a kit.  You can buy kits for individual projects or you can buy general purpose kits that will let you experiment with many different circuits.  Check with Radio Shack to see their current offerings.  Electronics kits can also be found at toy stores, especially those that emphasize &quot;learning&quot; toys.  Such suppliers include Toys R Us and Imaginarium, both of which offer kits over the Internet via Amazon.

=== Photocell Guard or Counter ===
The Photocell Guard circuit is a photo sensitive switch that will either turn on or turn off some device.  In modern terminology, it would be called a photo-sensitive switch.  A Photocell Counter is a circuit which counts the number of times a photo-sensitive switch is activated.  In modern terminology, it would be called a Photo-sensitive Counting Circuit.

[[Image:Photo_detector.png|Photo Detector]]

In this circuit, R2 is a cadmium sulfide cell (CdS cell) - that is, a light-sensitive resistor.  When exposed to light, the resistance of the cell decreases.  In darkness, the cell has a higher resistance.  R1 and R2 together form a voltage divider circuit.  As the light striking CdS cell gets brighter, the voltage at the common terminal decreases.  As it gets darker, the voltage increases.  This voltage is applied to the positive terminal of a comparator IC.  The negative terminal of the comparator is connected to the wiper of a potentiometer which forms a second voltage divider circuit.  This voltage can be adjusted by tuning the potentiometer.  When the light striking the CdS cell gets bright enough, it causes the voltage on the positive terminal to fall below the voltage on the negative terminal.  This causes the output of the comparator to go to zero volts, thus lighting the LED.  When it gets dark again, the LED will turn off.

The action of the LED can be reversed (on when dark, off when bright) by reversing the positions of R1 and R2 (the CdS cell), by swapping the positive and negative terminals of the comparator, or by connecting the LED through a resistor to ground instead of connecting it through a resistor to power.

=== Siren ===
[[Image:Siren_circuit.png|Siren Circuit]]
&lt;br&gt;
The circuit presented here looks intimidating at first glance, but as with most things, when it is broken down into smaller parts, it's a lot easier to understand.

The first thing to note is that this circuit requires a bipolar power supply - that is, a power supply that can provide both positive and negative voltages.  This is accomplished here with two batteries.  The circuit was tested with voltages ranging from ±4.5V to ±12V, so a pair of 9 volt batteries works pretty well.

Moving to the right we come to an op-amp configured as a low-frequency oscillator.  This oscillator, in conjunction with the transistor Q1 controls the frequency of a second oscillator (denoted as the &quot;Audio Frequency Oscillator&quot; in the schematic.

The frequency of the low-frequency oscillator is set by the capacitor C1, and the resistors R1, R2, and R3.  When the output of the amplifier (at pin 1) is high, C1 charges through R1.  When the voltage across C1 exceeds the threshold voltage on the positive terminal of the op-amp, the output will go low.  When this happens, C1 will then discharge though R1 and the voltage at the positive terminal will change to a negative value.  When C1's voltage drops below the threshold voltage at the positive terminal, the output switches high again, and the cycle repeats.  The threshold voltage at the positive terminal is set by the ratio of R1 and R2, as well as by the output of the amplifier:

&lt;math&gt;V_{thresh} = \frac{R1}{R1+R2} \times V_{out}&lt;/math&gt;

If the voltage at the output of the low-frequency oscillator is observed on an oscilloscope, it will be shown as a square wave, oscillating between the two battery supply voltages.  If this value were used to drive the base of Q1, the transistor would switch suddenly between full-on and full-off, and this would cause the audio oscillator's frequency to jump suddenly between two values (this makes it sound more like a cell phone ringing than a siren - try it!).  To get a siren-effect, we need a smooth frequency transition, so the base of the transistor is driven with the voltage on the capacitor C1 which is a triangle wave.

The next portion of the circuit to consider is the audio frequency oscillator.  This circuit is almost exactly the same as the low-frequency oscillator, except that the RC values have been changed so that it oscillates at a higher frequency, and the voltage divider circuit that sets the threshold voltage at the positive terminal (pin 5) is modified.  The lower half of this voltage divider includes a transistor.  As the transistor turns on, the resistance of the lower half of the voltage-divider is changed, and this will change the frequency of the audio oscillator.  Thus, the pitch of the audio will increase and decrease at a rate set by the low-frequency oscillator.

Finally, we come to the power amplifier.  This is a simple unity-follower op-amp, and its purpose is to drive the speaker and to isolate it from the audio oscillator.  If the speaker were connected directly to the output of the audio oscillator, it would change the characteristics of that section, and we would not hear the siren effect.

=== Simple voltmeter ===

There are several analog to digital converter (including the MAX136, MAX1496, and ICL7107) chips that will directly drive any of several 7-segment LED displays.  A web search of these part numbers (or search for &quot;3.5 digit LED&quot; for other devices) should turn up a data sheet, and most data sheets have &quot;typical application&quot; sections showing how these can be connected.

=== Pressure sensor ===
=== Simple DC power supply ===
[[Image:Simple dc power supply schematic.png|Schematic of a Simple DC Power Supply]]

In this DC power supply, household current (120VAC, 60Hz in North America) is applied to the power cord on the left.  The fuse protects the circuit and '''should not be omitted'''.  The voltage is then stepped down by the power transformer.  Power transformers are available at Radio Shack and at hardware stores (see the doorbell section).  Try to select a transformer that will output a voltage close to but a little higher than the desired DC output voltage.  

Once the voltage has been stepped down, it goes through a network of diodes set up as a &quot;full bridge rectifier.&quot;  The diodes direct current to the top of the network and allow it to return through the bottom, regardless of whether the input voltage is positive or negative.  

The capacitor then smooths out the voltage.  Without the capacitor, the output from the diode network would continually drop to zero, and then rise back up to its peak value.  The capacitor averages this out, giving a smoothed DC value.

The next element in the circuit is an LM7805, a 5-volt linear voltage regulator.  This can be replaced with similar devices to get different voltages (i.e., an LM7812 for 12V, an LM7809 for 9 volts, etc.).  The LM7805 will output a steady 5 Volts as long as the input voltage is sufficiently high.  The transformer should be chosen such that the voltage input to the regulator is not much higher than 5V (6V or 7V would be good).  Excess voltage is dropped across the device's input and output terminals, and is converted to heat.  The greater this voltage, the more heat the device has to dissipate.  Since it can only dissipate a finite amount of heat, this in effect limits the amount of power this circuit can provide.  Attaching a heat sink to the LM7805 will also help.

The circuit should be mounted in some sort of enclosure to protect the 120VAC input power terminals.  The power terminals themselves should be wrapped in electrical tape or in heat shrink tubing for additional protection.

=== Simple transistor radio ===
Although this
[http://www.somerset.net/arm/fm_only_one_transistor_radio.html FM Radio Project] uses only one transistor, it is ''still'' fairly complicated.  It might be better to buy a kit for this one.  Check with Radio Shack.

== 9. Draw from memory, using proper symbols, the complete wiring diagram of the devices constructed in requirement 8. ==

The easiest way to commit these diagrams to memory is by understanding them.  The photocell and power supplies are the easiest to understand, and if both are made, the power supply can be used to power the photocell circuit.  The siren and radio circuits are somewhat more complicated, but they are also more rewarding.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;It is now possible for any writer with a book to get it published at nominal cost or free, and to have it on sale at booksellers like Amazon.com.&quot;|caption=--Piers Anthony}}

All authors who publish books and articles have at least one thing in common: they believe their work is interesting, desirable, or useful to other people. Many texts, such as this Rhetoric and Composition wikitext, are published online and are available for free, without any paid authors or editors. Although many authors and readers prefer print publications, it is now entirely possible to earn a good living writing exclusively for the web. 

Getting published may seem unlikely or even impossible, but there are readily available resources to help you. If you are interested in freelance writing for magazines, the ''Writer’s Market'' is probably one of the most accessible and helpful sources (see below). If you are interested in publishing scholarly or professional research, you will need to familiarize yourself with the journals and book publishers associated with your field. 

It is very important to know a publisher's expectations before sending them a manuscript. Pay close attention to the publisher's policies; some do not accept any unsolicited manuscripts, and many have strict rules about formatting, subject matter, and deadlines. Don't waste time and money sending out manuscripts that are certain to be rejected.

If you want to send an idea for a potential article or book to an editor, you may do this in a query letter. A query letter should be short and to the point. The point is to interest the editor into buying your idea or article or at least requesting a book proposal or entire manuscript. Included in a query letter is a strong opening lead about the article, book, or piece, a description of the development or structure and content, any other information or images you intend to include, why you are qualified to write the piece, and a solid closing requesting to write or submit the piece. It would be wise to include a deadline for reply.

=Types of Publication=
The first thing you should do is figure out what type of publishing venue is appropriate for your needs.

==Do-It-Yourself Print Publishing==
Print publication is the oldest and most traditional way to earn a living as a writer and flourish as an academic. Unfortunately, printing books is an expensive process, and you may find it difficult to interest a publisher in your work. Anyone, however, can pay out of pocket to have a book published by a vanity press. The results are often quite good, with a slick and glossy production that is indistinguishable from other books. If you have a manuscript with very limited commercial appeal (such as a history of your family or hometown), or want to control the marketing of the book yourself, a vanity press may be the way to go. Costs vary depending on the size and types of illustrations used in the book.

==Academic Publishing==
Academic publishing is how scholars share their research and critically review other works. This type of publishing includes academic journals and books in the sciences and humanities. You are probably most familiar with academic journals in electronic form, since many college libraries offer access to extensive databases of journal articles in electronic form, such as JSTOR and Elsevier's Science Direct. Categories for journals range from physics and geometry to education and art, but all are written for other scholars in a particular field. Authors are rarely paid for publishing articles in academic journals--the reward comes instead in the form of increased prestige or a promotion.

==Commercial Publishing==
Commercial publishing means writing for profit and is the way the majority of professional authors earn their living. Commercial publication can include books, articles, journals, magazines, and more. If you want to become a professional author, you should research the publishers who publish in your fields of interest. Familiarize yourself with their titles and consider how your work will complement their existing selections. Visit their websites or call them to learn how they solicit manuscripts. Some will only accept manuscripts delivered to them by agents. In any case, you will need to convince the publisher that your work has commercial value and an adequate audience of potential readers. 

''Writer’s Market'' is a well-known resource for freelance writers. It offers market information, tips for getting published, advice from agents and editors, and formatting information. These services are available in the ''Writer's Market'' book and at [http://www.writersmarket.com/ WritersMarket.com]. There is an annual or monthly fee for online access.

==Electronic Publication==
Publishing your work online can take many forms, such as blogs, wikis, Adobe PDF files, e-books, and so on. There are plenty of easy ways to make your works available online for free, but earning a profit on them is a different matter. The Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad have opened up new opportunities for writers and publishers interested in selling electronic works. Also, many formerly print-based newspapers and magazines now offer websites, many with original articles published exclusively online. Search the websites for information about submitting a manuscript or query. While the pay is unlikely to match that of print publications, there are still plenty of opportunities to support yourself as a freelance author.

'''Freelance Writing'''

Writing, unfortunately, cannot always be done simply for the love of writing. Unless one has a wealthy spouse or a bursting portfolio, spending a significant amount of time writing requires that you treat it like a business. The freelance writer must be part writer, and part business-person. In fact, when considering everything involved in maintaining a living as a freelance writer, the career is similar to that of a small-buisness owner. It involves secure jobs, setting prices, and negotiating skills. 

This lifestyle may conjure up images of endless travel and world experience, but the fact is, you never get a paid vacation. Writing for publication results in jobs being canceled, payment delays, and payment shortcomings. One must be very careful in factoring the amount of money he/she will receive each month, as it can sometimes take months to get paid.

=Your Rights=
As a writer seeking publication, you should know your rights. Anything you write is automatically protected by copyright--no one else is permitted to publish it without your permission. When you find a publisher, you will likely sign a contract that transfers some or all of your copyright to the publisher. Contracts can be confusing and difficult for authors to understand; it is often worth finding an agent who can negotiate contracts with publishers to better suit your interest. Many terms of a contract can be negotiated, such as how long the publisher retains exclusive rights to publish your work, what media they can use to publish it, or even who controls the movie or television rights. 

There are also alternatives to standard copyright, such as [http://creativecommons.org/ Creative Commons] licensing. Creative Commons licenses vary in scope and coverage, but the basic idea is that anyone is allowed to copy and distribute your work without getting your permission first.

=External Links=
There are plenty of websites dedicated to supporting aspiring writers of all types. See the links below for more information.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing/ Academic publishing]. Wikipedia's entry on academic publishing has lots of information and links for scholars and researchers.

The {{tl|Guide to Unix/Clink}} template, used at [[Guide to Unix/Commands]], generates tables of links to pages about Unix commands. The basic syntax is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Guide to Unix/Clink|''command''|''section''| ''special parameters''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

All of the parameters are optional except ''command'' and the special parameter ''s'' for the synopsis. Specifying a ''section'' number is highly recommended even if special parameters are not set. '''The command and section parameters must not contain spaces.'''

You can easily generate links:
* For *BSD manual pages, set '''bsds''' to ''yes'' and provide a section number.
* For Linux questions wiki page, set '''lqwiki''' to ''yes''.
* For GNU coreutils info page, set '''coreutils''' to a certain integer from the URL.

==How it works==
The template contains a table made with HTML and CSS. The CSS includes the usual code for templates that float to the right (&quot;float: right; clear: right;&quot;). The border style must be repeated for each cell because I would need style tags or an external stylesheet to create a CSS class.

This template uses the [[Template:Guide to Unix/Conditional|&quot;conditional&quot;]] hack to hide any table rows that are not in use. Entire rows are hidden on the server side because CSS &quot;empty-cells: hide;&quot; fails to hide rows in Konqueror, though it works in Firefox.

==How to use==
This paragraph can appear on multiple [[Guide to Unix]] pages, usually above the various tables of contents. It suggests how to contribute. The paragraph provides a link for editing itself. This updates the paragraph on all pages that use it.

==How it works==
The HTML &quot;div&quot; element (between &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags) is a simple block-level element to which one can apply CSS style. In contrast, HTML &quot;span&quot; is an inline-level element. A &quot;div&quot; appears above or below other paragraphs while a &quot;span&quot; is embedded in paragraphs.

The template contains two &quot;div&quot; elements. The inner div contains the &quot;Edit this paragraph&quot; link and floats to the right. The floating actually causes the inner div to appear inside the outer div (the green box) but with the text of the outer div wrapping around it. See [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats the CSS spec on floats].

The outer div causes that paragraph to have a green background. The color #ccffcc has cc red light, ff green light, and cc blue light, which makes it almost white (#ffffff). It appears light green because it has less red and blue light than white does. Light values range from 00, 01, 02, ... fd, fe, ff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">COPY THE SOURCE OF THIS PAGE TO THE PAGE THAT YOU WILL BE USING THIS TEMPLATE ON. ANYTHING IN COMPLETE CAPITAL LETTERS IS NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NEW PART. IT IS INFORMATION FOR THE EDITOR/MAKER OF THE EXCERCISE/YOU.

Examples:
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـتـت &lt;/font&gt;      b-t-t&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـثـبـتـف&lt;/font&gt;     b-th-b-t-f&lt;br&gt;

A group of letters is shown connecting as they would in a word. Your job is to read the word from right-to-left (that is the way Arabic is written and read), and write the English transliteration letters (from left-to-right). Separate transliterated letters with dashes.

Note: Because you have not learnt about writing vowels in Arabic, the transliteration only includes constanants. For example &quot;b-t-t&quot;, this means that the word contains the constanants in the word in that order, the vowels  are not indicated yet. Because the vowels aren't indicated the pseudo-word might be pronounced ba-ta-ta, bi-ti-ti, bit-ti, bat-tu, bu-tat, bat-ta and so on.


We learnt previously that the letter&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;(baa) makes the &quot;b&quot; sound, it's name is &quot;baa&quot;. 
So&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; بتت &lt;/font&gt;b-t-t  can be spelt out (baa, taa, taa) but the pronunciation of the word is not the same as how it is spelt. Once you learn about writing vowels you will be able to read words with vowels.

==Excercise 1==
Transliterate, use the reference chart below the exercise to help.
&lt;!--EXAMPLE:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Examples:
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـتـت &lt;/font&gt; /b-t-t/&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; بـثـبـتـف&lt;/font&gt; /b-θ-b-t-f/&lt;br&gt;

Remember, [θ] is the voiceless &quot;th&quot; sound as in &quot;thing&quot;.

A group of letters is shown connecting as they would in a word. Your job is to read the word from right to left (that is the way Arabic is written and read), and write the English transliteration letters (from left to right). Separate transliterated letters with dashes.

Note: Because you have not learned about writing vowels in Arabic, the transliteration only includes consonants. For example, &quot;b-t-t&quot;: this means that the word contains the consonants in the word in that order, while the vowels are not indicated yet. Because the vowels aren't indicated the pseudo-word might be pronounced /ba-ta-ta/, /bi-ti-ti/, /bit-ti/, /bat-tu/, /bu-tat/, /bat-ta/ and so on.

We learnt previously that the letter&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; ب &lt;/font&gt;(baa) makes the &quot;b&quot; sound, its name is &quot;baa&quot;. 
So&lt;font size=&quot;+2&quot;&gt; بتت &lt;/font&gt;b-t-t can be spelt out (baa, taa, taa) but the pronunciation of the word is not the same as how it is spelt. Once you learn about writing vowels, you will be able to read words with vowels.

== Removed incorrect and bias statement ==
I removed the line &quot;However the Python binding is an afterthought so most often late versus the C++ engine when usable at all. Python bindings are very inefficient and limited.&quot;, because in Ogre's case, the bindings are actually dynamically generated, and as such, only require a minimal amount of maintenance to keep up to date. In fact, the python bindings are sometimes ahead of the official release version, and because they're dynamically generated, support nearly every one of Ogre's excellent third party modules. 

In addition, because the engine itself is C++ and python simply controls it, in my own performance tests between Ogre's C++ demos and python demos, there is about a 6-10% performance hit when using python, which seems more than reasonable given the dramatic development time differences between python and C++. Couple that with the fact that, once your game/product is nearing completion, you can go back and rewrite heavy number-crunching methods (pythons main weak spot, performance-wise) in C++, as well as JIT compliers like Psyco (psyco.sourceforge.net), and you have an incredibly efficient way to develop a game or other 3d application.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word &quot;utopia,&quot; in its most common meaning, refers to a socially or politically perfect state or nation. Alternatively, it can also be understood to mean the human efforts to create a better society, or more specifically, a perfect society that does not yet exist.

Ideas which could radically change societies or governments are may be referred to as &quot;utopian ideas,&quot; often in a negative tone. Similarly, &quot;utopia&quot; can be used in a negative way; often to discredit ideas deemed too optimistic, unrealistic, or hopeful to be practically realized in the world as it exists today.

&quot;Utopia&quot; has also been used to describe actual communities founded in an attempt to create a perfect or utopian society.

Conversely, the word &quot;dystopia,&quot; presumably a derivative of the word &quot;utopia,&quot; can be used to refer to a failed Utopia; that is, to a nightmarish civilization with laws or a social order contrary to the utopian ideal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">People do have to eat and live and find shelter. People must have their basic physiological needs met before they can go on to strive for the gratification of their higher needs. These higher needs include love, fulfilling social relationships, self-actualization, and so forth. 

Economics deals with allocating limited resources in the most advantageous ways possible. 

When you're creating a society it is important to see that the nations of today with the most successful economies are the ones that practice a free-market capitalism. Critics of capitalism point to the potential instability of a capitalist system or to the tendency of free markets to result in some members of society living in poverty or without prospects for self improvement. A separate concern that does not touch on political economics directly is the tendency of free market economies to cater to human appetites to the point of encouraging vices. While certain vices may stimulate a community's financial opportunities, they can also prove destructive to public morality in a way that conflicts with the desire for utopia.  

However if we attempt to establish this economy through a veil of ignorance which rawl's present's all people within this community would have agreed previously on the laws of the economy. When deciding which laws to enact the community should definitely vote through census. By doing hosting a census vote, and only through that can we make everybody within this community truly accept their economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important to learn from our mistakes. Extensive research should be done on previous attempts to build an utopia. 

===History of the Term===
{{sectstub}}

The word 'utopia' was coined by Thomas More in 1515 as the name of his fictional island. The name itself is a play on the Greek ou-topos, meaning &quot;no place&quot;, and eu-topos, meaning &quot;good place&quot; --an ironic joke on the likelihood of such a paradise existing. Since then 'utopian' and 'dystopian' have become literary genres of their own. Plato’s ‘Republic’ is now often referred to as a utopia as is Swifts ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ and even the biblical story of the Garden of Eden.  Famous modern attempts to understand a utopia include George Orwell’s classic 1984, Robert Heinlein's ‘Stranger in a Strange Land’ and Aldous Huxley’s ‘Brave New World.’

The term utopia has become a by-word for idealism, often used now as an ironic criticism of an overly enthusiastic plan.  Many authors have described their utopia with great practicality and attention to detail but still the term utopia has become stereotyped as reflecting ambitious notions that are too optimistic and idealistic for practical application; readers often argue their concepts are impossible, their logic refutable and thus their conclusions void.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aim of this book is to collect examples of Utopian ideologies both past and present; to examine attempts—both successful and otherwise--to implement them; and to analyze the factors at play in utopian thinking. Additionally, critiques of utopian thoughts and ideals and the way in which they relate to utopian thinking will be examined in similar depth. 

A further aim of this writing is to assist those who wish to create the &quot;perfect&quot; society. Since the beginning of time, humans have attempted, with varying levels of success, to improve their respective societies in order to make them more harmonious systems; the problem for those thinkers developing theories of the perfect society is that it is oftentimes much easier to &quot;improve&quot; an existing society than it is to build a better one from nothing—though more than a few have tried to build &quot;from scratch&quot; in ways ranging from peaceful change to violent revolution.

The reader may wish to consider the following questions while reading or contributing to this book: If you had the opportunity to build the perfect society—considering the available resources in the land in question, the level of scientific knowledge, the developmental level of computer science, and so forth—what would it be? What economic system would you choose? What political system would be implemented? What laws passed, what rights recognized, what constitution written? And are attempts to create a perfect society  ultimately doomed to failure?

      <text xml:space="preserve">New Harmony, formerly named &quot;Harmony,&quot; was built by the Harmony Society, headed by George Rapp (also known as Johann Georg Rapp). This was the second of three towns built by the German religious group, known as Rappites. When the society decided to move back to Pennsylvania, they sold the 30,000 acres (121 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land and buildings to Robert Owen, the Welsh utopian thinker and social reformer for $150,000, who then changed the name from &quot;Harmony&quot; to &quot;New Harmony.&quot; Owen recruited residents to his model community, but a number of factors led to an early breakup of the communitarian experiment.

The experiment was established in 1825 and dissolved in 1829 due to constant quarrels. The town banned money and other commodities. American individualist anarchist, Josiah Warren, who was one of the original participants in the New Harmony Society, asserted that community was doomed to failure due to a lack of individual sovereignty and private property. He says of the community: &quot;It seemed that the difference of opinion, tastes and purposes increased just in proportion to the demand for conformity. Two years were worn out in this way; at the end of which, I believe that not more than three persons had the least hope of success. Most of the experimenters left in despair of all reforms, and conservativism felt itself confirmed. We had tried every conceivable form of organization and government. We had a world in miniature. --we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result. ...It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us ...our &quot;united interests&quot; were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation... and it was evident that just in proportion to the contact of persons or interests, so are concessions and compromises indispensable.&quot; (Periodical Letter II 1856)

Underneath the pretty desktop background, candy-like graphics, and slick effects on the surface of Mac OS X is a [[UNIX]] foundation. UNIX handles all of the under-the-hood tasks of managing accounts, files, networking, performance, etc. While Apple's interface is very pretty and easy-to-learn, power users may wish to try out interacting with their Mac through UNIX's more traditional interface: the command line.

Please note that this chapter covers only the very basics of using the command line, and assumes you have no experience with command lines, programming, etc. If you want a more advanced look at UNIX, please view the [[../Advanced Concepts/]] chapter.

As with all versions of Unix, OSX consists of a kernel (as described in [[../History|history]]) and some core utils that are available through the bash shell. The kernel and the core utils are open-source, but not the additional pieces of osx such as finder and the various components that make OSX what it is. The UNIX theory consists in providing only basic functionalities (for example, the cp program can only copy files from one location to another) and so this model is fast, bug free, and secure because it's easily maintainable (taken from a Linux kernel programming book); everything is split into small parts for this reason.

==Getting to the Command Line==
To access the command line, you'll use the Terminal Utility. It's in the Applications &gt; Utilities folder.

==bash: The UNIX Finder==
*ls
*cp
*rm
*rmdir
*tar
*mkdir
*more
*ps
*ssh
*scp
*man

==compiler version==
http://www.voxgratia.org/docs/compilers.html

==Unix environment and programs==
As in all Unix systems, you can install and run UNIX software (for example X11, .KDe, etc.) on Mac OS X. There is even the Gentoo (Linux distribution) package system that runs under OSX (portage)

The Fink project ( http://fink.sourceforge.net ) maintains a collection of packages that have been ported to OSX and makes them available for download as a coherent distribution. Fink uses Debian tools like dpkg and apt-get to provide powerful binary package management. You can choose whether you want to download precompiled binary packages or build everything from source.

The only caveat is that the fink tools install their own libraries, and development tools, which if not handled carefully, can interfere with normal operation of your osx system.

==Limitations==
the file-system is not case sensitive by default, but this is configurable at install time.  Also, unlike other unix variants such as linux, command-line parameters can come only before the main arguments, instead of before or after.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why Learn Design Intent?==
Pro/Engineer [also: Solidworks &amp; Autodesk:Inventor] is a parametric modeler.  That means that features can be related to one another in a number of different ways.  These relationships govern how the model will behave when changed.  Design intent is the careful control of these relationships so that they correctly govern the intended behavior of the model.  With good design intent, models can be updated almost effortlessly.  Changes made to one aspect of a model propagate appropriately through the model, assembly, and drawing.  With poor design intent, features may update inappropriately, or fail.

Design intent builds intelligence into the model.

==Ways to control design intent==

===Part model references===
The first way to control design intent in a Pro/Engineer model is simply to select references appropriately when modeling a part.  Except for the default datum plane, every feature must reference something else.  You create a reference when you choose a sketching plane or any sketcher reference.

====Reference stable features for stability====
*Use '''datum planes''' as a baseline.  Solid features may change.  For instance, a hole referencing an edge may fail when a '''round''' or '''chamfer''' is created on that edge.  A hole referencing a '''face''' may fail when a draft is created on that face.
*When using solid features as references, choose more stable features.  That is, reference faces before edges and edges, when necessary, before vertices.  
*Create a '''base feature''' with the basic shape of a part.  Use its features 
*Use the model tree and Insert Here functionality to control feature order.  
*Features can only reference other features that occur earlier in the model tree.  Features cannot reference subsequent features.

====Model for design intent====
*When choosing references, ask how the model might change.  Should a hole stay centered on the part?  Should it remain a fixed distance from some face or edge?  Should it move with an associated feature, such as a boss?
*Consider the full range of possible changes.  Will a drastic change in a dimension make a sketch impossible to resolve, for instance by turning it inside-out?

===Parent/Child Relationships===

==New FSF Address==
It seems that the Free Software Foundation changed their address from 59 Temple Place (address given in this license) to 51 Franklin St (address given at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html and other GNU web pages). So, I think someone should update the copyright to read as this. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 15:03, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

==Make includeable==

Please add &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags around all parts of this page which are metadata (e.g. tag at the top). This will allow the page to be included in wikibooks more easily. --[[User:Alfakim|Alfakim]] 14:03, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

==Interpreting the GFDL==
If one had questions regarding the interpretation of sections of the GFDL, where would one go for &quot;official&quot; answers? -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 21:37, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

:The GNU project maintains the GFDL, so if you needed some &quot;official help&quot; about it, you could [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html ask the GNU people] about it on their website. In general, people around here have grown pretty knowledgable about it over time, so we can typically give you a good explanation if you need one. Also, because of the high-volume of images, the admins at [[Commons:Main page|Wikimedia commons]] have become experts on the subject in their own right, so you can consider asking questions there too. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:56, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

== Heading levels ==

The heading levels make in difficult to include this in printable versions, I think. Can we change it so that the sections are === rather than ==? That way each section of the GFDL won't be at the same level as a book chapter (the entire GFDL should be at the same level as a chapter, and GFDL sections should be the heading equivalent of a section within a chapter). &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 04:29, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:Use Level 1 headings in your printable versions, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
= GNU Free Documentation License =
{{:GFDL}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

:Lots of other books already do this, so we shouldnt change the headings. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 04:31, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

::Well, I did do that... but that puts &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; tags in the body of the document, which strikes me as poor form. &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 04:40, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

::Maybe we could have another protected GFDL page for print inclusions? Or can I just subst' it? &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 04:42, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

:::Funny, yesterday I copied this Page for de.wikibooks and thought about the same thing.
:::My work a round is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1|==}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which allow use to use h2-headings or simple bold with &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:::When I think about it, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1|&lt;h2&gt;}}} {{{2|&lt;/h2&gt;}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is the most flexible solution.
:::-- [[User:MichaelFrey|MichaelFrey]] 05:49, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

As Whiteknight has written above, second level heading in this text are correct. Chapter titles in print versions should be level one. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:17, 17 May 2007 (UTC)
:I disagree. Anyway, Whiteknight seems amenable to MichaelFrey's solution, and I like it too. Hopefully we can have that implemented soon. &amp;mdash;[[User:Chowbok|Chowbok]] 00:13, 18 May 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Omaha''' is a variant of [[../Hold'em|Texas Hold'em]] Poker. Omaha is considered, by some, to be the hardest game of Poker to master. Of all of the different games of Poker, Omaha is for many the hardest to learn to play and the hardest to bluff in. It is played most often at fixed limits, like Texas Hold'em and pot limit.

The play of Omaha is very similar to the play of Texas Hold'em and other Poker games, but different because you cannot use all of your cards.

==How to Play==
The dealer will deal each player four cards, starting to his left. Once all players receive their cards a round of betting occurs. Omaha is rarely played no-limit, meaning you can at any time bet any amount. It is generally a limit or pot-limit game. The betting starts to the left of the Big Blind. The Big Blind and the small blind are just left of the dealer. The small blind, who is one left of the dealer, has to put half of his &quot;blind&quot; or payment for seeing your cards into the pot before he can see his cards. It is a forced bet. The Big Blind, who is two left of the dealer, pays the entire &quot;blind&quot; before he can see his cards. This, too, is a forced bet. Once cards are dealt the player left of the Big Blind can call the blind, bet, or fold. Betting rotates around the table until it reaches the Big Blind who can call any subsequent bets, make a bet himself, or check, meaning that if nobody has bet, play will go to the flop for free.

===The Flop===
Once the first round of betting is over, here comes the flop. The top card of the deck is &quot;burnt&quot; or discarded, never to be seen or played. Then the dealer takes three cards for everyone to see. These are &quot;community&quot; cards. Community cards can be used by all players to create a five card hand along with your &quot;hole cards&quot; or the cards dealt to you by the dealer at the start of the hand. The catch for Omaha, however, is that unlike Hold 'Em, you cannot use all of your cards or just one of your cards in your hand. You must use exactly two cards from your hand and three from the board. In Hold'Em you can use one from your hand and four from the board or if your hand is particularly unworthy, all cards on the board! So, once the flop is dealt, another round of betting occurs, this time starting directly left of the dealer. The players can once again &quot;check, bet, or fold or raise&quot; to another's bet. Once this round of betting is complete, comes the turn card. 

===The turn===
Prior to the turn card another card is &quot;burnt&quot; or discarded. Then the turn card is put next to the flop. This is another community card that all players can use in making their five-card hands. Do not make the mistake of thinking you can use four of the cards on the board and one in your hand, or any other number than three on the board and two in your hand. Again, when the turn is dealt, a round of betting occurs starting left of the dealer. Once this round of betting is complete, comes the &quot;River&quot; card.

===The River===
Once the round of betting for the turn is complete one card from the top of the deck is &quot;burnt&quot; and the river card is shown on the board. This is another community card, and once again a round of betting occurs. After this round of betting is complete hands are shown and the player with the best five-card hand wins. Hand rankings are the same as hand rankings in Texas Hold'Em and other Poker games.

== Basic Strategy ==
Omaha is a dynamic game in which the strength of ones hand (and that of your opponents) may dramatically change during the hand.  It is important to realise what the nuts is and make sure you have it or close to it before investing large numbers of chips.  For example in a 5 way pot on a board with 3 to a flush, it would almost always be a mistake to call a bet relying a straight or 3 of a kind to hold up.  Similarly on a paired board it would be a mistake to invest too many chips with merely a flush or straight.  

For this reason it is important not to slow play your hands in Omaha, as you will be drawn out on with a much higher frequency than in Hold'em.  It is better to play aggressively and quickly with your best straights and flushes because if the board pairs they can become practically worthless.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PL/I==
Here is the [[:w:PL/I|Wikipedia entry]].
===Type===
PL/I is a full procedural language.
===Execution Entry Point===
The program has its entry point specified as &lt;code&gt;OPTIONS(MAIN)&lt;/code&gt;, in a procedure statement, as in:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
 tree: procedure options (main);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Column specialties===
There are no column specialities.

===General Syntax===
An assignment example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
a = b*(c-d);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this numeric assignment statement, &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is subtracted from &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, and the result multiplied by the value of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, before storing in variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
s = t || u;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this example string assignment, string &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is joined to the end of string &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, and the composite string is stored in string variable &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;.

Note: Using a compile-time option the concatenation operator &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; may be replaced by another pair of symbols, for being compatible with existing PL/I programs often &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; is used.

===Comments===
Every comment commences with the pair &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and terminates with the pair &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;. Comments may span lines.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
/*
 * this is a long comment.
 */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
Declarations are not compulsory, though most PL/I compilers provide a compiler option to force declarations, while some of the subset compilers insist that every variable be declared.

To declare &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; as an binary:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To declare &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; as an binary and give it an initial value of 0
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary initial (0);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To declare a variable as decimal,
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare D fixed decimal;
declare E fixed decimal (10,4);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first declaration is of an integer &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; stored in decimal format, while the second is of a variable E capable of storing ten digits having 4 digits after the decimal point. To initialize &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;, write:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare E fixed decimal (10,4) initial (123456.7891);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Note that values such as 0.1 are stored exactly.

To define a floating-point variable:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare f float;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
that uses single precision hardware; and double precision:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare float decimal (15);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
and extended precision:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare float decimal (18);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(typical declarations for the PC). The numbers 15 and 18 indicate the number of decimal digits that will be stored. (Although the values are actually held in binary, the decimal precisions are more convenient to recall than specifying the precisions in binary.) To specify a complex variable, simply include the word &lt;code&gt;COMPLEX&lt;/code&gt; in the declaration, thus:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
DECLARE C FLOAT DECIMAL (15) COMPLEX;
C = 5.2+8i;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The assignment includes the complex constant 5.2+8i where 5.2 is the real part and 8 is the imaginary part.

The arithmetic data attributes for base (binary or decimal), scale (fixed or float) and mode (real or complex) may appear in any order, the attribute for precision (e.g. &lt;code&gt;(15)&lt;/code&gt;) must not be the first one.

The following definitions are equivalent, except for the last one.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   number       fixed binary (15) real;
declare   number       binary fixed (15) real;
declare   number       binary fixed real (15);
declare   number       binary fixed (15);      /* because real is the default value of mode */
declare   number (15)  binary fixed real;      /* defines 15 numbers with default precision */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To declare a variable having the picture attribute:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare p picture ('9999v.999');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
describes variable &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; as having as total of 7 decimal digits, with three digits after the decimal point. The decimal point is held in storage. The letter &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; indicates the position of the actual decimal point. For Europe, the specification may include a comma:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare p picture ('9999v,999');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
To declare variable &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; as a character string:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare S character(10);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
String &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; can store exactly 10 characters.

To declare variable &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; as a character string capable of storing up to 100 characters:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare V character (100) varying;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
A simple assignment:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
V= 'abc';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
V holds the three characters &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
V = 'friendly';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
V holds the 8 characters &lt;code&gt;friendly&lt;/code&gt;.

PL/I also permits bit strings:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare b bit(10);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
permits bit strings to be stored, of length ten. The assignment statement:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
b = '1011110010'b;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
stores the bits in the given order. Such bit strings can be searched, etc., just like character strings.

Data structures, or aggregates, may be declared:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare 1 name,
          2 first_name   character (10),
          2 surname      character (15);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Arrays are declared by one of the above means, along with dimension information:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare x(10) float;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
specifies an array of ten elements, &lt;code&gt;x(1)&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;x(10)&lt;/code&gt;. The default lower bound is unity. To specify a different lower bound:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare y(0:15) float;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
declares a 16-element array &lt;code&gt;Y(0) through Y(15)&lt;/code&gt; of floating-point elements.

Multi-dimension array are declared by separating the dimensions with commas
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   M ( 2 , 4:5 )   fixed binary (15)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
defines a 2-dimensional array of 4 elements: &lt;code&gt;M (1, 4)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M (1, 5)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M (2, 4)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;M (2, 5)&lt;/code&gt;

To handle dates given as 2-digit years and as 4-digit years, possibly intermixed in the same program, the &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; attribute may be used.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare d date ('YY'); [more to come]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The keywords &lt;code&gt;DECLARE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INITIAL&lt;/code&gt; may abbreviated as &lt;code&gt;DCL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INIT&lt;/code&gt;, many attributes may abbreviated, too.

|-
|}

===Output Statements===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
put list ('Hello world!');
put skip list ('Hello world!');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first example writes &lt;code&gt;Hello world!&lt;/code&gt; on the standard output (a screen or printer or file). The words are printed after any output already on that line. The second example starts a new line (the word &lt;code&gt;SKIP&lt;/code&gt;) before printing.

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Describe how methods/functions/procedures are declared and implemented. The following example is of a complete PL/I program containing a function.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
/* A program to calculate the area of a triangle, */
/* given two sides and an included angle. */
d: procedure options (main);
        declare (b, c, angle) float;
        put list ('Today is ', date());
        put skip list ('Please type the lengths of two sides, and an angle');
        get list (b, c, angle);
        put skip list ('The two sides are', b, c, 'and the angle is', angle, 'degrees');
        put list ('Area of triangle=', area(b, c, angle));

area: procedure (b, c, angle) returns (float);
        declare (b, c, angle) float;
        return (b*c*sin(angle)/2);
end area;
end d;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The above program contains some typical input and output statements of the list-directed form.
The first &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; statement prints the date.
The second requests the reader to type three values representing the parameters of some triangle.
The third echoes the inputs as confirmation.
The last &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; statement contains a function reference, &lt;code&gt;area(b, c, angle)&lt;/code&gt;, which invokes the function. When it has been computed, the current &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; statement prints that area.
The definition of the function &lt;code&gt;AREA&lt;/code&gt; includes a &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; statement that lists the parameters required from the calling program, namely, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;angle&lt;/code&gt;. These parameters are defined in the next statement (&lt;code&gt;DECLARE&lt;/code&gt;).
The &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; statement also states the type of the result to be returned to the calling program, namely, a floating-point value. This is indicated by &lt;code&gt;RETURNS (FLOAT)&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statement contains the formula to be used in calculating the area of the triangle. It then returns control to the calling program. A &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt; statement typically includes the name of a variable, but may include an expression (as is the case here).

===Scope===
The scope of PL/I variables is confined to procedures in which they are declared. The scope extends into any procedures contained within that procedure (except of course any procedures in which a new declaration of the same name occurs).

In the event that a variable is not declared, then the scope of that variable is the whole program. Again, if a declaration (for a variable of the same name) appears in a block that is subordinate to the one(s) where the variable is (are) used, then the scope is excluded from the block containing the declaration.

PL/I has two kinds of blocks. One is the &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; block that is used for subroutines and functions. The other is the &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block (&lt;code&gt;BEGIN; ... END;&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block behaves as a &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; block, except that a &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block has no parameters nor does it have to have a label. It is entered in normal sequential execution, whereas a &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; block can be executed only by executing a &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; statement or function reference.

===Conditional Statements: IF..THEN..ELSE===
Consider the two examples of conditional statements:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
if a = b then c = d;
if a &gt; b then c = d; else c = e;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first example illustrates one optionally-executed statement &lt;code&gt;c = d;&lt;/code&gt;

The second example shows two optionally-executed statements, the first of which is executed when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and the second of which is executed if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; &lt;= &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;;

When multiple statements are to be executed conditionally, statement brackets &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; are used.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
if a &gt; b then
   do; p = q; r = s; end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Multi-branch Conditionals: SELECT===

The select-group offers a multi-branch evaluation,
it may be written in one of the 2 following syntax schemes:
# &lt;code&gt;SELECT ( var_or_expr ); WHEN ( val_1  ) unit_1; .... OTHERWISE unit_other; END;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;SELECT ;                WHEN ( expr_1 ) unit_1; .... OTHERWISE unit_other; END;&lt;/code&gt;

A select-group of scheme type 1 has the form
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT ( var_or_expr );
   WHEN ( val_1 ) unit_1;
   ....
   WHEN ( val_n ) unit_n;
   OTHERWISE      unit_other;
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var_or_expr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;val_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) may be variables or expressions.

&lt;code&gt;unit_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) and &lt;code&gt;unit_other&lt;/code&gt; may be single statements or do-groups.

The select-group is evaluated as (pseudo code):
 Evaluate var_or_expr and store it to the variable TEMP.
 For I = 1 to n:
    Evaluate val_I,
    if the result equals TEMP: Execute unit_I and leave the select-group.
 Execute unit_other.

The &lt;code&gt;OTHERWISE&lt;/code&gt; clause (which may be abbreviated &lt;code&gt;OTHER&lt;/code&gt;) is optional,
but if this clause is omitted and none of &lt;code&gt;val_I&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;TEMP&lt;/code&gt; a run time error will occur.

A &lt;code&gt;WHEN&lt;/code&gt; clause may contain more than 1 value, e.g.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT ( my_char );
   WHEN ( '0' , '2' , '4' , '6' , '8' )
      put skip list ( 'character is an even digit' );
   WHEN ( '1' , '3' , '5' , '7' , '9' )
      put skip list ( 'character is an odd digit' );
   OTHERWISE
      put skip list ( 'character is no decimal digit' );
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A select-group of scheme type 2 has the form
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT;
   WHEN ( expr_1 ) unit_1;
   ....
   WHEN ( expr_n ) unit_n;
   OTHERWISE       unit_other;
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;code&gt;expr_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) may be logical expressions or logical variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;unit_I&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; = 1..n ) and unit_other may be single statements or do-groups.

The select-group is evaluated as (pseudo code):
 For I = 1 to n:
    if expr_I is true: Execute unit_I and leave the select-group.
 Execute unit_other.

An example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
SELECT;
   WHEN ( a &gt; b ) DO; call use_as_max ( a ); put skip list ( 'max = a' ); END;
   WHEN ( b &gt; a ) DO; call use_as_max ( b ); put skip list ( 'max = b' ); END;
   OTHERWISE      ; /* clause with empty statement to avoid run time error if a = b */
END;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Looping Statements===
The basic form of looping statement is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 to 10;
   &gt;&gt;body&lt;&lt;
end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The body of the loop is executed ten times, with control variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; taking the values from 1 through 10. On loop exit, the value of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; is one increment more, namely 11. The loop extends to the next &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; statement. Variations of looping statements are:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 to n by 2;
do k = 20 to 1 by -1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Multiple iterative specifications may be used:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 to 10, 20 to 100 by 5, 120 to 200 by 20;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
in which the loop will be executed with control variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; taking the values 1 through 10, then 20, 25, 30, 35, ... 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, and 200.

A loop that is conditionally terminated uses the &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; construct:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do while (a &amp;gt; b);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Such a loop is executed zero or more times, the test being performed at the beginning of the loop.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do until (a &amp;gt; b);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The loop specified by the above statement is executed at least once, the test being performed at the end of the loop.

In the following, a &lt;code&gt;REPEAT&lt;/code&gt; is used to specify an unusual change in the value of the control variable.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do k = 1 repeat k*i until (k &gt; 1000);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this case, the control variable &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; takes on the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; becomes greater than 1000.

The &lt;code&gt;REPEAT&lt;/code&gt; form:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do next = head repeat next &gt; link until (link = null);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
may be used to traverse a linked list.

&lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; may be combined:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do while ( W ) until ( U ); ... end;
do until ( U ) while ( W ); ... end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(both examples are equivalent, i.e. the order of &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNTIL&lt;/code&gt; in the statement doesn't matter )

&lt;code&gt;DO I = ...&lt;/code&gt; may by followed by &lt;code&gt;WHILE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;REPEAT&lt;/code&gt; or both of them:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do I = 1 to 5 while ( W ); ... end;
do I = 1 to 5 until ( U ); ... end;
do I = 1 to 5 while ( W ) until ( U ); ... end;
do I = 1 to 5 until ( U ) while ( W ); ... end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(the last two examples are equivalent)

Order of evaluation:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do I = 3 to 9 by 2 while ( W ) until ( U );
   ... some_statements ...
end;
put skip list ( 'I am ready' );
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is evaluated as:
# &lt;code&gt;let I be 3&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;if I &gt; 9 then go to [7]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;if W = false then go to [7]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;   ... some_statements ...&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;if U = true then go to [7]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;let I be I + 2 and go to [2]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;put skip list ( 'I am ready' );&lt;/code&gt;

One more example: The following statement specifies that the do-group has to be executed eight times, with the value of I equal to 1, 3, 5, 9, 18, 36, 9, 18.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
do I = 1 to 5 by 2,                      /* 1  3  5 */
       9 repeat 2 * I until ( I &gt; 20 ),  /* 9 18 36 */
       9 repeat 2 * I while ( I &lt; 21 );  /* 9 18    */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Boolean Values ===
In PL/I &lt;code&gt;bit (1)&lt;/code&gt; strings represents single boolean values:
* &lt;code&gt;'1'B&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'0'B&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Bit (1)&lt;/code&gt; strings may be used as boolean expressions in conditional and loop statements.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   my_bit   bit (1);
   my_bit = ( 1 &lt; 2 );   /* now my_bit has the value '1'B */
   my_bit = ( 2 &lt; 1 );   /* now my_bit has the value '0'B */
   .....
   if my_bit then
      put skip list ( 'value of my_bit is true' );
   else
      put skip list ( 'value of my_bit is false' );
   do while ( my_bit );
      .....
   end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Boolean operators may be used for calculating new values:
* The prefix operator &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; is used as logical &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;.
* The  infix operator &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; is used as logical &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;.
* The  infix operator &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is used as logical &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare   bit_a    bit (1);
declare   bit_b    bit (1);
declare   result   bit (1);
   result = ¬ bit_a;           /* result = '1'B if and only if bit_a is '0'B */
   result =   bit_a &amp; bit_b;   /* result = '1'B if and only if both bit_a and bit_b are '1'B */
   result =   bit_a | bit_b;   /* result = '0'B if and only if both bit_a and bit_b are '0'B */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Note: Using compile-time options &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; operator and &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; operator may be replaced by other symbols, for being compatible with existing PL/I programs often &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; is used as &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; is used as &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;.

===Error Handling/Recovery===
PL/I provides error detection and error handling.
Errors that are detected include
* floating-point overflow and underflow;
* fixed-point overflow;
* division by zero;
* subscript bound error;
* substring violation;
* string truncation.
* general errors.

The user can permit the system to report the error and perform a default action, or the user can specify a computational action to be executed when a given error is detected.

Events (including errors) are termed ''conditions''.

For a condition to be detected, it must first be enabled. If the condition is enabled, and the corresponding condition occurs, the corresponding &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit (if supplied by the user) is executed.

Consider the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
on overflow snap go to restart;
a = b * c;
...
restart:
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In the event that the product &lt;code&gt;b*c&lt;/code&gt; exceeds the maximum value permitted, the &lt;code&gt;OVERFLOW&lt;/code&gt; condition is raised, and the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit for &lt;code&gt;OVERFLOW&lt;/code&gt; is executed. The &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit here is one of the simplest (&lt;code&gt;go to&lt;/code&gt;), and merely transfers control to the statement labelled &lt;code&gt;RESTART&lt;/code&gt; (where, perhaps, the program deals with the next set of values).

The keyword &lt;code&gt;SNAP&lt;/code&gt; causes the running program to print an error message, along with the statement number where the error occurred.

A more general example follows:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
(SUBSCRIPTRANGE):
a: procedure;
 declare x(10) float;
 declare (i, k) fixed binary;

 ON SUBSCRIPTRANGE SNAP BEGIN; PUT DATA (K); STOP; END;
 get list (k);
 do i = 1 to k;
    x(i) = 0;
 end;
end a;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In this example, the error detection and handling parts are shown in upper case.
Subscript checking is enabled by the condition prefix &lt;code&gt;SUBSCRIPTRANGE&lt;/code&gt; (parenthesised before the &lt;code&gt;PROCEDURE&lt;/code&gt; statement).
Before any statements are executed, the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; statement must be executed, which establishes the action to be carried out in the event of a subscript error.
The next statement executed is the input statement &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;, which reads in a value, say 12.
The loop is entered, and initializes ten values of x. On attempting to initialize &lt;code&gt;x(11)&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;SUBSCRIPTRANGE&lt;/code&gt; condition is raised, and causes the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; unit &lt;code&gt;BEGIN; PUT DATA (K); STOP; END;&lt;/code&gt; to be executed. &lt;code&gt;SNAP&lt;/code&gt; causes an error message to be printed along with the statement number, and then statements within the &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; block are executed, namely the &lt;code&gt;PUT DATA&lt;/code&gt; statement, which prints &lt;code&gt;K = 11&lt;/code&gt;. The program then &lt;code&gt;STOP&lt;/code&gt;s. Some specific conditions are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| OVERFLOW
| exponent overflow
|-
| UNDERFLOW
| exponent underflow
|-
|FIXEDOVERFLOW
| fixed-point overflow
|-
| SIZE
| fixed-point overflow
|-
| ZERODIVIDE
| division by zero
|-
| SUBSCRIPTRANGE
| subscript bound error
|-
| STRINGRANGE
| substring error
|-
| STRINGSIZE
| truncation of a string
|-
| ENDFILE
| end of file
|-
| ENDPAGE
| end of page
|-
| ATTENTION
| request from keyboard
|-
|}

Some conditions are provided to handle everyday events, for example, end of file and end of page. For example, to print a page number on the top of each page:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
ON ENDPAGE PUT PAGE LIST('Page', Page_no);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To detect the end of the input file &lt;code&gt;IN&lt;/code&gt;, and to transfer to a named statement:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
ON ENDFILE(IN) go to next;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The programmer can invent his own conditions, and can signal them.

The &lt;code&gt;SIGNAL&lt;/code&gt; statement is provided to test a given &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt;-unit (error-handler) during program testing. For example, &lt;code&gt;SIGNAL ZERODIVIDE;&lt;/code&gt;
To raise a user-defined condition called &lt;code&gt;RANGE&lt;/code&gt;, the statement &lt;code&gt;SIGNAL CONDITION(RANGE);&lt;/code&gt; would be used.

===Containers===
&lt;List containers or references to lists of containers available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate containers if they are not native to the language.&gt;

===Algorithms===
*[http://www.users.bigpond.com/robin_v/resource.htm Sort algorithms and an XML parser is provided by IBM for its compilers.]

===Garbage collection===
Any garbage collection is automatic.
All variables with the automatic attribute or allocated with the &lt;code&gt;automatic&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;code&gt;builtin&lt;/code&gt; are removed from storage at the end of the block where they are declared. All allocated storage (&lt;code&gt;ALLOC&lt;/code&gt; statement or &lt;code&gt;alloc builtin&lt;/code&gt;) is removed from storage at the end of the program.

===Physical Structure===
The libraries of the standard functions are all automatically provided; it is unnecessary to do anything to obtain access to them, such as to specify directories or to use &lt;code&gt;INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; statements or the like.

===Tips===
*Source programs may be written in upper or lower case. There is no difference between the cases, except within strings.
*Varying strings (declared with the attribute &lt;code&gt;VARYING&lt;/code&gt;) are similar to C's char.

For an exact equivalant, in ''Enterprise PL/I for z/OS'' you may use the attribute &lt;code&gt;VARYINGZ&lt;/code&gt;, in which strings are zero-terminated.

Without the attribute &lt;code&gt;VARYING&lt;/code&gt;, strings are of fixed length. Such strings always store the specified number of characters. Thus,
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
DECLARE S CHARACTER(8);
S = 'abc';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
stores eight characters, namely, &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; followed by five blanks, whereas
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare V character(8) varying;
V = 'abc';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
requires a storage of 10 bytes: 2 bytes for the actual length of V and 8 bytes for the characters. This latter feature makes possible the assignment
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
V = V || 'dog';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
which appends the word dog to what is already stored in V (up to a maximum of 8 characters in this example, of course).

 Content of V after &lt;b&gt;V = 'abc';&lt;/b&gt;:
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 |   3   | a | b | c | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |   /* &quot;?&quot; means: value is undefined */
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8     /* index of character */

 Content of V after &lt;b&gt;V = V || 'dog';&lt;/b&gt;:
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 |   6   | a | b | c | d | o | g | ? | ? |   /* &quot;?&quot; means: value is undefined */
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
           1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8     /* index of character */

*
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is equivalent to C's &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary (31);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is equivalent to C's &lt;code&gt;long int&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare i fixed binary (63);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is equivalent to C's &lt;code&gt;long long int&lt;/code&gt;.

*Decimal arithmetic, because it is fixed-point, needs some care.

The built-in functions &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUBTRACT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MULTIPLY&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; are provided to enable the programmer to specify the precision of each result. Thus they help to avoid overflow. For decimal fixed-point division, it is strongly recommended that the &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; function be used. Thus, to divide &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; has precision &lt;code&gt;(10,5)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; has precision &lt;code&gt;(6)&lt;/code&gt;, the recommended form is:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
declare A fixed decimal (10,5), B fixed decimal(6), C fixed decimal (10,5);
A = 12345.67891; b = 98765;
C = divide(A, B, 10, 5);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In the &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; reference, the arguments 10 and 5 direct that the result A/B has a total of ten digits, with 5 digits after the decimal point, respectively. This value is then stored in C. IBM PL/I permits up to 31 decimal digits for fixed-point working.

*When running PL/I programs, use the condition prefixes &lt;code&gt;SIZE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STRINGRANGE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STRINGSIZE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SUBSCRIPTRANGE&lt;/code&gt;, on the initial procedure statement thus:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;pli&quot;&gt;
(SIZE, STRINGRANGE, STRINGSIZE, SUBSCRIPTRANGE):
trial: procedure options (main);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This enables checking for fixed-point overflow, and range-checking and truncation for strings and for subscripts.

*The lower bound of arrays is unity by default, not zero.

*Division of integers (whether decimal or binary or mixed) may produce a fixed-point result having a scale factor. Thus, 9/2 produces 4.5000000, unlike Fortran which produces the integer 4. Should an integer result be required, &lt;code&gt;TRUNC&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE&lt;/code&gt; may be used, thus: &lt;code&gt;TRUNC(9/2)&lt;/code&gt; or - more generally - &lt;code&gt;DIVIDE(J, K, 31)&lt;/code&gt;, the latter giving 31 bits of precision for a binary integer result. Alternatively, declaring binary integer variables to have maximum precision (typically 31 bits) will ensure that the result of dividing two such integer variables will give an integer result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This is a very small program that demonstrates that useful programs do not need to be large.  While toying with the idea of automated download and build of source included in Wikibooks I needed to test some [[../Regular Expressions|Regular Expressions]].  I searched the Web for ready made tools but found nothing that really fitted what I wanted to do.  Eric Gunnerson's C# tool is very good but relies on the .NET libraries which seems an unnecessarily large overhead for such a small program.  So I built my own in about fifteen minutes.  Here it is, it has the bare minimum of error checking, the controls are not neatly arranged and the form is not resizeable, or rather it is but the controls don't.  It has a lot of limitations and definitely needs improvement, see [[#Exercises|Exercises]].

==frmRegExpTester.frm==
This form is the only module in the program.  All the difficult work is done by the VBScript Regular Expression Library.  See  [[../Regular Expressions|Regular Expressions]].

The control layout on the form is just what first came to mind.  It definitely needs improvement in several areas: resizeability, tab order, etc.

There is a control for each of the properties and methods of the RegExp class so you can exercise all of the capabilities of it.  each of the controls reacts to the ''Changed'' ''Click'' events by setting properties as appropriate and calling both the ''Test'' and ''Execute'' methods.

The RegExp instance is available to all the code in this module although this is not strictly necessary because we could create a new one each time.
  
  Private moRe As RegExp
  
Each of the ''Boolean'' properties is represented by a ''CheckBox'' control.  The click event for each one simply sets the appropriate property value and calls the ''Execute'' method via the ''xExecute'' local subroutine.

  Private Sub chkGlobal_Click()
    moRe.Global = chkGlobal = vbChecked
    xExecute
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub chkIgnoreCase_Click()
    moRe.IgnoreCase = chkIgnoreCase = vbChecked
    xExecute    
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub chkMultiLine_Click()
    moRe.MultiLine = chkMultiLine = vbChecked
    xExecute  
  End Sub
  
When the form is created the ''Initialize'' event handler is called.  This creates the RegExp instance and sets the properties to correspond to the values of the controls.

  Private Sub Form_Initialize()
    Set moRe = New RegExp
    With moRe
      .Global = chkGlobal = vbChecked
      .IgnoreCase = chkIgnoreCase = vbChecked
      .MultiLine = chkMultiLine = vbChecked
      .Pattern = txtPattern
    End With  
  End Sub

When the user changes either the ''regular expression'' or the source text the output is updated by calling ''xExecute''

  Private Sub txtPattern_Change()
    xExecute
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub txtSource_Change()
    xExecute
  End Sub

This is the heart of the program.  All it does is to call the ''Execute'' method and then construct a string to represent the result.  If the ''pattern'' is invalid then the ''Execute'' method will raise an error.  this is trapped and the error description used instead of the result.  The result object is declared as ''Object'' because the return type can be either ''Match' or ''MatchCollection'' depending on whether there is only one match or more than one.  The results are shown in the ''txtExecuteResult'' and ''txtTestresult'' text boxes.  

  Private Sub xExecute()  
    moRe.Pattern = txtPattern
    Dim o As Object
    On Error Resume Next
    Set o = moRe.Execute(txtSource)
    If Err Then
      txtExecuteresult = Err.Number &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; Err.Description
    Else
      On Error GoTo 0
      If TypeOf o Is Match Then
        txtExecuteresult = xMatchToString(o)
      ElseIf TypeOf o Is MatchCollection Then
        txtExecuteresult = xMatchCollectionToString(o)
      End If
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
      
    On Error Resume Next
    txtTestresult = moRe.Test(txtSource)
    If Err Then
      txtTestresult = Err.Number &amp; &quot;, &quot; &amp; Err.Description
    End If
    On Error GoTo 0
  End Sub

The whole purpose of the program is to show the user what the result of matching the regular expression to a text string will be.  To do this we simply create a string that represents a ''Match'' or MatchCollection'' object.
  
  Private Function xMatchCollectionToString(ByRef roMatchCollection As MatchCollection) As String
    
    Dim lX As Long
    With roMatchCollection
      xMatchCollectionToString = &quot;.Count:&quot; &amp; .Count &amp; vbCrLf
      For lX = 0 To .Count - 1
        xMatchCollectionToString = xMatchCollectionToString _
                                 &amp; &quot;Item &quot; &amp; lX &amp; vbCrLf _
                                 &amp; xMatchToString(.Item(lX))
      Next lX
    End With
    
  End Function
  
  
  Private Function xMatchToString(ByRef roMatch As Match) As String
    
    With roMatch
      xMatchToString = &quot;.FirstIndex:&quot; &amp; .FirstIndex &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; &quot;    .Length:&quot; &amp; .Length &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; &quot;     .Value:&quot; &amp; .Value &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; &quot;.SubMatches:&quot; &amp; vbCrLf _
                     &amp; xSubMatchesToString(.SubMatches) &amp; vbCrLf
      
    End With
    
  End Function
  
  
  Private Function xSubMatchesToString(ByRef roSubMatches As SubMatches) As String
    
    Dim lX As Long
    With roSubMatches
      xSubMatchesToString = &quot;.Count:&quot; &amp; .Count &amp; vbCrLf
      For lX = 0 To .Count - 1
        xSubMatchesToString = xSubMatchesToString _
                            &amp; &quot;Item &quot; &amp; lX &amp; vbCrLf _
                            &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; .Item(lX) &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
      Next lX
    End With

[[Image:OpenOffice.org Writer.png|thumb|OOo Writer]]OpenOffice.org's Writer is a very useful word processor.  Writer's native file format is .odt, which is an open document format (Older versions of OOo used the native format .sxw). Saving in native format is always recommended even if you're planning to save it to another Office format like Word's .doc format, because this ensures that no formatting would be lost because of .doc's inability to save certain formatting elements. (more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument Open Document Format])

== Tutorials ==

=== Your First Document ===

Open OpenOffice Writer. In Windows you can do this from the taskbar (if you set up quickstarter during install) or its program group. To open from the quickstarter right-click on the icon and select &quot;Writer&quot;. In Linux you can usually open it from the OpenOffice Writer Icon on the taskbar or dock, from its entry in your &quot;start&quot; menu, or with the shell command &quot;openoffice -writer &amp;&quot;.

Type &quot;Hello World&quot; and save. To save click on the disk icon or go File &gt; Save As... Save the document as hello.odt (if you are using 2.0.0 or 1.1.5) or hello.sxw (if you are using an older version). Don't worry about the extension. Just type the name you want and OpenOffice will automatically use its default extension. We will go over saving in different extensions later.

You have just completed your first document. That was easy, but OpenOffice writer has so much more to offer. Want to do more? Let's turn this document into an Adobe PDF file, a common method of distributing printed material over the internet.

=== Your First PDF ===

Open your first document, and check to make sure that you have a PDF viewer installed on your computer (you can [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html download one from Adobe] if you don't have one). You should have your document with &quot;Hello World&quot; written in it. Now go to File &gt; Export as PDF... and it should come up with the same window as before. Title it hello again, and click on &quot;Save&quot;. This will bring up the PDF Options window, and for now, all you'll need to press is &quot;Export&quot;. 
[[Image:OpenOffice.org2.2 Export to PDF.png|right|thumb|400px|Export dialog]]
The various PDF Options are:

* Range - Select either &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Pages&quot;, or (if you have highlighted certain text) &quot;Selection&quot;. This allows you to choose which pages to export as a PDF, usually all of them.

* Images - Informs OpenOffice.org how you want images compressed into PDF format. &quot;Lossless compression&quot; will be the best quality, but also the largest. &quot;JPEG compression&quot; produces lossy results, and it's according &quot;Quality&quot; option decides how 'liberally' the compression occurs. The &quot;Reduce image resolution&quot; brings the images DPI (Dots Per Inch) down, which could have an effect if the user zooms into an image, making it more pixelated.

* General - The &quot;Tagged PDF&quot; option produces a text document that is tagged, IE readable by screen readers for the disabled. To produce a properly formatted tagged PDF, you will have to use the internal stylizing of OOo, and not just concentrate on visual output. There is also &quot;Export Notes&quot;, which includes the notes on the document in the PDF while exporting. If you use transitional effects in your document, you can choose whether to leave them intact or not by checking the &quot;Use transition effects&quot; option. &quot;Submit forms in format&quot; only decides how the forms for the document will be formatted.

To learn more about PDF formatting and documentation options, look up the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF PDF Wikipedia entry].

=== Saving ===
'''saving a document for the first time'''
#Open OpenOffice writer, and the program starts.
#Click on the menu &quot;File&quot; , afterwards click on &quot;Save as&quot;
#Type a filename, in this example &quot;tree&quot;
#Hit the &quot;save&quot; button

'''checking which toolbars are enabled'''
#Click on the menu &quot;View&quot;, afterwards click on &quot;Toolbars&quot;, afterwards click on &quot;Standard&quot; (if it isn't already checked).

== Basic Formatting Options ==
If you've used Microsoft Word, or any of most other modern word processing programs, you will have no trouble with making basic formatting changes, such as in changing fonts or changing color. To change the formatting, you'll have to block the texts that you want to format, then click on the appropriate formatting buttons.

The formatting toolbar contains most of the formatting options needed for day-to-day usage. 
[[Image:OOoFormattingToolbar.png|The formatting toolbar.|frame|The formatting toolbar. If you can't find the toolbar, go to View &gt; Toolbar &gt; Formatting]]

Let's talk about things inside the formatting toolbar one by one.
''Tip: You can hover your mouse on the buttons on Open Office to know what each button do. ''

=== Style Control === 
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - SnF.png|right|frame]]
The leftmost button, is the '''Styles and Formatting''' Button. Click on it to show the Style and Formatting dialog. Next to it is a '''Style''' dropdown menu, which is basically a list of commonly used styles. Styles are basically predefined formatting,  which you can apply on a section of text. Style is also used to determine the structure of your writing. The great thing about using style is that if you change the formatting of a style, all elements in your document that previously applied that style would reflect the formatting change, saving you lots of time from changing them one by one. For now, just digest that, we'll talk more about styling in a moment, after we've finished with the toolbar.

=== Font Controls ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - FontCtrl.png|right|frame]]
The next two dropdown menus are for controlling '''Font Name''' (or Font Type or Font Face) and '''Font Size''' respectively. The '''Font Name''' dropdown, controls the type of font used whether it is &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Times New Roman';&quot;&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Arial;&quot;&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New';&quot;&gt;Courier New&lt;/span&gt;, or some other fonts you might have in your computer. The '''Font Size''' dropdown, as it says, controls how &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:larger;&quot;&gt;big&lt;/span&gt; or how &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;small&lt;/span&gt; your text looks like.

=== Standard Formatting Options (BIU) ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - BIU.png|right|frame]]
The next three buttons might be familiar. They are the friendly '''Bold''', ''Italic'', and &lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; buttons. If you've gotten more comfortable with OpenOffice, you can also use the shortcuts '''Ctrl+B''', ''Ctrl+I'', and &lt;u&gt;Ctrl+U&lt;/u&gt; for '''Bold''', ''Italic'', and &lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; respectively. You can also mix these formatting together, forming something like '''''BoldedItalic''''', &lt;u&gt;'''BoldedUnderline'''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;''ItalizedUnderline''&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;'''''BoldedItalizedUnderlined'''''&lt;/u&gt;, etc.

=== Paragraph Alignment ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - Align.png|right|frame]]
Ok, now on to the next section. The next four buttons control the text alignment. There are four types of alignment:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Align Left ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo_-_FormattingToolbar_-_AlignLeft.png|right|frame]]
&quot;Align left&quot; ensures that your paragraphs' leftmost words form a line on the left side of the paragraph. This is the most used alignment, and thus the default alignment for a new blank document. The example of align left is this paragraph. You'll see that the leftmost words make a straight line, while the rightmost words are jagged.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Centered ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - AlignCenter.png|right|frame]]
A centered paragraph ensures that your paragraph would appear in the center. This is usually used for titles. You'll see that the length of the leftmost word to the left margin is equal to the length of the rightmost word to the right margin. This paragraph is an example of centered paragraph.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Align Right ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - AlignRight.png|right|frame]]
Align right ensures that your paragraphs' rightmost words form a line on the right side of the paragraph. This is usually used for signatures. The example of align right is this paragraph. You'll see that the rightmost words make a straight line, while the leftmost words are left uncontrolled as it fits.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Justified ====
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - AlignJustify.png|right|frame]]
Justify paragraphs is a combination of align right and align left. A &quot;justified paragraph&quot; would make the leftmost and the rightmost words make a line. To achieve this the spacings between the words or the character are usually adjusted. This is usually used to write in small columns, where the use of align left would make the columns look ugly. This paragraph is the example of justified paragraph.
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Bullets and Numbering ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - BnN.png|right|frame]]
The next two buttons, the '''Bullets''' and the '''Numberings''' button are for creating lists. If you click the '''Bullets''' button, a small circle would show up on the start of the paragraph your cursor is in, or on the start of each paragraph you're blocking. The same for '''Numbering''', although a number would show up instead of circle.

Finer control for making bullets and numbering can be found on the Bullet and Numbering Toolbar that would show up whenever your cursor is in a bulleted or numbered list. Feel free to explore what each of the buttons on the toolbar do.

There are also various collections of Bullets and Numbering style in '''Format &gt; Bullets and Numbering'''. Here, you can change the bullets and numbering into Roman Number, for example, or into alphabetical instead of plain number, or even a mix of them. You could even control more in depth by changing the settings on the Position Tab and/or Options Tab.

=== Indentation ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - Indent.png|right|frame]]
:The next two button controls the '''Indentation''', the first button move the indent to the left, while the second button would move it to the right. Indenting a paragraph would make your paragraph written  deeper into the paragraph or nearer to the paper's edge. You can also move the indentation marker on the ruler for finer movement. This paragraph, for example is indented.

=== Color Control ===
[[Image:OOo - FormattingToolbar - Color.png|right|frame]]
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;
The last three buttons give you full control for colors. &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;The first button would change the font color, like this red text&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: cyan;&quot;&gt;the second button would highlight the text, like this cyan highlighted text&lt;/span&gt;, and the last button would change the background color, like this yellow-background paragraph. There are big differences between highlighting and background color, when changing the background color, you must change the background of the whole paragraph, while highlighting gives you more control for only highlighting certain part of the paragraph.
&lt;/div&gt;


===Shifting Case of letters===
Say you have a sentence &quot;the quick brown fox&quot; and you wish to change it to &quot;THE QUICK BROWN FOX&quot; without retyping it, that is to shift it from lower case to upper case.
Writer provides a quick way to do this by shifting the case of a highlighted selection. Just highlight the selection of text you want to shift the case of then right click on that text and in the right click menu select &quot;case/characters&quot; and then select Upper case to make every letter in your selection capital or lower case to make it all lower case.

== The Stylist ==
If you write longer texts, however, you will quickly discover that manually assigning formatting attributes to text can be a tedious task. It's hard to keep over fifty citations or some twenty Headings in exactly the same font face, font size, character spacing and so on. Thankfully, Writer has a tool to help you keep everything clean, simple and consistent.

The Stylist is a small box that contains lots of '''predefined formatting styles''' like &quot;Default&quot; or &quot;Heading 1&quot;. Let's work on the following example and use the stylist to touch up this chapter in Writer.

=== Preparation ===
To do this, we first need to copy this text to Writer, which is very easy using the clipboard. If you did not use the clipboard yet, just do the following: '''Select the text''' of this chapter, by positioning the mouse cursor at the start of the chapter, right before the heading (&quot;The Stylist&quot;), then hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to the end of the chapter. The selected text becomes highlighted, indicating that whatever we decide to do now will influence this part of our document. Next we click on '''Edit &gt; Copy''' to place the selected text in the clipboard. To insert this text in Writer, we click in our document where we want to insert the example text, then choose '''Edit &gt; Paste'''. If everything went correctly, we will now have quite some text to work with. Now let's see what the Stylist can do for us.

=== Applying Styles ===
If you cannot see the Stylist yet, either choose '''Format &gt; Styles and Formatting''' or simply press '''F11'''. Among others categories, Writer differentiates between paragraph styles and character styles. We want to apply a paragraph style, so the default category, &quot;'''Paragraph Styles'''&quot; selected in the little toolbar at the top of the Stylist is just right.

Let's make the text a little easier to read and indent the first line of some paragraphs. To do this, we '''click somewhere in a paragraph''' that we want to apply a the new style to, then choose and '''double click''' the &quot;First line indent&quot; style. If everything worked alright, the first line of the selected paragraph is now indented.

&quot;Wait a moment!&quot;, you might say, &quot;Wouldn't it have been easier to just click on '''Format &gt; Paragraph''', then change the indentation?&quot; Yes, for one paragraph it might indeed have been easier, but what if you indented lots of paragraphs, then decide that things would look much nicer if all of your manually indented paragraphs should also be a bit separated from each other, as well as regular paragraphs? With styles, this is a breeze - we just '''change the style''' you applied to the paragraphs in question.

To change the &quot;First line indent&quot; style, '''right click it and select &quot;Modify&quot;'''. Switch to the &quot;Indents &amp; Spacing&quot; tab and change the value of the &quot;Above Paragraph&quot; spacing to something higher. Click OK and you will see that immediately all paragraphs that had the &quot;First line indent&quot; style applied are now spaced a bit apart.

But wait, there's more. Because styles help Writer see the '''logical structure''' of your document instead of just it's physical layout, it can act in a much more sensible way - a '''Heading means a lot more''' to Writer than just big, bold text. One example: If you used heading styles while laying out your text, inserting a camera-ready table of contents is a matter of four clicks: We choose '''Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Indexes and Tables...''', then just accept the defaults by clicking OK. If your Browser conserved the headings in this text while copying it over to Writer you will see a brand-new table of contents in your document that lists all the headings in your text, along with their page numbers.

Let's try something and insert a new heading. Insert a new, short line of text somewhere in your document, click somewhere on that line, then double-click the &quot;Heading 1&quot; style to make this paragraph a new heading. Now let's have a look at our table of contents. If everything worked alright... ...nothing changed. Yes, that's right. If Writer were to constantly update a table of contents at the start of your text it would be continuously shifting up and down when the length of the table of contents changes. That's why it's only updated when you explicitly say so. So let's right-click the table of contents, then choose &quot;Update Index/Table&quot;. If everything worked out alright, you will immediately get a table of contents that reflects your recent changes to the text. Easy, huh?

This concludes our short introduction to the Stylist. Go ahead, have some fun with it - there's lots of things to discover. Like outline numbering (check '''Tools &gt; Outline Numbering...'''). Or styles for whole pages. Or - well, see for yourself!


== Insert Numbered Equation ==
Type fn and then press F3.

==How to use==
The &quot;conditional&quot; template is a hack implementing a type of [[w:conditional statement]] for templates. One calls the template with a conditional tag like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;condition&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;yes result&lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;no result&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. If the condition is &quot;no&quot;, then the wiki software substitutes the conditional tag with the no result. For other conditions (such as &quot;yes&quot; or an arbitrary string different from &quot;no&quot;) the wiki software substitutes the conditional tag with the yes result.

Here are some example calls:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|yes|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|yes|''text A''|'''text B'''}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|xyzzy|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|xyzzy|''text A''|'''text B'''}}

In the above examples, the conditional tag is useless, because the condition is already known. But the conditional tag can be placed in other templates such as [[Template talk:Guide to Unix/Clink|Clink]] where the condition is not known. This makes that [[m:Help:Template names, variable names and parameters depending on a variable or parameter|the template behave differently depending on its parameter]]. In particular, if a parameter to some template is &quot;no&quot; or defaults to &quot;no&quot;, then the template can behave differently by passing that parameter in the conditional tag. The conditional tag is a hack for an feature otherwise missing.

==How it works==
The conditional template consists of a single call to [[Template:Guide to Unix/Callno|&quot;callno&quot;]], but with a hack. The hack is very similar to the hack at [[m:Template talk:ine|&quot;ine&quot; on Wikimedia Meta]].

===Parameters specified twice===
Note that &quot;callno&quot; simply calls the template named by the &quot;no&quot; parameter. Also, callno passes template arguments 1 and 2 to the other template. Think of &quot;callno&quot; as a level of [[w:indirection]].
* So &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The hack exploits the fact that a parameter can be called twice, which sets the second value.
* So &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=userpage|no=stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is not &lt;s&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{userpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/s&gt; but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

So instead of [[Template:Userpage]] we get [[Template:Stages]]. Here is the result of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=userpage|no=stages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;:
Unix
{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=userpage|no=stages}}

===Using callno to implement conditional===
It might seem that &quot;no&quot; is a strange name for a parameter. However, &quot;no&quot; is also the value to parameter 1 of &quot;conditional&quot; that makes conditional behave differently. Look at this call again:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is {{Guide to Unix/Conditional|no|''text A''|'''text B'''}}

We can use &quot;callno&quot; to have &quot;conditional&quot; to call [[Template:Guide to Unix/Echo1st|&quot;Echo1st&quot;]] and display text A in most cases, but to call [[Template:Guide to Unix/Echo2nd|&quot;echo2nd&quot;]] and display text B at a &quot;no&quot; condition. In the &quot;callno&quot; call, set parameter &quot;no&quot; to &quot;echo1st&quot;. This calls &quot;echo1st&quot; in most cases. Then set parameter &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; to &quot;Echo2nd&quot;. The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; refers to the parameter 1 of &quot;conditional&quot;, which is the condition. If the condition is &quot;no&quot;, this replaces the call to &quot;Echo1st&quot; with a call to &quot;Echo2nd&quot;. Otherwise, it sets some parameter which &quot;callno&quot; ignores (unless the parameter is 1 or 2, then it remains ignored because &quot;conditional&quot; replaces parameters by setting them after &quot;no&quot; and &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;).

==How to use==
The &quot;callno&quot; template calls the template named by the no parameter.
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=GFDL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{GFDL}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

The parameters &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; can be passed through, but others cannot.
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Guide to Unix/Callno|no=GFDL|p1|p2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{GFDL|p1|p2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

This template is part of a hack for [[Template:Guide to Unix/Conditional|&quot;conditional&quot;]].

===Errors===
If you see a red link to [[Template:Incorrect template call]] when using this template, then you forgot to set the &quot;no&quot; parameter.

How can I paint a  [[straight line]] (no-[[curve]]d) line in the [[GIMP]]?.
: I have found the answer, see: http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Straight_Line/

::Or, use you can use the SHIFT key with paint, pencil, airbrush, etc. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 23:10, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Written for 2.4 ==

How is the book written for a version of Gimp that is not even released as an unstable one?
--[[User:69.36.97.248|69.36.97.248]] 04:37, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Video of The Gimp. ==

The file [[Image:Bw photography gimp.ogg]] is a video showing how to convert to black and white with the gimp. Where can I put it? --[[User:OsvaldoGago|ogago]] 00:09, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==
A chapter on &quot;Gimp for the MS Paint user&quot; ??

I'm sure everyone knows how to use MS Paint. And switching to Gimp should start with the &quot;basics&quot;, like drawing straight lines, and so forth. --[[User:128.8.238.185|128.8.238.185]] 17:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

I know a lot about The Gimp.  Im not a professional, I have no training in PhotoShop or The Gimp, but I know how to use it after hours of playing with it.

I plan to add a few sections to the Contents page.  I would ask for opinions, but this page hasn't been updated in 5 days, so I know I won't get anywhere with that...
:Just make the additions that you want to add. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 06:44, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

== Let's include other guides ==


There are some guides for the Gimp around, and some of them are realised under a free license, like the documentation coming with the package and many more (see [http://www.gimp.org/tutorials]). What's the point of writing a new one from scratch?? we could include here all the tutorials that are GPLed; if they are not, we could try to ask the authors for the permission to put their guide here. Then we can start working on topics that those guides did not consider. What do you think about it?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 17:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

: While I would not agree with junking what is already here - a lot of people have already put a lot of work into it - if there is other content out there which would be of benefit being included, and is under the GNU FDL, then bring it in! - [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 01:16, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

== Converting to black and white ==

I just wrote [[Photoshop/Converting to black and white]] and I'm sure The GIMP can do most of this. Feel free to use that article any way you like. (I'm working on illustrations now.) [[User:Fg2|Fg2]] 06:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

== Where to start? ==
Hello, new to wikibooks. Would like to help out with the GIMP wikibook but I'm unsure if there's any todo list, a wishlist, anyone in charge, or any sort of organizational plan at all? Just wondering where I should start. Thanks [[User:Qwuery|Qwuery]] ([[User talk:Qwuery|talk]]) 22:19, 7 July 2008 (UTC)

* There's a Todo box. You could try to write new article, or as wrote there about every tool in toolbox ( like [[GIMP/Gradient|here]] ), or expand existing artricles. There's a lot to do, just no one has written anything in todo list. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] ([[User talk:Soeb|talk]]) 09:23, 8 July 2008 (UTC) &lt;sub&gt;Corrected the link [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:23, 3 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/sub&gt;

== Manual of Style ==

Shouldn't we make one? There are some general conventions, and I think those could be collected in one place. Like keys, lists, naming and such. It would make it easier for people to contribute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This shows a typical image editing window in the GIMP (this is version 1.2, more recent versions will have a set of menus at the top of the image window)
&lt;!-- Once 2.8 is out, this needs a COMPLETE rework, as this was split into Saving (only xcf) and Exporting (all others) --&gt;
Right-click, ''File, Save'' is used to save the image.  A filetype can be selected ([[w:PNG|png]], [[w:JPEG|jpeg]], etc.) from the dropdown list, but the default action is to use whatever extension was typed (specifying &quot;image.jpg&quot; causes it to save a JPEG file)

After the filename is specified, there is an additional dialog box specific to each filetype.  For example, a JPEG image will ask you for the compression level, and it can be useful to adjust this until the image is a reasonable filesize.

===Image formats Supported by GIMP===
''as of GIMP 2.2.13''

! File Format !! Extension(s) !! Description
|-
| XCF 
| .xcf/&lt;br /&gt;.xcf.gz/.gz/.xcfgz/ .xcf.bz2/.bz2/.xcfbz2/ .gbr/.gih/.pat
| GIMP's native format which will preserve all image data, including layer, the current selection, channels, transparency, paths and guides, but it doesn't save undo history. XCF images take up a lot of space, and are not supported by most image viewers, which is why XCF is only good for saving images for future editing (not for image exchange). There is also an option to compress the XCF by using either gzip (using xcf.gz/gz/xcfgz extension) or bzip2 (using xcf.bz2/bz2/xcfbz2 extension) compression. GIMP's other native formats include GIMP Brush (.gbr), GIMP Animated Brush (.gih), and GIMP Pattern (.pat).
|-
| BMP 
| .bmp/.dib
| '''B'''it'''m'''a'''p''' is an uncompressed image format, which is the internal image format for Windows and OS/2 Graphic Subsystem.

=== GIF images ===
The Unisys patent has now expired and in recent versions of the GIMP you should be able to save compressed GIF images using GIMP.

If your version will not save GIF files and it is updated, you may want to update the corresponding image libraries for GIF.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Image Operations ===
Image operations not offered in the toolbox are accessed by right-clicking on the image. Since Gimp 2.0, there is also an option to display this menu at the top of the screen. (This option is now default)

Right-click on the image to access the menus.  For example, Right-click, '''File, Save''' is used to save the image in a variety of formats - for example PNG and JPEG formats are recommended for use on Wikipedia. To decrease a JPEG's filesize, adjust the ''Quality'' slider when you save.  If doing this it may be helpful to tick the ''Show preview in Image Window'' checkbox, tthe file size will be calculated and the loss of quality can be inspected.

Often, it's useful to get info on an image you're editing. To do this, right-click on the image to bring up the menu, and then choose '''Image &gt; Image Properties''', or hit '''Alt-Enter'''. The first three properties are very important for printing: Pixel Dimensions, Print Size, and Resolution.
[[File:GIMP_info.png|thumb|400px|An Image Properties box.]]

'''Image &gt; Canvas size''' is used to adjust the size of image dimensions, but does not attempt to scale the image.  

'''Image &gt; Scale image''' is used to change the size of the image, for example to create [[w:thumbnail|thumbnail]] images.

To remove a section of image, just select it (using one of the select tools) and press Control-K (&quot;kill&quot;, same as using '''Edit &gt; Clear''').  This will either erase the selection to the background colour, or to transparency if the image supports it.

      <comment>/* Colour Modes */ filesize for indexed images, RLE BMP</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">GIMP can understand a number of different colour formats with a varying degree of support. It supports three so called ''modes'': RGB, grayscale, and indexed.

To change the mode of the image, choose in the menu from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Image &gt;  Mode &gt; ....

==Colour Modes==
GIMP supports the following color modes:

* '''True Colour (RGB):''' This has the best support in GIMP. It is made up from 3 channels of 256 tonal variants, making a total of 16.7 million colours - 256 * 256 * 256. &lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, TGA, TIFF, SGI, BMP.
* '''Grayscale:''' The grayscale mode uses one channel to display a gray image. GIMP supports grayscale well and is usable for most tools that don't specifically require colour information.&lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, TGA, TIFF, SGI.
* '''Indexed:''' In this mode, the image consist of pixels picked from a palette of up to 256 colours.&lt;p&gt;When you convert an image into this mode, or when you are reducing the color depth of an image, dithering options give you control over how colours are scattered. For the best quality results (especially with pictures that have gradual tonal variance) use ''Floyd-Steinberg'' dithering: it will give a grainy texture to the picture, but reduce visible banding between different colours. On the other hand, reduced or no dithering will result in smaller files when saved as GIF or PNG (or BMP with the ''Run-Length Encoded'' option set).&lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, GIF, BMP.
*'''Monochrome''': Two colours, often black and white. GIMP sees this as an indexed image with only 2 colours. &lt;p&gt;Supported formats: XCF, PNG, GIF, BMP.

Menu items for color modes:
* Image &gt; Mode &gt; RGB
* Image &gt; Mode &gt; Grayscale
* Image &gt; Mode &gt; Indexed

==Alpha Channel==

Regardless of the mode, images can have an optional alpha channel for transparency. An image with an alpha channel can have transparent and semitransparent pixels, the degree of transparency of each pixel ranging from 0 to 255. Using transparency enabled by alpha channel, you can create a picture by stacking several layers on top of each other, save images for the web, or create images for 3D graphics that have holes or semi-opaque areas.

Formats that fully support alpha channel: XCF, PNG, TIFF, TGA, SGI. Formats that only support alpha channel as fully opaque or fully transparent: GIF, XPM.

&lt;!-- Chelseafan528: AFAIK --&gt;Only Internet Explorer versions later than version 7 support transparency. Internet Explorer 6 and earlier do not.

Menu items for alpha channel:
* Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add Alpha Channel
* Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Remove Alpha Channel
* Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add to Selection

==Colour Filter/Tools==
''Image, Mode, Decompose'' will split a colour image into a set of greyscale images, based on various colour models. ''Image, Mode, Compose'' does the opposite, combining greyscale images into colour ones. Striking effects may be obtained by recombining channels in a different model or order than they were decomposed in.

A number of colour adjustments can be found under ''Image, Colours'', and colour effects under ''Image, Filters, Colours''

'''Okara''' is a spongy, crumbly by-product of the [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] and [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]-making process.  While it is edible, it has little nutritional value and doesn't appeal to the palates of most people.

However, it can be made both more palatable and more nutritious by fermenting into ''tempe gembus'', a form of [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]] made from okara.</text>

I love the work you've done, but I'm going to move the course and the title to 4500 or something like that.  I don't like the idea of diffrentiating between Casual and Non, as if  the other classes were really hard.  We won't be setting classes apart like that around here.

Thanks for all of your hard work and I'm glad you put yourself down in faculty!
[[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi]]


Yo- Get that negative crap out of the SLES talk page!  You've designed a good course! In fact, it's so good that it shouldn't be made to sound inferior to the rest!  I put it with the other courses because it deserves to be there!  Buck up!  :)  [[User:Atrivedi|Atrivedi, SLES]]</text>

==Proposal to use Slash Convention==
I propose renaming the pages to slash convention. (For example, [[Bourne Shell Scripting Modularization]] would become [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Modularization]].) This will generate links from the chapters up to the main page ([[Bourne Shell Scripting]]). See [[WB:NP]] for examples. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

Also, the chapter I added, [[Bourne Shell Scripting Interactive Conditionals and Loops]], I would rename to just [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Loops]]. The long name is too confusing. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

== Daily shell ==

Hello,

Great WikiBook! ;) I'd love to see a &quot;daily usage&quot; or &quot;command line&quot; chapter. There is so much to learn about interactive bash. I would, gladly, help out with content.

I'm not quite sure how to use this message feature for WIKIBOOKS, but I've found your bash book online and it is absolutely outstanding and inspiring to see your work on this.  (The above comment was not mine, I had simply added the tildes)

Reversi and Othello are strategic boardgames which involve play by two parties on an eight-by-eight square grid with pieces that have two distinct sides. Pieces typically appear coin-like, with a light and a dark face.

Mattel produces Reversi equipment under the name &quot;Othello&quot;. Anjar Co licenses the registered trademark &quot;Othello&quot; from Tsukuda Original.

The best Othello computer programs can easily defeat the best humans. As early as 1980, the program The Moor beat the reigning world champion, and in 1997, Logistello defeated the human champion Takeshi Murakami 6:0. This dominance is not seen in games like chess, where the best computers are about equal to the best humans (although the Hydra machine may soon change that), or Go, where even average human players trounce the best computers.

Human beings cannot generally win against computer intelligence in Othello because computers can look ahead much further than humans can. Analysts have estimated the number of legal positions in Othello as at most 1028, and it has a game-tree complexity of approximately 1058. Othello still remains unsolved, however - we don't know the result of the game with perfect play on both sides.

When generalizing Othello to play on an n-by-n board, the problem of determining if the first player has a winning move in a given position is PSPACE-complete.

The game pieces flip very quickly, easily and (often) repeatedly, so it offers little advantage -- and in fact typically becomes disadvantageous -- to try to gain a majority of pieces early in the game.  Corners, mobility, edge play, parity, endgame play and look-ahead form the key elements of successful Othello strategy.

===Board===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;  a b c d e f g h

Fig. 1 The board layout.

The game has 8x8 squares with the starting position shown. Each square has a name (top left corner square is a1).

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;  a b c d e f g h
1 - C B A A B C -
2 C X - - - - X C

5 A - - - - - - A
6 B - - - - - - B
7 C X - - - - X C
8 - C B A A B C -&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Fig. 2 The named squares.

There are some squares players have named:
     Corner pieces (a1,h1,a8,h8)
     X-squares (b2,g2,b7,g7)
     C-squares (a2,b1,g1,h2,h7,g8,b8,a7)
     B-squares (c1,f1,h3,h6,f8,c8,a6,a3)
     A-squares (d1,e1,h4,h5,e8,d8,a5,a4)
     Edge-pieces are piece in the outer rows or columns (a1 to h1) (a8 to h8) (a1 to a8) (h1 to h8)
     Sweet-16 are the center 16 squares (c3 to f3, c4 to f4, c5 to f5, c6 to f6)
     Black-diagonal is the diagonal a8 to h1
     White-diagonal is the diagonal a1 to h8

===Corners===

Corner positions, once played, remain immune to flipping for the rest of the game: thus a player can use a piece in a corner of the board to anchor groups of pieces (starting with the adjacent edges) permanently.  So capturing a corner often proves an effective strategy when the opportunity arises.  More generally, a piece is stable when, in all four directions, it is on a boundary, in a filled row, or next to a stable piece of the same color.

===Mobility===

An opponent playing with reasonable strategy will not so easily relinquish the corner or any other good moves.  So to achieve these good moves, you must force your opponent to play moves which relinquish those good moves.  The best way to achieve that involves reducing the number of moves available to your opponent.  If you consistently restrict the number of legal moves your opponent can make, then sooner or later they will have to make an undesirable move.  An ideal position involves having all your pieces in the center surrounded by your opponent's pieces.  In such situations you can dictate what moves your opponent can make.

When moves seem equal with respect to what moves you will leave yourself and your opponent, playing a minimum piece strategy will tend to advantage you, because minimizing your discs will tend to leave fewer discs for your opponent to flip in subsequent moves of the game.  One should not play the minimum disc strategy to an extreme, however, as this also can quickly lead to a lack of mobility.

===Edges===

While playing pieces to edges of the board may seem sound (because they cannot be flipped easily), this can often prove detrimental.  Edge-pieces can anchor flips that influence moves to all regions of the board.  Because of that, this can, sooner or later, poison later moves that you make by causing you to flip too many pieces and open up many moves for your opponent.  However sometimes playing to an edge where your opponent cannot easily respond to will leave that opponent with significantly fewer available moves.

The square immediately diagonally adjacent to the corner (called the X-square), when played in the early or middle game, typically guarantees the loss of that corner.  Playing to the edge squares adjacent to the corner can typically lead to tactical traps involving sacrificing one corner, or simply playing out the edge in a specific sequence.

In general you should avoid edge play in the early and middle game if possible, unless you can gain larger concessions in terms of mobility or a mass of unflippable pieces.

===Parity===

As play progresses, regions of the board will typically section themselves off where neither side can prevent the other from playing arbitrarily into those regions.  By simply counting out the number of squares in a region, one can ascertain whether an odd or an even number of squares exist.  In the case of an odd number of squares, by playing there first you can force your opponent to play first outside of that region.  You achieved this by simply playing into that region at any time it has an odd number of squares available, and by not playing into it when it features an even number of squares.  If you take into consideration certain squares in a region that seem very dangerous (like an X-square or an edge square that leads to an obvious trap) then you can either force your opponent to play elsewhere or to occupy one of these dangerous squares.

===Look-ahead===

As in any good strategy for [[chess]] or for [[checkers]], a player should not consider only the current situation on the board.  For each move you consider, you must consider possible responses from your opponent, then the subsequent responses you will make to those moves and so on.  The aspects of the current position may not remain relevant a few moves hence.  So when optimizing your mobility, gaining corners or anything else, you should consider how best to do this for the long term rather than just for the next move.

===Endgame===
For the endgame (the last 20 or so moves of the game) the strategies will typically change.  Special techniques such as sweeping, gaining access, and the details of move-order can have a large impact on the outcome of the game. At these late stages of the game no hard-set rules exist.  The experienced player will try to look ahead and get a feel for what will lead to the best final outcome.

Each of the two sides corresponds to one player; we will call them ''light'' and ''dark'' after the sides of Othello pieces, but &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot; would identify them equally as well, so long as each marker has sufficiently distinctive sides.

Originally, Reversi did not have a defined starting position.  Later it adopted Othello's rules, which state that the game begins with four markers placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing light-up (indicated by o in our diagrams), two pieces with the dark side up (indicated by x). The dark player makes the first move.

   ox
   xo  (one of the possible starting positions)

Dark must place a piece with the dark side up on the board, in such a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) line between the new piece and another dark piece, with one or more contiguous light pieces between them. In the above situation, dark has the following options indicated by dots:

   .
  .ox
   xo.
    .

After placing the piece, dark turns over (flips, captures) all light pieces lying on a straight line between the new piece and any anchoring dark pieces. All reversed pieces now show the dark side, and dark can use them in later moves -- unless light has reversed them back in the meantime.

If dark decided to put a piece in the topmost location (all choices are strategically equivalent at this time), one piece gets turned over, so that the board appears thus:

   x
   xx
   xo

Now light plays. This player operates under the same rules, with the roles reversed: light lays down a light piece, causing one or more dark pieces to flip. Possiblities at this time appear thus (indicated by dots):

  .x.
   xx
  .xo

Light takes the bottom left option and reverses one piece:

   x
   xx
  ooo

Players take alternate turns. If one player cannot make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. When neither player can move, the game ends. This occurs when the grid has filled up, or when one player has no more pieces on the board. The player with more pieces in the board at the end wins.

One difference between Reversi and Othello involves the supply of pieces. In Reversi each player owns 32 pieces at the start of the game.  Once a player has placed 32 pieces (including the initial 2 pieces placed on the centre squares) that player may not make any further moves.  He/she may not use any of the opponent's pieces.  In Othello all the pieces belong to both players equally; they come from a pool, from which both may draw in order to make a move.

The game derives from two different sources.

In the 19th century unknown authors in Europe invented &quot;Reversi&quot;, which the well-known German games publisher Ravensburger started producing in 1898 as one of its first titles.

The modern rule set, now universally accepted (except by those who know only the still-produced Ravensburger edition) originated in Japan as &quot;Othello&quot; in the 1970s.

Goro Hasegawa, who wrote How to win at Othello, popularised the game in Japan in 1975. It took its name from the Shakespearean play Othello, the Moor of Venice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This page is for bookshelf requests. See [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]] for why this page exists.''

==Fix computer-related bookshelves==
I, [[User:Kernigh]], am seeking a consensus on how to handle the six computer-related bookshelves. These are:
*[[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]]
*[[Wikibooks:Computer science bookshelf]] (Comp sci)
*[[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]]
*[[Wikibooks:Domain-specific languages bookshelf]]
*[[Wikibooks:Information technology bookshelf]] (IT)
*[[Wikibooks:Programming languages bookshelf]]

These are the concerns that I have:
# It seems there is some confusion over the difference between &quot;Computing&quot; and &quot;Information technology&quot;. I decided that &quot;Computing&quot; was for using software and &quot;Information technology&quot; for other topics (currently certification and hardware). Thus, after my several recent edits to Computing bookshelf, mostly to sort books, I listed two books as &quot;move to IT bookshelf&quot;, which are [[Embedded Systems: Theory, Design and Implementation]] and [[GCSE Short Course ICT]]. ''I have not moved the two books yet.''
# I think that several books at the IT bookshelf (such as [[Computer Hacking]], linked as &quot;Hacking&quot;) actually belong at Computing. None of these books are actually at the IT bookshelf, they are only at [[Template:IT bookshelf]]. I would move Hacking, [[Use the Source]] (linked as &quot;A Look at Open Source&quot;), [[Web Design]], and maybe [[Weblogs]] (is Weblogs about certification?) to Computing. I would move [[XML]] to Domain-specific languages, but there is already a book there linked as &quot;XML&quot; called [[Programming:XML]]. I would move [[Emulation]] to the Computer games bookshelf.
# I do not like that the Comp sci and IT bookshelves include books from the Programming and Domain-specific languages bookshelves. This causes a need for books to have titles and stages listed at three different places.
# [[WB:B|The bookshelf policy]] and [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] have different lists. In particular, the all-bookshelves page does not know about the computer game bookshelf, while the policy page does not know about the programming and domain-specific languages bookshelves.
# The difference between &quot;Computing&quot; and &quot;IT&quot; is arbitrary.

'''This is what I suggest doing:'''
# Move books between Computing and IT as I described above.
# Remove the languages books from both the Computing and IT bookshelves.
# Remove the list of bookshelves from [[WB:B|the policy]] and update the list at [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]].
# Clean the IT bookshelf so that anything listed on its template, that was not removed, is also listed on the bookshelf page.
# Create {{tl|computer shelves}} with a list of the six bookshelves. (I currently have a list of three near the top of [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]].) Include the template near the top of the Computing and IT bookshelves so that users going to those more generic bookshelves will find the correct bookshelf.

I think that numbers 4 and 5 are easy, but 1 and 2 may confuse users that see books disappear and 3 requires changing a policy. Thus I am seeking comments and alternate options. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:34, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

A Draft, proposing the addition of user defined, per datablock properties.

This means that any blender datatype with an ID should be able to have properties assigned to it.

'''Object/Mesh/Camera/Metaballs/Lamp/Lattice/Text/IPO/Screen/Scene/World/Wave''' - This does not include faces or verts for the moment. This may be added later but would require further work and is outside the scope of this proposal.


There are some areas I do not know enough about and request others to expand.

I encourage others who may benefit from this, to read through this page and see if there are any improvements that could be made '''(edit, give examples and discuss :) )''' - Ideasman

=== Discussion ===

----
'''Message from Ton'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
About the property system, what needs to be sorted out is;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- how it influences the UI&lt;br&gt;
- how does hierarchical work precisely? (also for UI access)&lt;br&gt;
- is there a way to default to property sets? Means;
&lt;br&gt;
you can set custom properties to be added by default for yafray, crystalspace, etc.
&lt;br&gt;
Would save a lot of hassle, and would create good accessible UIs that way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

----

- I'm busy and haven't time for all these now, - Ideasman


----

''' Reed Hedges says: '''

In response to Ton's questions above, here's what I think: In the UI, you need to add something in some pane that's exactly like the existing gamelogic properties (name, value, type {string,bool,int,float,vector,etc.}). This could be a new window type instead of the game logic window or it could be in the buttons window with the Object-level operations, or it could be part of the Outliner view.  From what I read below, it looks like the hierarchical naming is primarily a naming convention. This could be used by the UI to display as a tree, or they could just be a standard list with the &quot;hierarchies&quot; just in the name format. To me, default properties are not useful. However, they could be a separate mode of the same gui used for individual objects.

 +-CUSTOM PROPERTIES -------------------------------------+ 
 |                                                        |
 | Selected Object: ME:Suzanne01               (Defauts)  |  &lt;-- (Defaults) is a two-state toggle button
 |                                                        |      to show default props instead of sel. object
 | Name:               Type:    Value:               Del: |   
 |  [Example.Prop....] (String) [This is my stri...] (X)  |  &lt;-- Name is text field. Type is multivalue
 |  [Another.example.] (Bool  ) (true)               (X)  |      dropdown. Value depends on type.
 | (New)                                                  |  &lt;-- (New) creates a new empty property above it.
 +--------------------------------------------------------+
 

I would also request that all object types be able to have properties, including the Scene/World.
''(Yep, Scene &amp; World will since they have ID's - Ideasman42)''

===Applications===
#'''Annotations''' Comments about a mesh, object or material could be stored as a link to a text block or a string. Other metadata might also be added for different projects.
#'''Render Settings''' Extra Properties for external rendering engines, may of these could be added to the material data, and global render settings could be assigned to the Scene datablock. ''This could be a step towards better renderman intergration!''
#'''Game Engine'''  Many game engine specific settings such as Level Of Detail for objects. Different pose states for figures. could be stored in these settings.
#'''Blender CAD''' Many attributes could be added for use in the BlenderCAD project. '''(please expand)'''
#'''Simulation''' There is a gap to be filled in the simulation industry, there are a number of people already using blender in simulation, however there is no easy way to add settings for Simulation output (Namely OpenFlight Properties)
#'''Extended datas''' some internal functionalities may need to store values, while not wanting to impose the added weight to all datablocks, even those who don't need it
#* Comment: Allow users to mess with data that's accessed by internal functions as well is not a good idea. If it's useful for internals at all (I can't think of a situation where I wouldn't prefer another implementation) user data and Blender data should be separated or access restricted (read-only for Blender stuff). -- tbleicher
#* Answer to comment : it is not because you use properties mechanism that it must be user editable or even viewable. that case is useful when you need broad datas added in very few cases like a tiny percent of edges on a whole mesh
#* (by Ideasman) Guys, Id like to resolve this, feel free to disagree, but a line has to be drawn as to the functionality this project covers.
#**'''1)''' Users must be able to edit properties directly, there will be an interface for this. Blenders internal tools can manage properties also but there will be a panel just for datablock properties.&lt;br&gt;You could argue that letting the user touch them introduces possible errors in the data, but the advantages of allowing the user edit the properties far outweigh the effort of making python-scripts/blender correctly handle a variety of data.
#**'''2)'''Properties will not be assigned to edges, bezier points, faces, indervidual bones etc. This is out of the scope of this project. If there is a need for pre mesh face properties for e.g., we can address this as a separate addition. for now only data with an ID struct will have custom properties.
#'''Blender BVH Motion Capture''' Joint names could be assigned as properties so that duplicate object names would not conflict between different motion capture rigs. At the moment I am making all joint names unique because there is no good way to set the objects goint name. (Ideasman)

===Defaults===
For default settings a text file could be used in the home directory called '''.Bprops'''
&lt;br&gt;
Existing files files are '''.B.blend''' for the default new file and '''.Bfs''' for a list of default dirs in the fileselector.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The '''.Bprops''' text file would store properties that would be shown by default (without manually adding to the datablock)
&lt;br&gt;
DataBlockType:PropertyType:PropertyName=DefaultValue - Would be the following format.
&lt;pre&gt;
Object:bool:CrystalSpace.staticObject=1
Material:Text:RenderMan.Shader=&quot;&quot;
Scene:int:RenderMan.Quality=5
Lamp:bool:OpenFlight.LightString=0
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''NOTE''' from the perspective of b2cs (crystalspace exporter), not only defaults would be useful, but also minimum, maximum and possibly even a description for each property.

===Example Usage===
''Here are projects that may directly benefit from properties, appretiate input from authors and expansion on how this might benefit their project. Does this proposal furfill your needs?''
#'''Blight''' (openflight compatibility- storing openflight spesific notes)
#'''Make Human'''(make human, per mesh humen settings...)
#'''Brad'''  Blender/Radiance Exporter (material settings...)
#*material: save description as text string; save dependencies on other definitions (&quot;modifiers&quot;) 
#*mesh: use props for &quot;special&quot; export objects instead of meshobj names 
#*lamps: strore reference to luminaire data and used data source (db, fs)
#*scene: render options and post process information (filters, image conversion)
#'''CrystalSpace'''  OpenSource Game engine.
#'''RenderMan''' Adding RenderMan support to Blender.
#*shader: specify shader name and parameters for RenderMan shaders (surface, displacement...)
#*primitives: provide hints to RenderMan exporter for processing specific primitives.
#*scene: provide hints to RenderMan exporter for scene level rendering control.
''Add your project here''

===Property Structure===
Properties will be stored in a hierarchy. each datablock can any number of property folders
&lt;br&gt;(I'm proposing no root level properties to enforce better design)
&lt;br&gt;
A plugin that used properties would have a folder in the root for all its settings- This would stop it from getting messy in the UI, and keep namespace separate for each plugin.
&lt;br&gt;
Example structure. python can wrap the C data and access as a dict or as a class we may allow both to coexist ob.prop.foo or ob.prop['foo'] - Ideasman42),
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
object.prop.metadata.annotation = 'This is a building' # string
object.prop.metadata.timestamp = sys.time() # float
object.prop.crystalSpace.lod = Mathutils.Vector(0,50) # vec
object.prop.crystalSpace.shadowMap.used = True # bool
object.prop.crystalSpace.shadowMap.size = 512 # int
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

===Property Types===
Here are a list of property types that could be used by plugins.

#'''bool'''
#'''Int'''
#'''Float'''
#'''String''' ''May be limited in size, for large multiline texts a text block could be linked.''
#'''Vector''' (2D, 3D, 4D)
#'''Datablock link''' Would allow you to link to another datablock- text/object/mesh/curve etc.
#'''Arrays''' of all previous values (not a requirement, since a folder of properties could be used, could be useful)

===User Interface===
The OOps view can be extended to have a panel that would allow editing of each datablocks properties.
This could also be viewable in the outliner, however OOps view is better suited because it shows each datablock only once. and shows all datablocks at the same time.

===Python API Interface===
*Comment 1: For scripting more important than accessing and editing the whole set of properties will be the access to individual props by name/hierarchy. For BPy I'd like to have an implementation of __getitem__/__setitem__ (like in dictionaries). Examples:
**amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;][&quot;smooth&quot;] = True # set the property, bool
**var= amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;][&quot;smooth&quot;] # get the property
**amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;].keys() # get a list of sub properties.&lt;br&gt;[&quot;smooth&quot;, &quot;emit_light&quot;]
**del amesh.prop[&quot;Radiance&quot;][&quot;export&quot;][&quot;smooth&quot;]
&lt;i&gt;KeyError&lt;/i&gt; should be raised whenever a non-existent key is specified (or an existing key is converted to &quot;container&quot;). How to check this and react is the job of the script.
*Comment 2: To import/export the property set a universal way to serialize the data would be wellcome. Currently we have to use the Python standard library to store/read runtime data from the Registry/text objects/text files. A builtin way to create/parse text strings from/to Python objects could help script writers to load and save persistent data. That way the whole properties set could be stored as a string attribute of the object.
-- tbleicher

(comment: Python's pickle module provides this, though I don't know how this might interact with Blender objects, etc. -- sapir)

===Internal Implementation===
Any Blender Data with an ID would be able to have a property. (please expand and add to how this may be implemented - in Blenders DNA)

===User data already sort of exists for objects?===
Sorry, I just came upon this page searching the web trying to figure out how to add user data to objects in Blender.  Couldn't find anything in my searches, but finally figured out some stuff from the API docs.

Try these in Blender's Python interactive console:&lt;br&gt;
cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]&lt;br&gt;
cube.addProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;, 1, 'INT')&lt;br&gt;
dir(cube.getProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;))&lt;br&gt;
var = cube.getProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;).data&lt;br&gt;
cube.getProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;).setData(2)&lt;br&gt;
cube.getAllProperties()&lt;br&gt;
cube.removeProperty(&quot;myUserDataName&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting started ==

I am new to Wiki Books. I welcome advice.  I have an idea for a Wiki Book but I'm not sure it fits the policies.  It is not actually a text but a guide to resources for kids with behavioral/emotional/psychiatric problems.  I want to find out if this is OK.

== Your contributions==

Youa asked about finding one of your contributions about Costa Rica.  Did you see the &quot;my contributions&quot; link on the top of the page.  I had a look and could not find anything about you adding to costa rica.  Remember that you are given a preview before changes are saved.  Is it possible that you forgot to save your changes? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:46, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Your book ==

I am certainly no authority but starting a ''guide'' seems reasonable to me.  There is not procedure for getting something approved so you can just go ahead.  In the event there are objections there is a process to suggest deletion, and you will have time to take what you have written elsewhere. Good luck and have fun. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:48, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== How to add &quot;meta comments&quot; about templates ==

You are asking how to demonstrate the use of a template in a discussion.  Since this is a meta-meta discussion, it is going to be even harder to demonstrate, but you can use the &quot;edit&quot; feature to see how I did this, so it shouldn't be too difficult to just see what I'm doing.

There is an HTML markup tag that you can use in your writing called &quot;nowiki&quot; as in &amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;, which you can then use to do something like this:

&quot;If you wish to have this page marked for deletion, all you need to do is add the template '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|&lt;state your reason here&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' somewhere in the module that you are editing, preferably at the top of the page.&quot;

----

I hope this is useful to you on how to do discussions about templates without actually using them.  You can also look for more information at [[m:Help:Editing#Just show what I typed]] for more details and other things you can do like this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:34, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

== Internal Squabble about Wikbooks ==

I want to thank you for your comment about how you feel about Wikibooks and this change in policy.  I hope you don't mind, but I posted the comment on the Foundation-L mailing list, as I think it is very representative of the attitude here on Wikibooks by its participants.

BTW, I did get a reply (of a sort) from Jimbo, but he seems to be fanning the flames rather than trying to put out this fire.  [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-November/005168.html See this e-mail from Jimbo about the whole thing.]

I am trying.  I am active not only here on Wikibooks (giving you a perception that I'm ''in the center of power'' here) but I'm also active in other discussion forums where overall policy decisions are being made for the Wikimedia Foundation itself.  Keep in mind I'm just an ordinary editor/contributor such as yourself, but just a little more active.  I may have supporters as well, but I hope that is because I'm trying to fight for this project and I think it can be a very beneficial service to the world at large if it isn't messed up in the first place.  The only &quot;power&quot; I've been given is to be nominated and elected to become an administrator here on this project, which I've been very reluctant to use except in extreme circumstances.  I don't think Jimbo's view of vandalism and abuse are necessarily one of these extreme circumstances.

I see this whole mess also as a sign of growing pains, and in many ways a good thing.  In the beginning of this project it was largely the domain of just a few visionaries who wanted to write a few textbooks and have some fun doing something that couldn't be done on Wikipedia due to its book-like nature.  In the past few months, we have started to attract many individuals like yourself who have not been involved earlier with projects like Wikipedia, but are becoming involved with Wikibooks directly.  There has been some substantial growth in Wikibooks both in terms of content added and in terms of overall governance of what is going on here.  I welcome the whole debate over what this project should become, although it is interesting not only who is vocal about this whole issue, but also generally vocal individuals who have been noticably absent from the discussions here as well.

Please keep up your contributions you have done so far.  Generally speaking I don't see that any of them are in grave danger of being culled from this project, and in general I think Wikibooks will become a stronger project after this whole mess has been settled.  Thank you for being here on Wikibooks and helping turn this into a bright future for our children and grandchildren.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:41, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:About where the &quot;real&quot; decision power here lies.  That is a big question, and in truth the Wikimedia projects are run with a loose sort of anarchy (as you seemed to have guessed so far).  A &quot;rough&quot; heirarchy can go something like this:

:*Anonymous Contributor
:*Registered User (you are one of these)
:*Administrator (about 40 currently on Wikibooks)
:*Bureaucrat (about 3 currently on Wikibooks)
:*Steward (none specific for Wikibooks, but some that cover all english-language Wikimedia projects and can act here if necessary)
:*Developer (the group that actually runs the equipment running all of these web servers)
:*Wikimedia Foundation Board

:Of these people, Jimmy Wales is the chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation Board, mainly by virtue of the fact that he help start this whole thing in the first place and wrote the checks to pay for the equipment when everything was first starting out.  It is now an official IRS 503(c) non-profit corporation with no stockholders and a charter to help run and do fundraising for all Wikimedia projects, of which Wikibooks is a part.  The board consists of five members, two of which are directly elected by users of the Wikimedia projects.  The last election was held in June of this year.  The intention is that eventually the whole board will eventually be directly elected by the users.  The equipment and maintainence budget is now financed directly through fundraising activities, mainly through direct solicitations of the users themselves.  Some groups like Google and Yahoo are providing some server support services as well, with a few minor donations like the Beck Foundation which help set up Wikijunior.

:Becoming a Steward, Bureaucrat, or Administrator is through direct election by ordinary users, and anybody who has proven themselves generally worthy to not make a mess out of everything and has the desire to help do the job can apply to become any of these positions.  Becoming a developer is not much harder, but it does require some technical knowledge of also being able to operate the equipment and to be able to write some of the computer software that is running this whole thing.  Generally the Developers stay out of the political process and only get involved when there are technical issues or somebody doing a direct attack on the computer systems.

:Technically, Jimmy Wales can shut down the whole of Wikibooks on a whim, but that would also alienate a huge number of volunteer editor/contributors such as yourself, and have reprocussions beyond just Wikibooks itself.  A major portion of the whole debate that is going on right now within Wikibooks is to determine just how much authority are we as a group going to give Mr. Wales directly in this regard to make policy.  There is some resistance to giving him any at all.  By being the CEO and chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation, his opinion does, however, have a lot of weight regardless.

:I hope this clears up the heirarchy idea here.  Generally speaking Mr. Wales has kept a &quot;hands off&quot; policy with most Wikimedia projects and letting the general community try to decide these issues.  I don't know what has caused this current ruckus, but sometimes people try to appeal decisions directly to the top and get his input even when it isn't strictly necessary on many issues.  I also think I inadvertantly ticked him off a few days ago when he came in under an assumed name and pushed his nose into the current set of policies where I thought he may have been out of line.  He has been known to do that from time to time so he can contribute without throwing his weight around like a ton of bricks.  Honestly I think it is a good idea in general, but he needs to be careful when he is speaking from an official capacity as the CEO, as he did recently to create all of this hubub.  If he had a problem with me personally, I wish he would have also dealt with me directly than taking it out on the whole project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:46, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

==Clarifications==

&quot;I also think I inadvertantly ticked him off a few days ago when he came in under an assumed name and pushed his nose into the current set of policies where I thought he may have been out of line.&quot;  No, I have never edited Wikibooks under any assumed name.

&quot;If he had a problem with me personally, I wish he would have also dealt with me directly than taking it out on the whole project.&quot; No, I have absolutely no problem with Rob, other than his getting very upset for reasons that I don't understand -- but I place the blame for that squarely on my own shoulders, not his.

Anyway, I'm easy to reach, you can leave a message on my user talk page either here or in english wikipedia, or you can email me.  jwales at wikia.com

----
&lt;/center&gt;

Over at [[Talk:Guide to UNIX/Linux]], from February 2005 to July 2005, there was a debate between the names &quot;Linux&quot; and &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;, which describe a computer &quot;kernel&quot; or &quot;operating system&quot;. Like &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;operating system&quot; is ambiguous; like &quot;pound&quot;, &quot;Linux&quot; might refer to two different but related things. There is also a Wikipedia article, [[w:GNU/Linux naming controversy]], about that dispute.

*'''Pound is force''': Now let me bring your attention to [[w:slug (mass)]]. Applying 1 pound of force to 1 slug accelerates it at 1 foot/s/s; this is similar to how applying 1 newton of force to 1 kilogram accelerates it at 1 meter/s/s. Thus in some contexts, &quot;pound&quot; is force and &quot;slug&quot; is mass. The book ''Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 5th edition, Volume 1'' (ISBN 0-7167-0809-4) describes the pound: ''The '''pound''' was originally defined as the weight of a particular standard object at a particular location. It is now defined as 4.448222 N.''

*'''Pound is mass''': In contrast, for the purposes of commerce in the United States, the definition written into the [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/ United States Code] is '''exactly''' 0.45359237 kilograms to 1 pound. (Search the code for &quot;pound kilogram&quot; and look at &quot;15USC Sec. 205. Authorized tables&quot;.) In fact, article 1, section 8, of the [[United States Government/The Annotated Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]] gives to Congress (the federal legislature) the authority to define measurement units in the United States.

*'''One-pound policy''': For the two definitions to be consistent, the acceleration due to gravity must be 4.448222/0.45359237 m/s/s which is about 9.80663 m/s/s, or almost the same as the &quot;standard value&quot; of 9.80665 m/s/s found at [[w:Gravity]]. The two definitions are not consistent because this Wikijunior module attempts to give weights on the moon and planets where the acceleration is much different from 9.8. Thus, one possible approach is to debate whether &quot;pound&quot; refers to mass or weight and adopt a one-pound policy which requires that a pound only be mass, or only be weight, but not both. This is as if all references to &quot;Linux&quot; in the module must be changed to &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;, or all &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; to &quot;Linux&quot;. With this approach, there is one correct kind of &quot;pound&quot; and one incorrect kind.

The problem with that version of the one-pound policy is that it requires the determination that one kind of pound is incorrect. I disagree that one kind of pound is incorrect. A pound is a unit of mass sometimes and a unit of force sometimes, just as a certain operating system is Linux sometimes and GNU/Linux sometimes. Thus I support this version of the one-pound policy: '''There is only one pound, but it has two definitions.''' I have wasted five paragraphs to make a trivial assertion about a naming problem. I oppose the idea that references to pound as mass, or pound as weight, must be corrected. See [[User:Kernigh/pound]] for details. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Language Character Sets and Fonts==

A different display font can be selected via the ''Display Font'' dialog. Open it via the ''Settings &gt; Display Font...'' menu item. The font type and size can be changed from the dialog.

Note that the font selected applies only to the user interface display (i.e. the ''Editor'' and ''Match and Glossary Viewer'' windows. It has no effect on the fonts used within any formatted documents. The fonts available for selection are those which are available on your system.

In order to permit translation between two languages which employ different alphabets, select a font which contains the character sets of both alphabets. Installation of additional fonts might be necessary in certain cases.

On Mac OS X, the operating system automatically selects a combination of fonts to represent the necessary characters. In some cases it is more effective to manually select the fonts to use.

If no single font contains the needed character sets, a virtual Java font (e.g. Serif) can be selected and defined in such a way that it uses multiple real fonts. Refer to the instructions available on the OmegaT website for customization and modification in this case.

==Editing Functions==

OmegaT's editing functions are only applicable to the target text of the active segment. This is the only text that may be edited at any one time. However, text in any segment outside the active one can be marked, copied, or pasted.

The usual mouse operations, cursor keys, cursor key shortcuts, and shortcuts (select, cut, and paste) are supported. These are likely to vary between operating systems though.

''Undo'' and ''Redo'' operations are possible with ''&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;'' and ''&lt;Ctrl-Y&gt;'', respectively.

If there are fuzzy matches for the current segment it is possible to:

* insert the selected fuzzy match in the editor field with ''&lt;Ctrl-I&gt;''
* rewrite the whole field with the selected fuzzy match with ''&lt;Ctrl-R&gt;''

(refer to [[CAT-Tools/OmegaT/User_manual/Matches: Full and Fuzzy|Matches: Full and Fuzzy]] for details).

When working on a formatted file, the editor field will contain OmegaT specific tags that refer to the file's internal formatting structure.

It is not possible to add or change text formatting during translation. The formatting of the underlying structured file format, such as OpenDocument, OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, XHTML, or HTML (the only ones supported at present), is retained. Only a limited degree of control can be exercised over it (refer to [[CAT-Tools/OmegaT/User_manual/Tagged (Formatted) Files Text Editing|Tagged (Formatted) Files Text Editing]] for details).

One way to add formatting is to insert a marker in the text, where formatting is desired (using &quot;##&quot;, for instance) and then format the text in another application (e.g. OpenOffice.org) using the target documents that result from project compilation.

==What is Digital Cinema Distribution==
'''Digital Cinema Distribution''' is all about getting movies from the producers to the viewers using new digital technology instead of old celluloid technology.  It will involve watching movies projected by digital projectors (many find the term ''video'' having innapropriate connotations when discussing theatrical motion pictures) instead of from [[wikipedia:35mm film|35mm film]].

==Timescale==
The major Hollywood studios agreed a standard in mid 2005, and it is expected to become widespread during the following three-to-five years.  

==Image and Sound quality==
Images will be projected using either a 2k or 4k resoloution.  The digital picture will be free from dust and scratches, and movies originated digitally at high enough resolution (current examples being the [[wikipedia:Star Wars prequels|Star Wars prequels]] and 3D animations such as those made by [[wikipedia:Pixar|Pixar]]) will show no grain. 

Sound will change little from the digital surround found across the developed world, except that it will not be prone to the drop-out and pops common at reel changes.

==Business Implications==
Currently a large amount of the cost involved in getting a film to the cinema is the production and shipping of 35mm film prints.  This cost, along with the cost of promotion and marketing, is borne by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_distributor Distributor], and is known as the Prints and Advertising cost (P&amp;A).  With digital distribution all that is moved is a multi-gigabyte file (provided by the producer) containing picture and sound, so costs are dramatically reduced.  This cost reduction is the main reason the change will occur, since most cinema-goers seem satisfied with the current technology.

Furthermore, digital technology has been shown to consistently reduce in cost over a relatively short time compared with mechanical technology (i.e. celluloid projectors).  Consequently, it will become cheaper and easier to set up small cinemas over the coming years.

This has led to speculation that the nature of the business will change, including the probable flourishing of specialist exhibitors and small low-cost distributors.  Coming as it does in concert with the widespread availability of movie-making equipment and the associated surge in movie-making, there is likely to be a fragmentation of the market, with greater niche exhibition outlets.

==The Internet==
The fast transmission of files across the internet leads to great fears of piracy of digital movies, and no provision has been made in the standard for the transportation of the authored movie file.  Distributors will use whatever means necessary (including perhaps physical transportation of discs) to minimise piracy.

With greater bandwidth increases there is also the possibility of electronic distribtution of movies across the internet, which may threaten traditional theatrical exhibition. This is currently seen as a niche, but companies like [[wikipedia:Filmbay]] are already adressing this.

==Technical==
The current standard requires that a feature must be authored into a single file, much as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd_authoring DVD is].  This file will contain not only the picture and sound media, but also additional soundtracks for countries outside the producer's own.  When installed into a cinema's dedicated server, the exhibitor will ensure the correct combination of soundtrack and subtitles will be played for the audience.  The exhibitor may put on a showing for hearing-impaired cinemagoers and allow the subtitles for the hard of hearing to be displayed.  

A dedicated link to a central database allows the distributor to monitor how many times a film has been played, and with what soundtracks.  Metadata embedded in the stream allow for automated dimming of lights and drawing of curtains.

The standard allows back-and-forward compatibility with 2k and 4k picture resolutions, intending to allay the fears of cinema owners worring that buying the available 2k equipment will find themselves in need of a further upgrade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Some comments by Metric1000==

No standards agency maintains one definition of a pound for commerce and another for everything else.

Pounds are defined as units of mass exactly equal to 0.45359237 kg all around the world, since a 1959 agreement among the national standards agencies of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.  This definition has also officially been adopted in other places such as Ireland.

Of course, that redefinition made no change whatsoever in what '''quantity''' (as we use that term for weights and measures) is represented by a pound.  It already was a unit of mass.  In fact, in the United States, it had already been defined as a slightly different exact fraction of a kilogram for 66 years before that common, international agreement was put into use.

Slugs are a little used, 20th century invention, something that didn't appear in physics textbooks before 1940 and which have since disappeared from most of them, along with the rest of the English units.

So yes, pounds-force do also exist.  Before the 20th century, they were never well-defined units, though they had already been used in low-precision applications for a couple of centuries before then.  For example, in the boiler of a locomotive, it doesn't really matter much whether the actual accurate value of the gauge pressure is 450 of some well-defined unit, or 475 of some well-defined unit; using a pound-force based on whatever the force on a mass of one pound, under the influence of the local gravitational field, isn't going to matter in these low-precision applications.

Slugs, of course, did not exist when the United States first redefined the pound as an exact fraction of a kilogram.

What, exactly, is a '''poundal'''?  It is part of a coherent foot-pound-second system, the absolute fps system, which is older than the gravitational fps system including the slug.  The poundal dates back to 1879, at least.

I'll even tell you what it is, so you don't have to look it up (unless you don't understand me or don't believe me).  The poundal is a derived unit of ''force''.  It is the force which will accelerate the base unit of ''mass'' in that system at a rate of one foot per second squared.  Now your homework, a simple fill in the blank:

:The '''base unit of mass''' in this oldest fps system is the _______________.

&lt;small&gt;HINT:  It is the &quot;p&quot; in this &quot;fps&quot; system.&lt;/small&gt;

[[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 11:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

== ditch the units ==

This is silly. The use of unnecessary units is bad, even if we didn't have to deal with poundforce and such. Do like this:

'''People on Endor are pulled down with 1.23456 times as much force as they would be on Earth.'''

That's the number you need if you want to take your weight, in ''any'' system of units, and multiply it by something to get a feel for the difference. It works for any loose idea of stones, pounds, newtons, grams, slugs, etc.

If you decide to get all scientific, you can argue about units for ''acceleration'', not force. Acceleration of gravity on Earth is 20/7 rods/microfortnight/microfortnight.

== hard boiling potatoes ==

Are the terms ''hard boiling'' and ''mealy boiling'' used for potatoes in english? The terms don't show up much (in connection with potatoes) on google and I couldn't find a translation either. 

In German there are three distinctions [http://www.kartoffel.de/diekartoffel/sorten/body.htm]: 
* festkochend (hard boiling)
* vorwiegend festkochend (mostly hard boiling)
* mehligkochend (mealy boiling)

I use the term ''hard boiling'' on [[Cookbook:Cheddar_%28Vegan%29|Cheddar (Vegan)]] now, please correct if there is a better term. --[[User:Fasten|Fasten]] 09:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Roasting potatoes ==

Instead of parboiling, try microwaving the potatoes for a couple of minutes before roasting.

I prefer the result from this to parboiled.  What do others think?


== Excellent ==

Oh, goodness, finally someone who shares my view that a little humour can only add to the enjoyment of a recipe. Love that semi-german comment above... what was he on?? Not spuds, thats for sure!  And we thought american contributors take themselves so seriously. 

Lovely recipes here... I hope you dont mind that I have added a small section for a Rosti. If you dont like it, feel free to take it down.. its your page after all !! Peter (sorry, havent a clue how to add that automatically !!)

:G'day Peter, nobody [[WB:OWN|owns]] this article, except everybody. You own it as much as the original contributors own it. [[WB:BOLD|Be bold]]! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:05, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

== various issues with this page ==

Generally badly written &amp; poorly presented using cut/paste recipes without explanation of cooking methods/temperatures and a lot of personal preferences expressed

Amongst other issues  -
&quot;On a cold day, few things are nicer than a baked potato.&quot; - really? says who?
&quot;Preheat the oven to very hot (gas mark 7)&quot; - no electric temperatures etc
&quot;grated cheese (something strong like cheddar or red Leicester), &quot; really? define a &quot;strong cheese&quot;
&quot;Eat the skin — it really is good for you.&quot; Why?
&quot;It is important to protect the potatoes from drying by covering them with a damp paper towel or coating them in oil.&quot; No it's not! a damp paper towel will dry out in the microwave and probably stick to the starchy liquid that seeps from the potato during cooking!

&quot;Described here is the basic method. Put the potatoes in whole.&quot; Deep Fry potatoes whole?
&quot;If you don't have any day-old bread to hand, drop one of your chips in&quot; - why? use of bread to test oil temp isn't explained
&quot;Add the chips, using a frying basket.&quot; - hang on a moment ago we were frying the potato whole!
&quot;Keep a fire blanket or damp towel nearby at all times.&quot; no explanation of why (&amp; that this is only a concern if using a stove top deep fat frying pan.

&quot;Now, add the potato mixture to DRY (yes, really) frying pan and spread out evenly.....N.B.: Traditionally, Roesti either have butter or fat mixed into the grated potato before frying, or are fried in fat or oil.&quot; unexplained contradiction - obviously cut/paste from a recipe but without explanation this makes little sense
 
&quot;Stewing is a great way to take care of left over potatoes.&quot; is it? who says?
&quot;Potato stew goes well with sausages, meatballs, or smoked, salted or gravad fish.&quot; does it? 
[[Special:Contributions/81.179.30.155|81.179.30.155]] ([[User talk:81.179.30.155|discuss]]) 22:57, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

== glycoalkaloids ==
As of this writing, the article says: &quot;''If potatoes are exposed to light, they will develop green areas or start to sprout. These areas should be trimmed before using. Sprouts and green parts can be very poisonous, as they contain glycoalkaloids, solanine and chaconine. Although the green colour is caused by chlorophyll and is harmless, it may indicate the formation of the glycoalkaloids, so one should discard any green parts of such potatoes.''&quot;

According to [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xf5Q4jo_mEEC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Resilient Gardner] glycoalkaloids are independent of the green color, the book claims that once a potato has developed green skin, it is no longer acceptable for animal feed use, and cannot be saved by peeling or trimming techniques.  Thus, the excerpted paragraph from the article page may be incorrect, and may be giving advice that could result in the consumption of glycoalkaloids.

==Tagged (Formatted) Files Text Editing==
===Working with Tags===

OmegaT displays the in-line formatting information of supported formats (at present HTML, XHTML, OpenDocument, and OpenOffice.org/StarOffice) as tags. The tags that are visible in OmegaT are not the same as those used by the original format; OmegaT converts them internally, and converts them back at compilation when the target documents are created.

Care must be exercised with tags. If they are accidentally changed, the formatting of the final file may be corrupted. In the worst case scenario a file may not open altogether; this occurs with OpenOffice.org files in particular.

Although custom formatting cannot be performed from within OmegaT, it is possible to apply some degree of control over the existing format.
====OpenDocument and OpenOffice.org File Tag Manipulation====

OpenDocument and OpenOffice.org tags must be preserved as is. Tags are paired as opening ( &lt;f&gt;) and closing ( &lt;/f&gt;) tags with consecutive numbers, starting from 1, in each segment. These tags cannot be deleted, duplicated, or have their sequence changed. However, it is possible to:

* move tags to a different part of the segment; as long as they remain in the same order;
* cancel tags by placing them next to each other.

:For instance, if the tagged sentence

 This text is in &lt;f1&gt;italics&lt;/f2&gt;.

:is changed to

 This text is in &lt;f1&gt;&lt;/f2&gt;italics.

:the italic formatting is effectively removed.

====HTML/XHTML File Tag Manipulation====

In HTML or XHTML the beginning of formatting is marked by an opening tag of the form &lt;x&gt;, and the end of formatting by a corresponding closing tag &lt;/x&gt; (where x represents the characters of a particular tag element). These tags have matching numbers, starting from 0, in each segment. Essentially, any changes made to tags must be made to both tags of the same pair.

The following rules for tags are applicable:

* Deletion is permitted (e.g. to remove italics from

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;

:simply delete the tags &lt;x0&gt; and &lt;/x0&gt;).

* Duplication is permitted (e.g. in

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;, and so is &lt;x1&gt;this&lt;/x1&gt;

:the same formatting of &quot;italics&quot; is applied to &quot;this&quot;).

* Change of order is permitted (e.g.

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;, this text is &lt;x1&gt; underlined&lt;/x1&gt;

:can be changed to

 This text is &lt;x1&gt;underlined&lt;/x1&gt;, this text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;)

* Nesting is permitted (e.g.

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics&lt;/x0&gt;, this text is &lt;x1&gt;underlined&lt;/x1&gt;

:can be changed to

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics and &lt;x1&gt;this text is also underlined&lt;/x1&gt;&lt;/x0&gt;)

* Overlap is not permitted (tagging like this

 This text is in &lt;x0&gt;italics, this text is also &lt;x1&gt;underlined&lt;/x0&gt;, this text is underlined but not in italics&lt;/x1&gt;

:is not allowed and will corrupt the file. Insertion of an opening tag followed by a second opening tag requires the closing tag of the second opening tag to come before the closing tag of the first.

===Tag Validation===

The validate tags function (''Tools &gt; Validate Tags'') detects changed tags (whether done deliberately or by accident), and indicates the affected segments. Use of this function will open a dialog with any suspected broken or bad tags in a document.

This function can be useful for tracking down bugs in a translated tagged text. This is often a problem in OpenDocument or OpenOffice.org files that will not open due to tag problems created in the process of translation. Fixing the tags and recreating the target documents again can often remedy the problem.

==File Filters==

A new addition starting with OmegaT version 1.4.5 is user configurable file (conversion) filters.

===Overview===

File filters are responsible for:

* reading a source document in from a file in a specific format (e.g. different filters exist for handling plaintext and OpenDocument/OpenOffice files);
* extracting translatable content from a file;
* writing the target document out to file (replacing translatable content with its translation in the process).

Since the filters are a new addition in this release there may still be unknown bugs, user interface quirks, and unclear procedure–hopefully this documentation will help clear up a few things in that respect. At present the user interface text for the file filters is only available in English. This is a limitation of the current version that will be remedied in a newer version of OmegaT.

Please use realistic settings when configuring filters or else unexpected results may occur. Read the instructions carefully and, if the results of manipulating the filters is not understood, stick with the default settings or work with a test project before using them on serious work. Ask questions on the OmegaT users group to get more help.

Take note that file filters can only be configured when there is no project open. To modify file handling for a particular project it must be done before the project is opened.

===Filter Dialogs===

The details for each of the dialogs and filter usage is given here.

====File Filters====

Access to this dialog is gained by selecting ''File Filters...'' from the ''Settings'' menu.

Within the dialog a table of the available file formats that can be handled is presented. The left column shows the available filter types. The right column shows a checkbox next to each filter type that indicates whether it is enabled (i.e. with a check mark) or not.

Currently available filter types are: text, XHTML, HTML, OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org, and Java Resource Bundles.

To edit a file filter from the types available highlight it and select the ''Edit...'' button to open the ''Edit File Filter'' configuration dialog for it.

To reset the file filters after changes have been made select the ''Defaults'' button. Select ''OK'' for the reset to defaults to take effect or ''Cancel'' to back out of the reset. Be sure that resetting the filters to defaults is what is wanted before accepting the changes.

====Edit File Filters====

Access this from the ''File Filters'' dialog via the ''Edit...'' button.

The user is presented here with a four column table for the file filter type selected. The table contains the headings: ''Source Filename Pattern, Source File Encoding, Target File Encoding,'' and ''Target Filename Pattern'' for the configured settings of a particular filter. These are used for the following purposes:

* Source Filename Pattern - determines which files in the '''/source''' directory will have the particular filter applied to them. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences.
* Source File Encoding - the character encoding in effect for the source files. Used to read in the source files. Has a drop down list from which to choose encodings.
* Target File Encoding - the character encoding in effect for the target files. Used to write out the target files. Has a drop down list from which to choose encodings.
* Target Filename Pattern - determines the pattern used to assign filenames to the target documents created in '''/target'''. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences.

On the right side of the dialog are the buttons ''Add...'', ''Edit...'', and ''Remove...'' that are used to open the ''Add Filter, Edit Filter,'' and ''Remove Filter'' dialogs, respectively

There is another ''Defaults'' button available in this dialog also. Use of this button will reset the filters for the filter type back to its original number of filters and default settings. Again, be sure this is exactly what is wanted before using it.

===Add Filter &amp; Edit Filter===

Access these from the ''Edit File Filters'' dialog via the ''Add...'' and ''Edit...'' buttons, respectively.

These dialogs and their instructions are the same, but their use is slightly different. User defined filters are created in the ''Add Filter'' dialog. A newly created filter is added to the list of available filters for the particular type of filter through this dialog. Default and user defined filters are edited in the ''Edit Filter'' dialog. A chosen filter is updated when changes are accepted there.

Each dialog contains a number of entries that must be filled in to properly configure the settings of a filter. These correspond to the settings seen in the ''Edit File Filters'' dialog. Select ''OK'' to add a new filter or accept changes to an existing filter, or ''Cancel'' to back out of the particular operation.

====Source Filename Pattern====

Specify the pattern used to the determine which files in the /source directory will have the particular filter applied to them. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences and within the limits of normal shell (glob) patterns.

Enter the appropriate source file pattern in the text area. There is a default pattern set here which depends on the particular filter under consideration. Use the default or set a custom one according to the specific source files that are to be used with the filter.
Source File Encoding

Specify the source file character encoding. This can be determined externally and entered (e.g. known ahead of time, from OpenOffice.org, etc.), by the file extension for some preset file formats (i.e. plaintext in Latin-1 uses *.txt1. or, if applicable, the &lt;auto&gt; setting can be used. For some formats the ability to change the encoding will be disabled. See the Encodings section on this page for details on the &lt;auto&gt; and disabled settings.

Select the appropriate encoding from the drop down list, or use &lt;auto&gt; for a filter to be automatically selected to read source files in with.
Target File Encoding

Specify the target file character encoding. The target documents will be created with the selected encoding. It may be a good idea to know the encoding required ahead of time for the particular target locale. If applicable, the &lt;auto&gt; setting can be used to attempt to automatically set the encoding. Again, for some formats the ability to change the encoding will be disabled. See the Encodings section on this page for details on the &lt;auto&gt; and disabled settings.
Target Filename Pattern

Specify the pattern used to assign filenames to the target documents created in /target. Patterns can be customized according to the users' preferences, within the limits of normal shell (glob) patterns.

Enter the appropriate target file pattern in the text area. The default pattern set here depends on the particular filter under consideration. Use the default or set up a custom pattern to alter the filenames of the target files for this filter. There are a number of preset filename variables available for this purpose.
Filename Variables

For the Target Filename Pattern there are few preset filename variables that can be used to help create the filenames of the target documents. The syntax of these variables is ${VARIABLE} and follows from commonly known glob patterns in shell (command line) usage. A variable is used in line in the Target Filename Pattern text area to insert the filename variables' values that are determined from the files and settings in a project.

Select a filename variable from the drop down list. Use the Insert button to put a selected variable at the cursor location in the Target Filename Pattern text area.
Filename Variables Variable	Description
${filename}	filename of a source file (name and extension)
${nameOnly}	source file name only, without the extension
${extension}	source file extension only
${sourceLanguage}	project's source language (locale) (xx-YY or xx_YY)
${targetLocale}	project's target locale (xx_YY)
${targetLanguage}	project's target language (xx-YY)
${targetLanguageCode}	project's target language code (xx)
${targetCountryCode}	project's target country code (YY)

${filename} is the default configuration for the Target Filename Pattern in most cases, which means that the source file name and target (translated) file names will be the same.

See Sample Project for information on language (locale) and codes.
Remove Filter

This is a confirmation dialog only. Select OK to permanently remove a filter. User defined filters will not be available after confirming their removal. The default filters for a particular file format will also not be available if removed, but these can be restored from the Edit File Filters dialog by selecting Defaults.
Encodings

Encodings for source and target are selectable from the drop down lists in the Edit File Filters, Add Filter, and Edit Filter dialogs. The encodings available are limited to those in the Java Runtime Environment in operation. In addition, an &lt;auto&gt; variable can be used to attempt to automatically detect the source file encoding required.
&lt;auto&gt; Setting

Depending upon the particular filter in use, one of three actions will be taken when an &lt;auto&gt; setting is encountered:

   1. OmegaT will attempt to determine the encoding automatically; applies to source files only.
   2. the default encoding of the operating system will be used.
   3. no action will occur. This happens when the filter only supports a single source and target encoding.

Disabled(Grayed Out) Setting

The particular filter with the disabled variable does not support multiple file encodings or the file format is encoding-neutral. In which case there is no way to specify another encoding.
Example: Target Filename Pattern

Perhaps it would be nice to change the target filenames to reflect the particular target language or locale being translated to. One possibility is to add a suffix to the file names (before the extension). For instance, if the target language is French, then the addition of the language code might be good.

In this case the pattern could be

${nameOnly}-fr.${extension},

but there is already a variable for the target language code so insert that variable instead to give

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguageCode}.${extension}.

Now, if a source file was named test.txt. (e.g. under the *.txt. text filter) the target filename for it would become test-fr.txt.

Note that the filename separator '.'. is not inserted by using ${extension}, it must be manually included in the pattern if you want it.

Continuing, perhaps the country code would be nice also. It could be added with

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguageCode}-CA.${extension}

for the case of French as the target language and Canada as the country. In this case test.txt. would become test-fr-CA.txt.

In this case, there is already a variable for the target country code available so insert that variable to give

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguageCode}-${targetCountryCode}.${extension}

Much more simply for the case at hand, just insert the target language in place of the target language code and target country code filename variables.

${nameOnly}-${targetLanguage}.${extension}

The result is the same in the last two cases as before. In this example the target filename now has the language (language plus country code) tacked on as a suffix to all of the files names before the extension, the extension is unaltered.
Questions &amp; Answers
How is the filter that works with a file determined?

This is determined by a file's pattern. Each filter lists the source file pattern of the files it can handle. This can be set by adding or editing a file filter. Each filter may have a distinct pattern associated with it. For example, if the plaintext filter is to be used to handle all files without an extension, add or edit a filter to have a *.. source filename pattern. There are also a few preset filters that work with a specific file type, but use different encodings. For example, a Latin-1 encoded plaintext file can be recognized by the .txt1 extension. All files can be given a particular pattern ahead of using them in a project so they will automatically be recognized. In the example, the extension was the determining factor for associating files with a filter.
What if a file encoding seems incorrect?

Set up another encoding instead by changing the Source File Encoding of the appropriate file filter.
What can be done if a single encoding does not work well for the source and target languages?

In reality, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings will work in almost all cases. It is possible to use one of these encodings for source and target together. To use two different encodings for source and target ensure that the appropriate encodings are chosen for each character set and that the source document files are saved in the proper encoding before opening the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have been interested in hearing from people who want to make a vast improvement to the stock exchange component along with serious modification to monopoly as well... 

While Parker Brothers put this Stock Exchange c. 1936 add on to MONOPOLY c. 1935 Their basic change does very little to the game ... excpt use for collateral or collect dividends... and the CHESSEX version did allow for more options and minor conditions in the Stock Exchange Market, my ideas are worth quite a few serious changes in the game.  

For starts:

You can buy a house or a property at the mortgaged price just like you do today. 

Each time you pass go you collect your go salary less 10 % of your morgaged properties because You rent out part of that to a renter and pay part of the interest on the mortgage ... the bank gets that rent as interest only on the mortgaged property. To pay the Mortgage you must pay it off in full plus 10 % interest.   

Instead of just buying your property at face value when you land on it you can do 4 things now:

a] Buy the property at its mortgaged value 

b] pay the bank the rent it says on the title deed *

 * this idea was in the Landlord game copyright 1904 ... 

c] buy the property at full value 

d] auction it off and if you don't buy the property the you pay the rent to the winner of the auction... if nobody buys the property you must pay double rent to the bank. This is because the bank acted as your agent at the auction to sell the new property and the bank ain't free

If you land on someone's mortgaged property should not exempt the lander from paying the rent like Parker Brothers rules say it should ... Here the Bank collects the rent as &quot;interest on the Amortized mortgage as it would in real life.&quot; 

Taking Boardwalk as the example you can:
  
a] buy property at $200 [$200 mortgage]
b] Pay $50 rent for landing there to the bank 
c] Pay $ 400 full price to the bank
d] hold an auction to buy it at whoever wishes to get it ... if you are the highest bidder just pay the highest bid to the Bank. If you are not, you pay $50 rent to the winner of the auction. If nobody buys it after an auction was declared, you pay $100 rent. [PS who would not jump at buying Boardwalk for $1 but there are properties that people might not buy at all on any auction.

Instead of having just the stock exchange selling stocks and paying dividends .. I propose a few chaanges .. 

a] buy a single stock any time on your turn at list value plus a broker's fee of 10 %... or for List price plus $1 broker's fee on stock exchange for all transactions 

b] usng your photocopy of the set from Hasbro of the stock exchange parts photocopy the shares and change the values to make the stocks go from $10 to $200  a share in increments of $10 print out a minimum of 15 copies of these shares ...

Make some market change cards that affect the whole market [GO salary, Shares, stock market and real estate market 2 areas in real estate title deeds and house/hotel fluctuations ... ranging from -10 to + 10 range level 
  
the 0 level is the original starting point of the entire market 

make a scaled market value sheet affecting every one 

Make dividend sheet for all 20 different stock certificates ...  

Stock levels go from 0 x [hand in stocks and reset the market level to normal] to Double value [Hand in get a split 2 for 1 on every stock you own 
title deed prices are also fluctuating at different rates ..

You can add a bank foreclosure give up a property 
or a house  to chance /comunity chest 

A bankrupt card ... hand all in and start over and even if you own almost all the property. Yes Mary,  millionaires do go broke in poor investments. 

It cost you low rates or high damage claims on you 

...you will be changing stocks frequently when you own these stocks will change so you need to have the incremented stocks .... 
Bull market ... all prices go up one level   
Bear Marker .. all prices go down 1 level 
High inflation market prices jump up three levels
Recession cause the market to go down 3 level 
 
Each level is calculated at a differnt percentage from normal or starting point ... houses and title deeds are thus fluctuating as well..   

What interesting is that some of these cards in chance and community chest affect all the people on the board....  Builders do go ON strike so you can't build until all PLAYERS PASS GO.

AND STOCK EXCHANGE ALLOWS FREE PARKING ONLY IF YOU DO BUSINESS WITH THE MARKET ... IT'S NOW METERED PARKING IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ON THAT SQUARE YOU HAVE SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO ... OR BUY A STOCK FOR $11 DOLLAR [$ 1 BROKER FEE] PAY A $15 PARKING FEE, ROLL THE DICE AND TAKE SOME CHANCES ... INCLUDING A TRIP TO THE CITY JAIL OR PAYING DOUBLE RENT FOR DAMAGING SOMEONE'S HOTEL.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Weight vs. Mass Wikijunior article ==

While I would agree that Metric1000 is perhaps going over the top and not seeking ways to compromise, you do need to pay attention to the arguments he is making.  There is some sound science regarding what he is trying to suggest.  He doesn't seem to complain too much about the &quot;effects of Gravity&quot; section I wrote, and certainly can't change the numbers in any way to reflect any differences in what it is saying from the mass vs. weight argument.  In fact, it bypasses the argument altogether, which is why I've tried to go that route.

In short, give up trying to revert his changes when you try to say that you &quot;weigh&quot; 5 kg on the Moon if you weigh 30 kg on the Earth.  Technically it isn't accurate anyway, which is precisely what he is trying to say.  The question I'm trying to raise (and have tried to raise) is what kinds of experiences would be different if you were inside a large enclosed pressurized space (with the volume of an indoor athletic arena... certainly a possibility in the future).

I have suggested that Quiddich would become a very real sport on the Moon, due to the fact that human powered flight would be possible.  I have no doubt that some enterprising soul would even come up with a contraption like the &quot;golden snitch&quot; that has some sort of interesting AI built into it as well.  It would also be an athletic competition that would be encouraged by residents on the Moon to keep their bodies toned up to avoid muscular atrophy from not fighting the constant 9.8 m/s^2 gravity that is on the Earth.  BTW, this isn't a new concept.  In fact, Robert Heinlein came up with the concept in his novel &quot;The Menace from Earth&quot; that talks about sport flight on the moon in some large volcanic chambers that were pressure sealed on the Moon.

What other cool things would be possible due to a change in gravity and how would life be different?  &quot;Weighing&quot; less is but one aspect that can be covered.  I'm sure we can come up with some other cool ideas as well.  Can we come up with some other lunar games and sports that would be impossible on the Earth?  Burt Rutan (the guy that build Scaled Composites' Space Ship One that won the X-Prize) suggested with a low enough gravity that you could &quot;walk&quot; on water due to surface tension, and at least be swimming much faster due to less of your body being submersed inside the water.  Mr. Rutan wants to experience that first hand with a space station containing a reduced  g swimming pool and even showed the plans for it to Mike Wallace on the CBS television show 60 Minutes.

Let's be creative here and not get bogged down into a petty edit fight.  We can be better than Metric1000 in that aspect because all that contributor has accomplished is to get people like you pissed at him.  IMHO, lets just get rid of the weight vs. mass section completely.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:18, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

: ''Thanks for your response, Rob. I tried to acknowledge Metric1000's point about usage, history and law in more than one of my replies on the talk page, but this seems not to've worked - or, at least, I did not do this sufficiently strongly. Given the manner of his posts, however, I decided especially calm and circumspect reponses were needed.

: ''In the module itself, I hope I only removed his preaching that there's no difference between 'mass' and 'weight' rather than engage in reversion. If it appears to be outright reversion I apologise and take note. As regards my contributions not being technically accurate, I am aware of this but at the same am aware this is meant to be a module in a book for children. I just wanted to point out that science has distinct uses for the terms 'mass' and 'weight' and that their weight according to a bathroom scale would change from planet to planet or the like. I'd say that as most of us aren't practising scientists we don't use the word 'mass' that much in our everyday life on Earth, so all the more reason to confirm that what we think of here on Earth as 'weight' changes if we're on other planets etc or moving in certain ways, such as the example of orbiting. I don't believe being comprehensive or especially accurate matters here; just making the point that something - 'weight' - changes.

: ''This is why I'd like to propose your approach as a solution. Yes, perhaps I may've been more creative in my attempts to point out to Metric1000 that changes in weight occur from place to place in the universe. I certainly hope, however, that I haven't been engaged in - and, most of all, haven't appeared willing or happy to engage in - an edit fight.

Since you removed the &quot;this module is finished&quot; noticed, the module is getting &quot;unfinished&quot;.  Words are getting added.  The reading level is going up.  I am almost convinced that it is absolutely impossible to get an entire book ready for publication at the same time.

Do you  have any ideas on how to get a module proofread and then held static?

Thanks for your thoughts

: ''I'd suggest something along the lines of the following. Have an administrator announce that a module is to undergo a final period of copyediting and proofreading, leading to a vote to protect that version of the module from further editing. All those wishing to take part in the vote have N days in which to register their interest. After that, once those who have registered to vote reach a consensus that the module is ready, the supervising administrator protects that version of the module and anyone else who has come along since (or who didn't register their interest, etc) will be editing what will/might become the next version of the module. Once this has occurred for all modules, you have a first (second, third, etc) version of the Wikibook for printing.

: ''As regards my intervention in the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Our Solar System]] module, this arose because I have begun to work my way through the Wikijunior Solar System modules removing the adult-style superscripted reference numbers, URLs, etc from the text and replacing them with quotes from the text linked to the references in each module's separate References section. While beginning to do this for [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Our Solar System]] I felt there were some fundamental steps missing from the story outlined at the start of the module. If my attempt to insert them has created too demanding a text, I apologise and believe it should be possible to resimplify the text without losing them.

=== proofreading [[Wikijunior Solar System]]===
Are you familiar with the process of rounding up admins, getting them to do stuff, etc?  I'm not.  If you want to propose a change in the finished project of the proofreading process, why not go ahead and do that.  Follow your own approach.  Do &quot;we&quot; agree on taking the references out right now?  How about on how to do that?  The nice thing about having them where they are is that they show which facts have been checked.

: ''A vote was started sometime ago [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#References.|here]] on how to treat referencing and as there has been no votes or comments against keeping them away from the text, I have forged onward. I believe young people prefer reading texts without superscripts or the like (see [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Footnotes|here]]). I'm aware that the format I'm implementing is less specific, but so far I feel it is still sufficiently specific to indicate the source/s of nearly each and every fact. Since most of the references I've parsed thus far refer to the same four or so sources per modules, I'm tempted to plan a second pass through them to remove such redundancy. I would however propose such an idea first.

Back on the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Any target audience trials?|Wikijunior Solar System talk page]] (and perhaps elsewhere) I've enquired whether anyone has easy contact with a bunch of 7-12 year olds so we can benefit from some feedback. Elsewhere someone has mentioned they received a positive response from a (or maybe a few) young person/people but I'd like to feel reassured about the assumptions modules already make about young people's grasp of numbers, scale, history, etc, etc before I unwittingly add any more.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called David Kernow. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name David Kernow~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

==== ASTM ====
*[[W:ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]], ''Standard for Metric Practice,'' E 380-79, ASTM 1979.
**     '''3.4.1.2''' Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass.  In commercial and everyday use, the term weight nearly always means mass; thus, when one speaks of a person's weight, the quantity referred to is mass. . . .  Because of the dual use of the term weight as a quantity, this term should be avoided in technical practice except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear.  When the term is used, it is important to know whether mass or force is intended and to use SI units properly as described in 3.4.1.1, by using kilograms for mass or newtons for force.
**     '''3.4.1.3''' Gravity is involved in determining mass with a balance or scale.  When a standard mass is used to balance the measured mass, the effects of gravity on the two masses are equalized, but the effects of the buoyancy of air or other fluid on the two masses are generally not equalized.  When a spring scale is used, the scale reading is directly related to the force of gravity.  Spring scales graduated in mass units may be properly used if both the variation in acceleration of gravity and the buoyancy corrections are not significant in their use.
**     '''3.4.1.4''' The use of the same name for units of force and mass causes confusion.  When the non-SI units are used, a distinction should be made between force and mass, for example, lbf to denote force in gravimetric engineering units and lb for mass.

==== NIST ====
*[[w:NIST|U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Dr. Barry N. Taylor, ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units,'' NIST Special Publication 811, [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec08.html#8.3]
** Thus the SI unit of the quantity weight used in this sense is the kilogram (kg) and the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; means &quot;to determine the mass of&quot; or &quot;to have a mass of&quot;.
** Examples:  the child's weight is 23 kg
::::the briefcase weighs 6 kg 
::::Net wt. 227 g
* [Note that the same section also defines weight in a different meaning from this one which is proper for body weight; in that other meaning, &quot;Thus the SI unit of the quantity weight defined in this way is the newton (N).&quot;  This section also concludes with the excellent advice, &quot;In any case, in order to avoid confusion, whenever the word &quot;weight&quot; is used, it should be made clear which meaning is intended.&quot;]

==== National Standard of Canada ====
*The National Standard of Canada, CAN/CSA-Z234.1-89 ''Canadian Metric Practice Guide,'' January 1989:
**'''5.7.3'''  Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term &quot;weight.&quot; In commercial and everyday use, the term &quot;weight&quot; nearly always means mass.  In science and technology, &quot;weight&quot; has primarily meant a force due to gravity.  In scientific and technical work, the term &quot;weight&quot; should be replaced by the term &quot;mass&quot; or &quot;force,&quot; depending on the application.
**'''5.7.4'''  The use of the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; meaning &quot;to determine the mass of,&quot; e.g., &quot;I weighed this object and determined its mass to be 5 kg,&quot; is correct.
:[An interesting thing to note here is a significant difference in usage of the noun forms and the verb forms.]

==== SAE ====
*[[W:Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] TSB003, ''Rules for SAE use of SI (Metric) Units,'' May 1999:
**'''7.4.2''' Considerable confusion exists in the use of the term weight as a quantity to mean either force or mass. In commercial and everyday use, the term weight nearly always means mass; thus, when one speaks of a person's weight, the quantity referred to is mass. This nontechnical use of the term weight in everyday life will probably persist. In science and technology, the term weight of a body usually meant the force that, if applied to the body, would give it an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall. The adjective &quot;local&quot; in the phrase &quot;local acceleration of free fall&quot; usually meant a location on the surface of the earth. In this context, the &quot;local acceleration of free fall&quot; has the symbol g (commonly referred to as &quot;acceleration of gravity&quot;). Values of g differing by over 0.57 at various points on the earth's surface have been observed.2 In a technical context, the use of force of gravity (mass times acceleration of gravity), instead of weight with this meaning is recommended. Because the term weight is ambiguous, care should be taken to assure that the intended meaning is clear.

:: Am I reading this correctly that values of &quot;g&quot; (or average acceleration due to gravity on Earth at 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being the usual figure) varies by 0.57?  Is that 0.57 &quot;g's&quot;, or 0.57 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 0.57%?  I can see some altitude variations (Mt. Everest vs. Dead Sea) or lattitude (polar vs. equitorial gravity effects).  Measuring the local gravity field was an experiment I did in High School physics class, BTW.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:12, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::: I'm sure that 0.57% was intended, though the pdf file only has the quoted &quot;0.57&quot;.  Actually, the normal gravity '''at sea level''' increases by more than 0.53% from the equator to the poles (9.7803267715 m/s² to 9.8321863685 m/s²), and with local anomalies from those normal values it is possible that the actual measured values at sea level could vary by 0.57%.  The average at sea level (Geodetic Reference System 1980) is 9.797644656 m/s².[http://www.gfy.ku.dk/~iag/handbook/geodeti.htm] Throw in Mt. Chimborazo, the highest mountain on Earth in both ways relevant to this discussion, and the variation on the surface of the Earth, from there to the North Pole is more than 0.7%.  
::: With that Everest and Dead Sea stuff, you remind me of the fools at Aviation Now, who tried to make a point by comparing the force of gravity on an elephant at the Denver Zoo and at the San Diego Zoo.  In addition to much confusion about kilograms as units of force and using conversion factors too imprecise for their measurements and the like, they also failed to figure out the most important factor: that the acceleration of gravity at the San Diego Zoo is actually '''less''' than it is at the Denver Zoo, not the other way around.  Latitude is a more important factor than altitude is.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:40, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

==== National Physical Laboratory (U.K.) ====
*[[W:National Physical Laboratory|NPL]] FAQ [http://www.npl.co.uk/force/faqs/forcemassdiffs.html]
*Weight
:In the trading of goods, weight is taken to mean the same as mass, and is measured in kilograms. Scientifically however, it is normal to state that the weight of a body is the gravitational force acting on it and hence it should be measured in newtons, and this force depends on the local acceleration due to gravity. To add to the confusion, a weight (or weightpiece) is a calibrated mass normally made from a dense metal, and weighing is generally defined as a process for determining the mass of an object.

:So, unfortunately, weight has three meanings and care should always be taken to appreciate which one is meant in a particular context.

==== U.S. Federal Standard 376B ====
* Federal Standard 376B, &quot;Preferred Metric Units for General Use by the Federal Government,&quot; January 27, 1993 [http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/200/202/fs376b.htm]
**In commercial and everyday use, and in many technical fields, the term &quot;weiqht&quot; is usually used as a synonym for mass. This is how 'weight&quot; is used in most United States laws and regulations. See the note at 5.2.1 for further explanation. 
**... [note at 5.2.1]
**NOTE: There is ambiguity in the use of the term weight to mean either force or mass. In general usage, the term weighr nearly always means mass and this is the meaning given the term in U.S. laws and regulations.   Where the term is so used, weight is expressed in kilograms in SI. In many fields of science and technology the term weight is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object, i.e., as the product of the mass of the object and the local acceleration of gravity. Where weight is so defined, it is expressed in newtons in SI.

==== American National Metric Council ====
*American National Metric Council, &quot;Metric Editorial Guide,&quot; 3d ed. 1978
**'''7.1'''  In commercial and everyday use, the term &quot;weight&quot; nearly always means mass; the use of the word &quot;weight&quot; to mean &quot;mass&quot; and the word &quot;weigh&quot; to mean &quot;determine the mass of&quot; or &quot;have a mass of&quot; is acceptable.
::Examples:  My weight is 60 kilograms.
::::Weigh the envelope carefully.
::::The suitcase weighs 12 kilograms.
**'''7.2'''  Since the word &quot;weight is used to mean both mass and force, its use should be avoided in science and technology except under circumstances in which its meaning is completely clear.  In SI, mass is measured in kilograms, and force is measured in newtons.

==== International definition of a pound ====
*Here is the current '''official definition of a pound''' in the United States (and as you can see from the quote, in the rest of the world as well), and these are the pounds we use when we weigh ourselves &quot;at the doctor's office&quot;.  Federal Register Notice of July 1, 1959: [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf]
**''Announcement.'' Effective July 1, 1959, all calibrations in the U.S. customary system of weights and measures carried out by the National Bureau of Standards will continue to be based upon metric measurement standards and, except those for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey as noted below, will be made in terms of the following exact equivalents and appropriate multiples and submultiples:

::&lt;center&gt;1 yard= 0.914 4 meter&lt;/center&gt;

::&lt;center&gt;1 pound (avoirdupois)= 0.453 592 37 kilogram&lt;/center&gt;

::Currently, the units defined by these same equivalents, which have been designated as the International Yard and the International Pound, respectively, will be used by the National Standards Laboratories of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and United Kingdom; thus there will be brought about international accord on the yard and pound by the English-speaking nations of the world, in precise measurements involving these basic units.

== General discussion ==

=== Teachers who mislead students by ===

====&quot;Measure your weight in newtons&quot;====

There are too many teachers who, being confused about how we do this in the real world, and how we should do it, confuse their students by telling them that they should routinely measure their weight in newtons.

They should not do so.  The kilograms used throughout the world, including most hospitals in the United States, are the proper SI units for this weight.  Note, of course, that there are no kilograms-force in SI.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

There are hundreds of web sites, and even a few textbooks for introductory college science classes, and perhaps for junior high school or high school as well, which falsely claim that pounds are not units of mass. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== &quot;If you weighed 100 units...&quot; ===

Many teachers don't have any big problem understanding that as measurements of mass, kilograms do not vary no matter where you are (the situation is different with pounds, because few people really understand the old English units)

Note that the verb &quot;to weigh&quot; (as noted in the excerpts from the Canadian Standard for Metric Practice and the ANMC Guide above) is used to mean &quot;to measure the mass of&quot; or &quot;to have a mass of&quot; even many by those people who cannot bring themselves to use the historically, linguistically, and legally correct noun &quot;weight&quot; for the result of that measurement..  

If you want people to give up their rightful, prior claim to the word &quot;weight&quot;, then you had damn sure better give them a verb to use as well as a noun.  The use of &quot;to mass&quot; with the meaning above remains substandard usage which grates on the ears of most people, including most physicists and chemists and the like.  That's why they continue to use &quot;to weigh&quot; with that meaning, even if they switch words for the noun usage.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:24, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:This is an astronomy book, so we should use words primary in ways the astronomers themselves use them and then explain how it is different from everyday use and from the commerical and legal definitons. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 06:54, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::About the only way astronomers ever use &quot;weight&quot; is in the way it was used in Cavendish's famous paper, &quot;Weighing the Earth&quot;.  Plus the occasional stepping outside their field to mangle up the proper medical sciences meaning of the word weight, as we've seen here.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 09:15, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Additions by StarryTG ==

I left much of the additions by [[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] dealing with mass and gravity, but took out the two paragraphs in the &quot;What is weight?&quot; section.  Here is what was written, and why it was inappropriate.

=== One of several meanings ===

 Weight is the amount of gravitional force there is on an object with
 mass. The gravitional force could be from anything else with mass,
 such as a planet or moon. A given gravitional field would pull down
 on a more massive object with a larger force than a less massive object.

This is indeed one definition of the ambiguous word weight (but not quite a complete definition, because there are variations in the precise usage depending on factors such as rotation and buoyancy).  However, it is not the definition of weight which is proper &quot;in the doctor's office&quot; for our body weight.

Remember, we are building on what the students know.  This is not the &quot;weight&quot; they are most familiar with.  They see the &quot;net weight&quot; listed on billions of items in our grocery stores and haredware stores and car parts stores.  They see the 63 kg weight classes in Olympic boxing or wrestling or judo or whatever.  They calculate their body mass index&amp;mdash;the smarter ones doing it from height in meters and weight in kilograms, so they don't have to remember complicated conversion factors not useful in any other context. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Misstating the reasons ===

 Many people use the word weight to mean the same thing as mass. This
 works on Earth because the strength of gravity is about the same all
 over the world. However, we will see that the difference between weight
 and mass becomes noticable when we consider other planets.

We use the word &quot;weight&quot; with that meaning, because we've been doing so for over 1000 years.  This word entered Old English over 1000 years ago, meaning the quantity measured with a balance.  That quantity is mass, not force.

A thousand years ago, English-speakers used this weight as a measure of how much stuff they had, for the purpose of trade.  We still measure the very same quantity for the very same purposes today, and we still quite properly and legitimately call it &quot;weight&quot;.

A bag of sugar with a &quot;net weight&quot; of 2 kg would still have a net weight of 2 kg on Pluto.  A man with a weight of 175 lb would still have a weight of 175 lb on Mars, using the normal and proper meaning used in the medical sciences and in sports, the primary reasons we weigh ourselves. 

Yes, the change in the force due to gravity, and the unchanging mass, are both noticeable.  It is still as hard to throw a baseball on Mars at the same speed you'd throw it on Earth; it will take gravity a while longer to pull it to the ground, however. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

===After we got so &quot;smart&quot; we still measure the same thing ===

You might have some argument if, after we got to be so smart, we changed the quantity we measured for these purposes.  But that simply did not happen.

It doesn't '''work ... because the strength of gravity is about the same.'''  We simply aren't interested in how hard that pound of butter, or that 400 troy ounce bar of gold, is pressing down on our table.  We want that measurement to be the same no matter what the strength of the local gravitational field.  That's the way we use it; that's the way we've always done it.

We'd use the same units of measurement for that butter or that gold on the Moon or Mars as we do on Earth.  '''We'd still calibrate our scales on the Moon or on Mars the very same way that we do on Earth&amp;mdash;'''for the accurate measurement of mass in the very location in which they are used.  Just stop for a minute and think about the way those scales are tested and certified in the supermarket under government supervision, or in hospitals where the government isn't so concerned about it but the doctors are, because they want the numbers from a different ward in their hospital, or from a different hospital, to be comparable&amp;mdash;it is done the same way in either place.

In other words, we don't want to measure force, and we don't particularly care if some fools in their own jargon want to use our word &quot;weight&quot; with a different meaning for their own purposes.  Fortunately, however, nobody was ever damn fool enough to give any physics teacher any say-so in what the term &quot;net weight&quot; means in commerce, a term which never refers to a force (it is not a physics term).  Nor do &quot;troy weight&quot; and many other common terms which are always used to refer to mass, not force.

It's the same way with body weight.  We aren't suddenly more fit and healthy if gravity isn't pulling on us as hard.  If you are obese on Earth, you'd have pretty much the same problems related to obesity on Mars. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

===There is no God-given meaning of ''weight'' ===

The word &quot;mass&quot;, on the other hand, has only had this same meaning for about 275 years.  So those heathen tribesmen in merry Olde England weren't making any mistake, when they were unable to discern the God-given word they were supposed to invent for this purpose, instead of the word &quot;weight&quot; which they did invent.

We aren't making any mistake, when we continue to use the same word with the same meaning for the same purposes today. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Gravity varies significantly on Earth, too ===

Note further that while, if you use Fred Flintstone units such as kilograms-force or pounds-force, you can express the force due to gravity on Earth in numbers approximately equal to those for the corresponding measurements of mass in pounds or kilograms, the same does not hold true in the modern metric system, the International System of Units (SI).  (For that matter, it also does not hold true if you limit yourself to the absolute foot-poound-second system, or if you limit yourself to the gravitational foot-pound-second system, or if you limit yourself to the gravitational inch-pound-second system, etc.)

A mass of 1.00000 lb on Earth will exert a force of from 0.99535 lbf to 1.00260 lbf, and the same of course is true if you use the obsolete kilgrams-force.  But in SI, a mass of 1.00000 kg will exert a force of 9.7610 N to 9.8322 N on Earth.  That certainly matters if you are weighing a 400 oz t bar of platinum, but it also matters at the precision used when a boxer is &quot;making weight&quot;.

Even if you restrict yourself to sea level on Earth, the acceleration of gravity varies by more than 0.53%.  That's easily measurable, not just in the extremes but with very small changes in location. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 23:50, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== This will totally miss the point ==

I totally hate where this article goes, and is a very strong point-of-view that weight is totally silly.  Or that yout weight on another world will be the same as on the Earth.  It totally lacks the NPOV requirements of Wikpedia or all of the Wikimedia projects, and as such needs to be rewritten... perhaps even from scratch.

The whole point of talking about weight on different bodies in the solar system is more &quot;how much would I feel like I weight if I were on X?&quot;

For example, on a videotape I got for my kids, there was a clip of Harrison Schmidt picking up a boulder on the moon.  Tossing it arround and otherwise having a fun time.  Mission control was a little concerned, because the rock did have quite a bit of mass (and the ability to crush,smash helmets and the suit, etc.)  He also showed a very similar rock on the Earth, about the same size and mass, and simply stated there was no way he could possibly lift it up.  This other clip of him in an Arizona desert even showed him trying to lift it up.  He couldn't even budge it.

In short, there is a distinction between mass and weight, and it should be covered.  As written (and in the rest of the articles as written so far) there doesn't appear to be a real distinction, and this discussion is getting down to the ugly fine points that is just splitting hairs.  And rather silly at that.

Here is a distinction that matters to a kid if they were walking (in a spacesuit) on the Moon.  They could &quot;lift&quot; a much heavier rock, because their arms still have the same force and energy necessary to lift things on the Earth, but on the Moon, because gravity is weaker, they can lift more.  Mass is still the same, because if somebody tosses a 10 kg bag of potatoes at you, it will still hit you and knock you down just like it would here on the Earth.  The mass hasn't changed, but the force necessary to lift it has dropped.  Also, on the Moon you can jump up almost 16x as high because of the reduced gravity.  It also takes longer to fall down, again because gravity is lower.  All of this needs to be covered.

The exact opposite happens in high gravity environments, where you shouldn't even try to jump in gravity environments that high (it would break your bones if you tried), but rolling a 10kg ball over could be stopped with just as much force as it would here on the Earth.

Yes, let's be accurate, and let's talking about mass and force correctly (assuming that weight is defined as the force caused by gravity upon a mass of a certain size).  These are kids we are talking about, however, and it is important to let them know that if they were walking on the moon, that they could jump much higher and lift much heavier things.  The real question is how to we explain that idea and how can we describe in something they can understand what it would feel like, using just words? [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:41, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:So, what do you suppose happens when someone throws a 25 lb bag of potatoes at you on the Moon, compared to someone throwing a 25 lb bag of potatoes at you on the Earth?  It will knock you down just like it would here on Earth.

:What do you suppose happens were you to get hit by a 330 lb (150 kg) National Football League lineman on the moon?  Or get punched by a boxer who is in the 90 [[kg]] '''weight class''' for the Olympics?  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 20:51, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

:: Yeah, if you get hit by a 330 lb (150 kg) lineman from the National Football League on the moon (presumably in a large domed habitat like Heinlein's &quot;Meanace From Earth&quot;), the poor center would be flung over the goal post as a result.  Of course that 330 lb lineman can't just use his weight to drop down on somebody taking advantage of gravity, but instead has to use more of a mass concept of gaining momentum before hitting their opponent.

::There are indeed differences, and a game of football (American or International---soccer as it were) would be very different on the Moon.  The Quarterback (in American Football) wouldn't merely be doing a forward pass, but being passed forward himself in a high orbit above the field.  In many ways, it would be more like a game of Quidditch rather than the ground-based game most people are familiar with.  Real life human-powered flight could take place on the Moon, making a game of Quidditch likely to be a real sport on the Moon, broken bones and all.  As for boxing on the Moon, I think you would find it much harder to get a firm footing on the ground.  &quot;Pro wrestling&quot;, like the WWF, would have some incredible fun on the Moon where they could do acrobatics like jumping over their opponent and landing directly on their opponent's head with their feet, or doing other more bizzare gymnastics moves.  Take a look at some of the clients that [http://www.nogravity.com/ Zero G Adventure] has to get an idea.  This is no longer just the stuff of NASA or government astronauts anymore. 

::This reply didn't really answer the question, which is that some sort of terminology needs to be used to describe these effects due to reduced or substantially increased gravity.  So how do we describe it if you are suggesting that using kilograms as a unit of &quot;weight&quot; has the same meaning as on the Earth, and that 100 kg on the Moon is identical to 100 kg on the Earth?  I beg to differ that there are no differences, because there are some very substantial differences as to how you would behave, primarily because our mussels don't push against mass but rather against force.  Saying that you can run and jump like on the Earth when you are on the Moon is simply too ludicrious to even think about.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:33, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== 110 pounds? ==
I've changed the weights from 110 pounds to 87 pounds (and corresponding metric and stone weights) to more accurately reflect those of a 10 year old boy or girl (average 10yo boy = 85, average 10yo girl = 88), according to [http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/healthcare/a/tallbutfat.htm about.com]). I figured children aged 8-11 wouldn't identify with someone weighing 110 pounds, or at least it would be more relative if it was closer to their weight.--[[User:Tim Thomason|Tim Thomason]] 20:42, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:Good idea.  I'll tweak it a tiny bit, however, because using 39 kg = 86 lb as a conversion factor would give you an error of only 1 part in 4630 (39.000 kg = 85.980 lb, 86.000 lb = 39.009 kg, whereas using 87 lb = 39 kg would give an error of 1 part in 85). [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 10:47, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

::I'm confused as to the purpose of the chart at all, especially since the pound is already ambiguous between a mass and weight unit so it's not really clear what we're trying to get at.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 00:47, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

== Leaning Tower of Pisa ==

Nice pictures of the balls falling from the tower, even if they would be pretty huge balls if that's to scale.

Unfortunately, the story in the text isn't true.  Galileo didn't do that.  He did do some experiments rolling balls down an inclined ramp, timing them with a water clock.  See [[w:Galileo Galilei]].  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 09:21, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

: I agree; see thread below ([[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#Rewrite?|Rewrite?]]). [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 04:04, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A diode usually is thought of as a device that lets current flow through/thru it in only ONE direction; however '''Zener diodes''' are made to permit current to flow also in the reverse direction if the voltage that is applied is larger than the rated &quot;Zener voltage&quot;. Zener diodes are therefore used as voltage sources, with different Zener diodes being available to supply different rated voltages. Resistors are connected in series to limit the current flowing under all applicable conditions, and the current that this voltage source can supply is limited too. Usually, when used as a voltage reference, the current output is quite low.


=Example=

==Reference:==

&quot;Silicon Zener Diode and Rectifier Handbook&quot;, published in 1961 by Motorola, Inc.

===page 6: Current versus voltage relationship of type 50M30Z (&lt;u&gt;50&lt;/u&gt; Watt, &lt;u&gt;30&lt;/u&gt; Volt, &lt;u&gt;Z&lt;/u&gt;ener)===

* In the forward direction, as the voltage is increased from 0, at first negligible current flows until the voltage (V) reaches about 0.75 volts. As V is increased to about 1.2, the current, if there is no external resistance,  is then already about 15 Amperes (A); even more if V is higher.

* In the reverse direction, as V is increased from 0, at first negligible current flows. Then, as the voltage reaches about 29 Volts, the current is about 5 milliamperes (mA). With the applied voltage being about 31 Volts, the current, if no series resistance is in the circuit, is about 1.5 A.

* All diodes have a rated power maximum; type 50M30Z is rated at 50 Watts (W), and Voltage ratings are listed as between 6.8 and 200 V. Characteristics vary with the temperature of the device, but some temperature-compensated types are available. Very small, temperature-compensated, listed Zener diodes for reference purposes are rated at only 400 milliwatts, with Zener voltages of 6.2 or 8.4 V (5% tolerance), for examples.

===page 177: List of 50 Watt Zener diodes===

Two of these listed Zener diodes have, for this example, a Zener knee voltage of about 30 V. They are type number 1N2823 (in TO3 package), and 1N3324 (in stud mounting package); both are otherwise equal. When about 22 Volts are applied in the reverse direction, only about 5 microAmperes can flow, but, at their nominal Zener Voltage of about 30 V, about 420 mA flows, with the maximum permitted DC Zener current (meaning the reverse-direction current a device is expected to be able to carry without damage) of these two types being 1400 mA at 75 degrees Celsius (to be derated if the temperature is higher). The resistance included in the circuit must be sufficiently high to limit the current, at any applied voltage, to that amount. The Zener voltage (at the knee) changes typically about 0.085% per degree Celsius for these two types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rectifiers''' are used to make DC out of AC. Usually equipment that uses semiconductors, such as TV sets or computers, operate on DC, yet they obtain their power from the AC socket, which is commonly found in buildings.

While the voltage supplied is usually either about 115 or 240 Volt, the equipment connected to this AC supply may use different DC voltages, and there is a need for suitable [[Electronics/Transformers|transformers]] to change the line/mains voltage to whatever is needed. This lower voltage is then fed into a set of rectifier diodes, often in the form of a &quot;rectifier bridge&quot; that consists of 4 rectifier diodes, all 4 often contained in a single plastic package with 4 connections: 2 for the applied AC voltage, and the other 2 for the + and - DC output voltage. Different rectifier ratings exist to provide a suitable range of maximum available output current. The frequency (usually 50 or 60 Hz) is important only for the transformer rating, not the rectifiers.

Normally there is a comparatively large capacitor connected across the DC terminals to &quot;smooth&quot; the DC output voltage, the capacitor's size depending on not only the acceptable maximum &quot;ripple&quot; of the DC output voltage, (AC superimposed on the DC voltage) but also on the maximum current rating of the rectifier arrangement.

=== example ===
Reference: &quot;Silicon Zener Diode and Rectifier Handbook, theory, design characteristics and applications&quot; published in 1961 by Motorola Inc.

* from page 119 &quot;The Diffused-Junction Silicon Rectifier&quot;:
The Forward Current (Amps) versus Forward Voltage (Volts) graph shows that there are slight differences depending on the rectifier's temperature, but only a very small current flows unless the voltage is at least about 0.6 V. The current is about 2 A, with no resistance in the circuit, when the voltage is about 1 V.
* Note that rectifier power ratings must not be exceeded in order to prevent damage, and any graph should also show the proper curve according to the maximum permitted current versus voltage relationship.
*from page 120: The typical static current versus reverse voltage characteristic curves, again depending on the temperature of the rectifier, show that, with a reverse voltage of about 500 V, only about 10 microamperes flow. There are one million microamperes in an Ampere. A breakdown happens if the reverse voltage is too high.

|Comment / Remark
|}

:''The next list is from [[Transwiki:Useful unix command]]. Commands should be merged into the table above, with longer explanations placed somewhere in [[Guide to Unix/Commands]]. X11 commands go in the [[Guide to X11]] book. Some of these are applications (like '''acroread'''); someone needs to find a book or place for them.''

* a2p - translation utility from awk to Perl
* &lt;nowiki&gt; a2ps - translation utility from ``any'' to Postscript &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* ac - print statistics concerning user connect time
* access - determine whether a file can be accessed
* acroread - Adobe utility for viewing pdf files
* adduser - used by root to add user to system
** usage: adduser ''userid''
* afio - utility to copy or restore files to an archive file. This utility is not part of the basic internal and external programs under Red Hat Linux. It is available as an rpm on the rpmfind.net site.
* agetty - enables login on terminals. See getty, mgetty, and uugetty.
* ali - list mail aliases
* alias - assign name to specified command list. This is actually a shell builtin. On my Red Hat system, I have global alias commands in my /etc/bashrc file and in my  /.bashrc file. On my Slackware box, I have made the rm command a little bit safer with
** alias rm='rm -i'
so that you can't recursively delete your /dev directory without telling the system you're sure you want to do it.
* alien - utility to convert to and from different Linux package formats. Can handle Debian (deb), Stampede (stp), Red Hat (rpm) and Slackware (tgz) packages.
* apropos - display command names based on keyword search
** usage: apropos ''keyword''
* apsfilter - printer filter called by lpd to deal with printing different types of files. This is a fairly sophisticated print filter. It is not set up by default in Slackware. It used to be available on the second cd of a Slackware distribution. Since 4.0, it is available as one of the main packages in the ap set. Read the mail that the installation program sends to the root user. I believe that Red Hat uses its own printer filters.
* ar - create, modify and extract from archives
* arch - print machine architecture type
* as - the portable GNU assembler
* asapm - AfterStep laptop advanced power management utility
* ash - a shell, a very simple shell program sometimes used on boot diskettes since it takes up much less space than bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.
* asload - AfterStep cpu load monitor
* asmail - AfterStep mail checking utility
* asmodem - AfterStep utility to monitor modem status
* aspell - a spell checking program along the lines of ispell
* aspostit - X Window postit note utility
* at - executes a shell script at specified time. Use atq to show pending jobs, and atrm to remove jobs from the queue.
** usage: at ''time''
** or: at -f file ''time''
* atq - shows pending jobs queued by at. If run by root, shows everybody's pending jobs.
* atrm - removes pending jobs queued by at. Use atq to determine the identities of various jobs.
** usage: atrm ''job''
* awk - searches for and process patterns in a file
* banner - print banner to standard output. Syntax is
** banner [option] [characters]
* bash - Bourne again shell. This is the default shell in the Red Hat installation.
* batch - queue, examine, or delete jobs for later execution. See at.
* bc - a language (compiler) similar to C, with unlimited precision arithmetic
* &lt;nowiki&gt; bg PID - send process with pid ``PID'' to the background. This is the same as executing &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl]z&lt;/tt&gt; while interacting with the running process. This is a shell builtin.
* bh - puts a job in the background. This is a shell builtin.
* biff - mail notification utility. Notifies user of mail arrival and sender's name.
* bind - displays or redefines key bindings. This is a shell builtin.
* bison - parser generator similar to yacc
* bru - a powerful backup utility program. Commercial. Demonstration versions are often included with Linux distributions such as Red Hat.
* bsh - equivalent to ash
* bunzip2 - used to uncompress files compressed with bzip2
* byacc - parser generator
* bzip2 - compresses with algorithm different from gzip
* bzless - view bzipped files
* c++ - invokes GNU C and C++ compiler
* cal - displays a 12-month calendar for the given year or a one-month calendar of the given month
** usage: cal ''month year''
* cat - combine, copy standard input to standard output. Used to join or display files.
* cd - change working directory. This is a shell builtin in bash, tcsh and zsh.
* cdplay - command line utility for playing audio cds
* cfdisk - similar to fdisk, but menu-driven
* chat - used to interact with a modem via a chat script
* chgrp - changes group associated with file. Can be used to change the group associated with subdirectories and files of a directory.
** usage: chgrp ''group files''
** or: chgrp -R ''group files''
* chkconfig - Query or update system services/daemons for different runlevels. Manipulates the various symbolic links in /etc/rc.d. This utility is included with many rpm-based distributions such as RedHat and Mandrake. It is designed to work with System V initialization scripts. Graphical tools for configuring system services include ntsysv, tksysv and ksysv (the latter is a KDE utility).
* chmod - set permissions (modes) of files or directories. A value of 4 is used for read permission. A value of 2 is used for write permission. A value of 1 is used for execute permission. See umask for default file permissions upon file creation. Chmod can also be used to change the suid bit on files. The syntax for the symbolic version is
** chmod [options] who operation permission file-list
The syntax for the absolute version is
** chmod [options] mode file-list
To set the uid to the owner's permissions, use
** chmod u +s file-name
To set the uid to the group's permissions, use
** chmod g +s file-name
There are lots of security issues related to allowing a program to have root's permissions when run by an ordinary user. I don't pretend to understand all of these issues.
* chown - changes ownership of a file. Can be used recursively.
** usage: chown ''userid files''
** or: chown -R ''userid files''
* chsh - change default shell
* ci - creates or records changes in an RCS file
* clear - clear screen command
* cmp - compares two files for differences
** usage: cmp ''file1 file2''
* co - retrieves an unencoded version of an RCS file
* comm - compares sorted files
* configure - automatically configures software source code
* color-xterm - color xterm program. Under Red Hat, this is just a link to xterm-color.
* control-panel - graphical system configuration tool under Red Hat.
* cp - copies on or more files. Recursive copying is one simple way of archiving part of a directory structure. Use the command as follows:
** cp -r /sourcedirectory /targetdirectory
* cpio - direct copy of files to an output device. Allows creation of archive file spanning multiple diskettes. Allows one directory structure to be mirrored elsewhere on the partition or on another partition. In order to back up an entire directory structure on diskettes, cd to the directory and use the following command:
** find . -depth -print &lt;font face=&quot;symbol&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; cpio -ov &gt; /dev/fd0
To restore from diskettes, use:
** cpio -iv &lt; /dev/fd0
The cpio command will prompt the user to insert more diskettes as they are needed. The command for mirroring a directory structure is the following:
** find . -depth -print &lt;font face=&quot;symbol&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; cpio -pv /destinationdirectory
This copies the working directory and its contents, including subdirectories, into /destinationdirectory. In order to copy an individual file which is larger than a floppy, use:
** find . -name nameoffile -print &lt;font face=&quot;symbol&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; cpio -iv &gt; /dev/fd0
* cpkgtool - Slackware tool to install, uninstall and query packages. Front end to installpkg, removepkg, makepkg. This is the graphical version that uses ncurses.
* cpp - GNU C-compatible compiler preprocessor
* crontab - schedules command to run at regularly specified time
* csh - run C shell
* csplit - separate files into sections. See also split.
* cvs - manages concurrent acces to files in a hierarchy. Stands for concurrent version system. Is built on RCS. It stores successive revisions of files efficiently and ensures that access to files by multiple developers is done in a controlled manner. Useful when many developers are working on the same project.
* cut - selects characters or TAB-separated fields from lines of input and writes them to standard output
* date - displays or sets date and time
** usage: date
** or: date ''date''
* dd - direct copy of file from one device to another. Can be used to make copies of boot or root diskettes for installing Linux. It can be used, for example, to make and exact copy of a floppy disk, as follows. First, place the diskette to be copied in the floppy drive. Then,
** dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 &gt; floppy.copy
** Replace the diskette with a fresh diskette.
** dd if=floppy.copy bs=512 of=/dev/fd0
The ibs and bs options specify the block sizes for input and for both input and output. A boot disk image can be directly copied to a floppy using the second of the two dd commands above.
* declare - declares attributes for a variable (same as typeset). This is a shell builtin.
* df - displays capacity and free capacity on different physical devices such as hard drive partitions and floppy drives that are mounted on the file system. Gives free space in blocks. With the (undocumented) option -h, the program gives free space in Mb or Gb. This is useful for those accustomed to thinking of the capacity of a high-density 3.5 inch diskette as 1440k.
* diff - displays differences between two files
** usage: diff ''file1 file2''
* diff3 - compares three files and reports on differences
* dip - used to set up a SLIP or PPP connection. It can be used to set up an outgoing SLIP connection or an incoming connection.
* diplogin - used for setting up incoming dip connections. See the man page for dip.
* dir - a variation of the GNU ls command that defaults to printing file names in columns
* dircolors - set colors for GNU ls command. In Slackware, this command is run by the /etc/profile script. Then, whenever xterm is run with the -ls (login shell) option, ls displays different colors for different types of files. Typical usage is eval `dircolors -b`. In Red Hat and Mandrake, I get color directories by aliasing the ls command (see below).
* display - set display for output of programs under X Window. Can be used to run a program on a remote machine while displaying the output on a local machine. The remote machine must have permission to send output to the local machine. This is actually an environment variable. See the more detailed discussion in connection with the xhost command below.
* dmesg - displays messages from /var/log relative to the most recent boot
* dos - invoke the DOSEMU DOS emulator
* du - displays information on disk usage. The command
** du / -bh | less
will display detailed disk usage for each subdirectory starting at root, giving files sizes in bytes.
* dumpkeys - print information about the keyboard driver's translation tables to standard output
* dvilj - send a dvi file to a Laserjet printer. There are specialized versions for individual models of Laserjet printer.
* dvilj2p - specialized version of dvilj for the IIp series of printers. See above.
* dvips - send a dvi file to a Postscript printer, to a Postscript capable Laserjet printer, or to a file (with the -o option). There is a switch to print only a subset of the pages, and another switch to print in landscape mode. Use -t landscape, which is one of the arguments to the paper type switch. If you have one page of a document that is a wide table, and you wish to print this in landscape mode, use
** dvips ''filename -pp pagenumber -t landscape''
* e2fsck - check an ext2 filesystem. The syntax is
** e2fsck ''/dev/devicename''
where the filesystem is on /dev/devicename. The device should not be mounted, and this program must be run as root.
* echo - write arguments to standard output. One use is to print out information about environment variables, as in
** echo $PATH - list paths to search
** echo $HOME or echo &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; - list name of home directory
This is a shell builtin.
* editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications. Allows the user to change X resources for individual applications.
* efax - fax program
* efix - convert between fax, text, bit-map and gray-scale formats
* egrep - search files for lines that match regular expressions. Runs faster than grep and fgrep.
* elm - an interactive mail system
* elvis - a version of the vi text editor
* emacs - screen oriented text editor
* env - desplay the current environment or set a variable equal to a new value
* eval - scans and evaluates the command line. See dircolors command. This is a shell builtin.
* ex - interactive command-based editor. The man page lists it as being the same as vim, an improved version of vi.
* exec - system call which creates a subshell to execute a binary or a script. This is a shell builtin.
* execve - a variation of the exec command.
* exit - exit a shell. This is a shell builtin.
* expand - convert tabs in files to spaces and write to standard output
* &lt;nowiki&gt; expect - a program that ``talks'' to other interactive programs according to a script. Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what the correct response should be. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* export - place the value of a variable in the calling environment (makes it global). This is a shell builtin.
* expr - utility evaluates an expression and displays the result
* f2c - FORTRAN to C translator
* f77 - FORTRAN 77 compiler
* false - null command that returns an unsuccessful exit status
* fax - simple user interface to efax and efix programs
* fc - views, edits, and executes commands for the history list. This is a shell builtin.
* fdformat - low level format of a floppy device
* fetchmail - retrieve mail from a remote mail server and pass it to local SMTP agents on the local machine
* fdisk - used to partition hard drives
** usage: fdisk ''device''
* &lt;nowiki&gt; fg PID - bring a background or stopped process with pid ``PID'' to the foreground. This is a shell builtin. If only one process is running in background mode, fg with no argument is sufficient to bring it to the foreground &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* fgrep - search for patterns in files
* file - displays classification of a file or files according to the type of data they contain
* find - find files according to a large variety of search criteria. The find command that I use the most is
** find . -name filename -print
in order to find files matching a particular name on the working directory and all subdirectories. Find can be incredibly powerful, but it is incredibly obscure.
* finger - display information about a specified userid or userids
* fmt - simple text formatting utility. Tries to make all nonblank lines nearly the same length.
* fold - break lines of specified files so they are no wider than a specified lengths
* fortune - available in the bsdgames package in Slackware and other distributions. Put a call to fortune in /etc/profile and get something inspirational or amusing every time you fire up an xterm as a login shell.
* free - gives used and free memory on system along with other useful information
* fromdos - takes a DOS text file from stdin and sends a Unix file to stdout.
* fsck - file system check and repair
* ftp - file transfer over network
* g++ - C++ compiler
* g77 - GNU Fortran 77 compiler
* gawk - GNU awk, mostly for processing delimited text files
* gcc - invoke C, C++ compiler
* getipts - parses arguments to a shell script. This is a shell builtin.
* getkeycodes - print kernel's scancode-to-keycode mapping table
* ghostscript - set of printing utilities. It seems to be obligatory to have this if a T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X installation such as teT&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X is installed. How they communicate with one another is somewhat obscure.
* ghostview - Aladdin ghostscript interpreter/previewer
* gimp - image manipulation and paint program
* glint - Red Hat graphical front end for the rpm package installer and manager.
* grep - used to find a string within a file. The -i option returns matches without regard to case. The -n option means that each line of output is preceded by file name and line number. The -v option causes non-matched lines to be printed.
** usage: grep ''pattern files''

* &lt;nowiki&gt; grub - Gnu grand unified bootloader. Can be used instead of lilo to boot multiple operating systems. I encountered a couple of snafus trying to install grub on my home machine after installing Mandrake 8.0 and choosing the lilo bootloader during the initial install. The Mandrake installation program set up /boot/vmlinuz as a symlink to the actual kernel, vmlinuz-2.4.3-20mdk. It took me a while to figure out that grub doesn't understand symbolic links. The documentation suggests installing grub on a diskette using the ``dd'' command. This refused to work, but &lt;/nowiki&gt;
** grub-install '(fd0)'
did work. The single quotes are necessary. The files necessary to run grub are normally located in /boot/grub. Once the file menu.lst has been edited and appropriated entries added to boot the different operating systems on one's hard disk(s), the following sequence of commands can be used to install grub in the master boot record (MBR) sector of the hard disk:
** root (hd0,''x'')
** setup (hd0)
Here, the ''x'' should be replaced by the partition where the /boot/grub directory is located, which is probably the root partition of the Linux system. Note that grub has its own conventions for naming devices and numbering partitions, so that for example a partition which is called hda6 under Linux will be called (hd0,5) by grub.

Ldconfig checks the header and file names of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should have their links updated. Ldconfig ignores symbolic links when scanning for libraries.
* ldd - list the shared libraries on which a given executable depends, and where they are located
* leave - display reminder at specified time
* &lt;nowiki&gt; less - Linux alternative to ``more'' command. Displays text files, one screenful at a time. When less pauses, there is a large number of available commands to tell it what to do next. One can scroll both forwards and backwards. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* let - evaluates a numeric expression. This is a shell builtin.
* lilo - installs boot loader on the boot sector of a hard drive, of a diskette, or in another location. My 486 has a hard drive that is too large for the machine's BIOS, so I have to boot from a floppy. To create a boot diskette, I do the following (as root):
** /sbin/fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
** /sbin/mkfs.ext2 /dev/fd0
** mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
** cp -dp /boot/* /mnt/floppy
** /sbin/lilo -C /etc/lilo.flop
The -C option to lilo has lilo use the lilo.flop file instead of the default lilo.conf.
* linuxconf - interactive tool for configuring Linux system. Uses X if loaded. This is a Gnome tool. It comes with my Red Hat distribution, and is not included with Slackware. It would seem to be the easiest way to configure Linux under Slackware. Version 1.15 is available for Slackware. There is a pretty good introduction to the use of linuxconf in the Red Hat 5.2 installation manual, which is available online at their web site.
* ln - creates a link to a file. Used to create hard links and, with the -s option, symbolic links which can link files on different disk partitions. The syntax is
** ln [options] source [dest]
* &lt;nowiki&gt; locate filename - find the file name which contains the string ``filename''. The syntax is easier than the find command. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* lock - temporarily lock terminal
* lockfile - create semaphore file(s), used to limit access to a file
* - log in to system

To get this all the time, add
** alias ls='ls -color=auto'
to .bashrc. The following command
** alias ls='ls -Fskb -color=auto'
will give directory listings in color, with file sizes in kilobytes, and append a character to the file to indicate its type.
* lsattr - list attributes of files in ext2 file system
* lsmod - used (by root) to show kernel modules currently loaded
* lspci - utility to display information on pci buses and hardware devices attached to them. Part of the pciutils package that comes with many Linux distributions.
* lspnp - utility to display information about pnp devices. Part of the pcmcia or kernel-pcmcia package, depending on the distribution.
* m4 - an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor. It can be used with the sendmail configuration package in Red Hat (and Slackware) to generate a sendmail.conf configuration file without having to edit the configuration file directly.
* magicfilter - general purpose printer filter. See apsfilter above. apsfilter is the printer filter that comes with the Red Hat and Slackware distributions.
* mail - sends or reads electronic mail
* make - keeps a set of programs current. This is a utility that helps when developing a set of programs. It works by executing a script called makefile, Makefile or GNUmakefile in the working directory. It is very often used in combination with configure when compiling and installing noncompiled software packages.

* nm - lists the symbols from object files objfile. If no object files are given as arguments, nm assumes `a.out'.
* nohup - runs a command that keeps running after logout. The command is in principle immune to hangups, and must have output to a non tty. According to ''Linux in a Nutshell'', this is necessary only in the Bourne shell, since modern shells preserve background processes by default.
* ntsysv - run level editor under Red Hat. This is the equivalent of tksysv, but does not require a graphical interface.
* nxterm - color xterm program. The man page for nxterm under Red Hat brings up the same page as xterm.

* pico - simple screen oriented text editor. It is included as part of the Pine program.
* ping - check if Internet computer is responding. Can also measure the time it takes the queried computer to respond.
* pkgtool - Slackware tool to install, uninstall and query packages. Front end to installpkg, removepkg, makepkg. The cpkgtool is the ncurses graphical version of this program.
* popclient - retrieve mail via the Post Office Protocol. Supports POP2 and POP3.
* popd - pops the top directory of the directory stack and uses cd to change to that directory. This is a shell builtin.
* pr - paginates files for printing
* printenv - display list of environment variables
* printtool - run (as root) in an X terminal to configure your printer(s)
* ps - displays status of processes. Use the -a option for processes for all users. Use the -x option to include processes not attached to a terminal.
* pstree - display processes in the form of a tree structure. Killing a parent process will also kill all the children and their descendants.
* pushd - pushes the argument onto the top of the directory stack and uses cd to change to that directory. This is a shell builtin.

* pwchk - checks the integrity of password and shadow files
* pwconv - converts passwords to the shadow password format
* pwunconv - unconverts passwords from the shadow password format. Generates a standard Unix password file.
* python - interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
* rcp - copy one or more files to or from remote computer. The syntax is poorly explained in the documentation that I have, including the man pages. Usage is:
** rcp filename username@remotehost:path
The user's home directory on the remote system must contain the file .rhosts with a list of users (preceded by the full domain name or exact IP address of their machine) with access privileges.
** localhostname username
* rcs - creates or changes the attributes of an RCS file. Stands for Revision Control System.
* rdev - query/set image root device, swap device, RAM disk size, or video mode in kernel
* read - reads line from standard input. This is a shell builtin.
* readonly - declares a variable to be read only. This is a shell builtin.
* reboot - in Slackware, reboots the system. Seems to be equivalent to shutdown -r now in generic Linux.
* &lt;nowiki&gt; renice program_name - resets the priority of process ``program_name''. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* reset - used to reset the screen characteristics. This is useful if the screen gets messed up from, for example, trying to display a binary file in an xterm.
* return - exits from a function. This is a shell builtin.
* rlog - prints a summary of the history of an RCS file
* rlogin - log in to remote computer. The general syntax is as follows, using the UQAM Nobel machine as an example:
** rlogin -l userid nobel.si.uqam.ca
The remote computer must recognize the local user and the local machine. See the rcp command for how to set up the .rhosts file on the remote machine.
* rm - remove files or directories. With the -r (recursive) option (very dangerous!), can be used to remove the contents of a specified directory including all subdirectories.
* rmail - interpret and handle remote mail received via uucp
* rmdir - remove empty directories
* rmmod - used to remove modular device drivers
* route -n - show routing table. The n option returns numerical addresses rather than names.
* rpm - invokes the Red Hat package manager in command line mode. I often use this command in query mode to query packages about what files they contain and to find out which package owns a particular file. Examples are
** rpm -qil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package foo.
** rpm -qfil foo. Gives package information and a file list for the package that owns the file foo. Foo must be in the working directory, or the full path to foo must be specified.
We need to find out about installing the rpm package on a Slackware box. It's probably better to use a package converter such as alien.
* rpm2tgz - an extremely useful utility on Slackware systems that converts rpm packages to tgz format. They can then be installed using the installpkg command (or pkgtool).
* rsh - execute shell command on a remote computer. See rcp and rlogin.
* rstat - summarize host's status: uptime, load averages, and current time
* ruptime - show host status of local machines
* rusers - list who is logged on local machines
* rwall - write to all users over a network
* &lt;nowiki&gt; rwho - show who is logged in on a LAN. The rwho service must be enabled for this command to run. If it isn't, run ``setup'' as root. I don't understand this last remark, which comes from ``Linux Newbie Administrator Guide''. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
* rxvt - a terminal program similar to xterm, but which has less features and uses less memory
* sed - edits a file (not interactively). Also a tool for processing text files.
* set - set or display value of shell variables. This is a shell builtin. The command
** set | less
prints the current user environment, giving the values of currently defined variables.
* setenv - set or display value of environment variables
* setserial - used by root to configure a serial port
* setterm - set terminal attributes for a virtual console
* setuid - set the id of a program when it is run. Used, for example, to give root privileges to a program run by an ordinary user. This is actually done by running the chmod program as root. See the chmod command for the syntax.
* setup - Slackware program to set up program sets and configure system. Setup devices and file systems, mount root file system
* sh - standard Unix shell. On Linux, just another name for bash.
* shift - promotes each command-line argument. This is a shell builtin.
* showmount - show information about an nfs server
* shutdown - reboot or shut down system as root, after specified amount of time. With the -r option, reboot. With the -h option, halt the system.
** usage: shutdown -r ''minutes''
* sleep - creates process that sleeps for specified interval
* sliplogin - attaches a SLIP interface to standard input. Used to allow dialin SLIP connections.
* sort - sorts and/or merge files
* split - split file into specified number of segments
* ssh - secure shell. Apparently has many of the same functionalities as rlogin, telnet, ftp, rsh, etc., with better security and encryption features. We may want to learn how to set this up and use it.
* startx - front end to xinit in Linux. This is a script which starts up X clients and shuts down the X server on exit from the window manager.
* startx &lt;tt&gt;--&lt;/tt&gt; :1 - start the next X window session on the display 1 (the default is opened on display 0). One can switch between different graphical displays using &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][F7]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[Ctrl][Alt][F8]&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.

* typeset - declares attributes for a variaable (same as declare). This is a shell builtin.
* ul - translate underscores to underlining
* umask - establishes the file-creation permissions mask. Usage is
** umask xyz
The system subtracts x, y and z from the owner, group and other file permissions that it would otherwise assign to new files. This is a shell builtin.
* umount [device] - finish writing to the device and remove it from the active filesystem. The command umount -a will (re)mount all file systems listed in /etc/fstab.
* unalias - remove name previously defined by alias. This is a shell builtin.

* workbone - console based cd player
* workman - graphical cd player program
* write - send messages to another local user
* X - the X server
* xadm - display advanced power management BIOS information
* xargs - converts standard output of one command into arguments for another. This is one of those powerful but obscure commands. Xargs reads arguments from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any initial-arguments followed by arguments read from standard input. Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.
* xbiff - graphical mail delivery notification utility
* xcalc - simple calculator program
* xclipboard - name says it all
* Xconfigurator - Red Hat utility for configuring settings for X
* xdm - used to start an X login session. This can be used to start a login session on a remote system. See the discussion on the following site:
** [http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html &lt;tt&gt;http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta/unix/xterminal/index.html&lt;/tt&gt;]
See the man pages for X, xdm, and Xserver. As usual, the man pages are pretty obscure. The best single source seems to be the Xserver man pages. After X is configured, X needs to be started at bootup with the command (in /etc/rc.d/init.d/xterm):
** X -quiet -query remotemachineaddress
If the address of a nameserver is not configured, then the numeric address of the remote machine rather than its name should be entered. If the machines are connected through ethernet cards and the net, then obviously basic networking has to be set up. Gnome and KDE come with their own versions of X display/login managers, called respectively gdm and kdm.
* xdvi - view a dvi file compiled under L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X
* xedit - a simple text editor for X
* xf86config - graphical configuration tool for X
* XF86Setup - graphical configuration tool for X
* xfd - display an available font in X. Creates a grid in an x-term with one character per rectangle.
* xfig - utility for interactive generation of figures
* xfm - graphical file manager for X
* xhost - tell X server that remote computer has access to your machine and that you will use the remote computer. This can be used to set up remote X sessions. To set up a remote X session on the UQAM Nobel machine, run the following command on the local machine (one doesn't have to be root to do this)
** xhost +nobel.si.uqam.ca
Then, log onto the remote machine using rlogin (see above) or telnet. Once logged in, use the following command to get the remote X server to open an X terminal on the local machine:
** setenv DISPLAY localhostname:0 ; xterm &amp;
This is valid for csh, which is the default login shell on Nobel. For ksh, (and I think bash) replace with
** DISPLAY=localhostname:0
** export DISPLAY ; xterm
Other X-based programs such as Netscape or Gauss (graphical version) can also be run on a remote machine with display on the local machine with little trouble. The local X server is the program that has all of the information concerning the properties of the graphics card and terminal, so it must be necessary to have X running on the local machine. The following should also work. After using xhost to give permission to the remote machine to display on the local machine, use
** netscape -display localhostname:0.0
Question: can one start the X session on the local machine and then run a remote copy of a window manager?
* xinit - start X Window. The command startx is a front end to xinit in Linux, including Slackware.

** xmodmap /etc/X11/Xmodmap.cf &amp;
into the .xession (with xdm) or the .xinitrc (with startx) file.
* xosview - displays bar graphs of system load, load average, memory usage, and swap usage

== How Industry Affected Laborers ==

During the machine age, there were a number of strikes that took place due to the demands from factories and time clocks. It was hard for individuals to adjust to that system, and as a result, they challenged the system by ignoring management's orders, skipping work, or quitting. The desire and longing for better wages led to anxiety and frustration. Like farming and mining, industry was massive in size and changed not only the nature of the work, but the person doing it. Soon, all of these disgruntled individuals formed specialized groups into unions. The different jobs varied in not only skill, but other things as well that were non-related to worker conflict; race, sex, ect. These jobs were such as working on/in railroads, steel factories, and automobiles.  The outcome for many working in labor during the Gilded Age led to horrific labor violence. Industrialists and workers literally fought over control of the workplace. Many suffered due to the strikes and riots and it inevitably led to deaths, loss of jobs, and often continuous violence. For most American workers, the Machine age had varying results. At times there was no job stability and when costs of living would increase drastically there were even more problems.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Best Practices in Water Resources Planning'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

== Overview of Planning ==

In general, planning is analysis to identify a &quot;best&quot; set of actions to attain a more desirable future for someone (some intended beneficiary).  Planning analyses vary in scope, scale and level of detail, according to:
* who is the intended beneficiary (ex: a country, a community, a business, an individual)
* what types of future conditions are desired
* what range of actions will be considered for attaining the future conditions.

== Generic Problem to be Solved ==
In general, planning analyses are initiated because someone (possibly the intended beneficiary) perceives that planning is needed.  That is, someone perceives a &quot;problem&quot; (that the future condition is not likely to meet expectations) or someone perceives an &quot;opportunity&quot; (that the future condition could be better if some actions were taken).

This delicious sour cream and onion dip will bring back memories of carefully emptying a dried soup envelope into a tub of sour cream and gently trying to push the salty mass into the center so you can stir it without choking on instant soup dust. This recipe delivers richer, fresher flavor. Eat it with potato crisps.

==Ingredients==
*&amp;frac12; medium [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (white or yellow), minced
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
*1 Instant vegetable [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cube|bouillon cube]] (enough to make 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of bouillon)
*&amp;frac14; cup water
*1 cup [[Cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] onion powder
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
In a small saucepan, sweat the onion gently with a pinch of salt and pepper until it becomes transparent. Then, increase heat and sauté until the onion becomes golden-brown and forms a sticky mass. Add the water and bouillon cube (crushed) and simmer until some of the water has evaporated and the liquid is thick. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sour cream--stir until smooth. Add the onion powder and taste. Add salt and pepper if desired. Refrigerate before serving. Makes about 1&amp;frac12; cups.

==Purpose of this text==
It has become something of a tradition that in communication theory seminars students provide some form of a &quot;brief&quot; of major theories, or an intellectual biography for a significant theorist. The Internet complicated this a bit, since many people now post these in one form or another. The approach taken here was to capture the results of a small seminar at the University at Buffalo, and make the work available to others. The hope is that this small set of chapters will encourage others to post their own versions.

Since a book is hardly a book (particularly when it comes to text books) unless there is some unified approach or schema, the assignment asked participants to pick out a theorist and use this person as an entry point into a range of theories. We would ask that those who contribute to the book read over the existing chapters and get a feel for the approach in order to provide a generalized feel throughout.


== Theoretical perspective ==
I'm wondering if this is going to be a humanities approach to communications, or an engineering approach to communications? Are you talking about the ways people communicate and the effect it has, or are you talking on the specifics of communication schemes? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:50, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

: We are coming from the perspective of the social sciences and humanities. There is considerable ambiguity in the terms used, but I think there is something of a threshing out of this, with &quot;communication theory&quot; in the engineering sense often being enveloped by &quot;Information Theory.&quot; That's the way it has (eventually) been sorted out over on Wikipedia. [[User:Halavais|Halavais]] 15:23, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

==A Good Beginning==
Not a bad start.  Make sure that Marcuse is added to the Frankfurt school.  Also, a section on modernity and communication, featuring Habermas, Harvey, et al. will bring facilitate a more complete understanding of communication situated within a historical context.  A section of conservative critique would also be benificial, featuring J.S. Mill and others on the implications of the mediocre mass that arises from a liberal-democratic model of communication. [[User:Sarkisian|Sarkisian]] 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== Naming convention ==

This book does not follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. I suggest renaming pages using slash convention. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 22:24, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks! Fixed (I think) [[User:Halavais|Halavais]] 15:23, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Structure ==

This is a great start, but I'm a bit shaky on the organizational structure.  Perhaps one of us can systematically categorize the communication theories by the traditional contexts of semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, sociopsychological, sociocultural, and critical.  I think your current approach is effective, and should remain intact; however, a supplementary chart that shows where these theories fall within the larger spectrum would also be of great help.  I recommend the helpful charts in the back of Theories of Human Communication by Littlejohn and Foss, 8th edition, as a starting point.  If I can get around to it, I will post a sample on this discussion page of what I mean.  -- --[[User:bersumm|bersumm]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Dynamic polymorphism (Overrides)====
So far, we have learned that we can add new data and functions to a class through inheritance. But what about if we want our derived class to inherit a method from the base class, but to have a different implementation for it? That is when we are talking about polymorphism, a fundamental concept in OOP programming.

As seen previously in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Paradigms|Programming Paradigms Section]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|Polymorphism]] is subdivided in two concepts ''static polymorphism'' and ''dynamic polymorphism''. This section concentrates on dynamic polymorphism, which applies in C++ when a derived class overrides a function declared in a base class.

We implement this concept redefining the method in the derived class. However, we need to have some considerations when we do this, so now we must introduce the concepts of dynamic binding, static binding and virtual methods.

Suppose that we have two classes, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; derives from &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and redefines the implementation of a method &lt;code&gt;c()&lt;/code&gt; that resides in class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. Now suppose that we have an object &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; of class &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. How should the instruction &lt;code&gt;b.c()&lt;/code&gt; be interpreted?

If &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is declared in the stack (not declared as a pointer or a reference) the compiler applies static binding, this means it interprets (at compile time) that we refer to the implementation of &lt;code&gt;c()&lt;/code&gt; that resides in &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.

However, if we declare &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; as a pointer or a reference of class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler could not know which method to call at compile time, because &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. If this is resolved at run time, the method that resides in &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; will be called. This is called dynamic binding. If this is resolved at compile time, the method that resides in A will be called. This is again, static binding.

===== Virtual member functions =====
The &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; member functions is relatively simple, but often misunderstood. The concept is an essential part of designing a class hierarchy in regards to sub-classing classes as it determines the behavior of overridden methods in certain contexts.

Virtual member functions are class member functions, that can be overridden in any class derived from the one where they were declared. The member function body is then replaced with a new set of implementation in the derived class.

{{NOTE|When overriding virtual functions you can alter the private, protected or public state access state of the member function of the derived class.}}

By placing the keyword &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; before a method declaration we are indicating that when the compiler has to decide between applying static binding or dynamic binding it will apply dynamic binding. Otherwise, static binding will be applied.

{{NOTE|While it is not required to use the virtual keyword in our subclass definitions (since if the base class function is virtual all subclass overrides of it will also be virtual) it is good style to do so when producing code for future reutilization (for use outside of the same project).}}

Again, this should be clearer with an example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
public:
  void f()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Foo::f()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
  virtual void g()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Foo::g()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
};
 
class Bar : public Foo
{
public:
  void f()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bar::f()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
  virtual void g()
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Bar::g()&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
};
 
int main()
{
  Foo foo;
  Bar bar;

  Foo *baz = &amp;bar;
  Bar *quux = &amp;bar;

  foo.f(); // &quot;Foo::f()&quot;
  foo.g(); // &quot;Foo::g()&quot;
 
  bar.f(); // &quot;Bar::f()&quot;
  bar.g(); // &quot;Bar::g()&quot;

  // So far everything we would expect...
 
  baz-&gt;f();  // &quot;Foo::f()&quot;
  baz-&gt;g();  // &quot;Bar::g()&quot;

  quux-&gt;f(); // &quot;Bar::f()&quot;
  quux-&gt;g(); // &quot;Bar::g()&quot;
 
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Our first calls to &lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;g()&lt;/tt&gt; on the two objects are straightforward. However things get interesting with our baz pointer which is a pointer to the Foo type.

&lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;/tt&gt; is not &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; and as such a call to &lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;tt&gt; will always invoke the implementation associated with the pointer type -- in this case the implementation from Foo.

{{NOTE|Remember that [[C++ Programming/Classes/Member Functions#Overloading|overloading]] and [[C++ Programming/Classes/Polymorphism|overriding]] are distinct concepts.}}

Virtual function calls are computationally more expensive than regular function calls. Virtual functions use pointer indirection, invocation and will require a few extra instructions than normal member functions. They also require that the constructor of any class/structure containing virtual functions to initialize a table of pointers to its virtual member functions. 

All this characteristics will signify a trade-off between performance and design. One should avoid preemptively declaring functions virtual without an existing structural need. Keep in mind that virtual functions that are only resolved at run-time cannot be inlined.

{{TODO|Example of issue of virtual and inline.}}

{{NOTE|Some of the needs for using virtual functions can be addressed by using a class template. This will be covered when we introduce [[C++ Programming/Templates|Templates]].}}

====== Pure virtual member function ======
There is one additional interesting possibility. Sometimes we don't want to provide an implementation of our function at all, but want to require people sub-classing our class to provide an implementation on their own. This is the case for ''pure'' virtuals.

To indicate a pure &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; function instead of an implementation we simply add an &quot;&lt;tt&gt;= 0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; after the function declaration.

Again -- an example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Widget
{
public:
   virtual void paint() = 0;
};

class Button : public Widget
{
public:
   void paint() // is virtual because it is an override
   {
       // do some stuff to draw a button
   }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Because &lt;tt&gt;paint()&lt;/tt&gt; is a pure &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; function in the Widget &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; we are required to provide an implementation in all concrete subclasses. If we don't the compiler will give us an error at build time.

This is helpful for providing interfaces -- things that we expect from all of the objects based on a certain hierarchy, but when we want to ignore the implementation details.

;So why is this useful?
Let's take our example from above where we had a pure &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; for painting. There are a lot of cases where we want to be able to do things with widgets without worrying about what kind of widget it is. Painting is an easy example.

Imagine that we have something in our application that repaints widgets when they become active. It would just work with pointers to widgets -- i.e. &lt;tt&gt;Widget *activeWidget() const&lt;/tt&gt; might be a possible function signature. So we might do something like:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Widget *w = window-&gt;activeWidget();
w-&gt;paint();
&lt;/source&gt;

We want to actually call the appropriate paint member function for the &quot;real&quot; widget type -- not &lt;tt&gt;Widget::paint()&lt;/tt&gt; (which is a &quot;pure&quot; &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; and will cause the program to crash if called using virtual dispatch). By using a &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; function we insure that the member function implementation for our subclass -- &lt;tt&gt;Button::paint()&lt;/tt&gt; in this case -- will be called.

{{TODO|Mention interface classes|C++ Programming}}

====== Covariant return types ======
Covariant return types is the ability for a virtual function in a derived class to return a pointer or reference to an instance of itself if the version of the method in the base class does so. e.g.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class base
{
public:
  virtual base* create() const;
};

class derived : public base
{
public:
  virtual derived* create() const;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This allows casting to be avoided.

{{NOTE|Some older compilers do not have support for covariant return types.  Workarounds exist for such compilers.}}

===== virtual Constructors =====
There is a hierarchy of classes with base class &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt;. Given an object &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; belonging in the hierarchy, it is desired to be able to do the following:
#Create an object &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; of the same class as &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; (say, class &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;) initialized using the default constructor of the class. The syntax normally used is:
#:&lt;tt&gt;Bar* baz = bar.create();&lt;/tt&gt;
#Create an object &lt;tt&gt;baz&lt;/tt&gt; of the same class as &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; which is a copy of &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt;. The syntax normally used is:
#:&lt;tt&gt;Bar* baz = bar.clone();&lt;/tt&gt;

In the class &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt;, the methods &lt;tt&gt;Foo::create()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Foo::clone()&lt;/tt&gt; are declared as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
    // ...

    public:
        // Virtual default constructor
        virtual Foo* create() const;

        // Virtual copy constructor
        virtual Foo* clone() const;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

If &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; is to be used as an abstract class, the functions may be made pure virtual:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo
{
   // ...

    public:
        virtual Foo* create() const = 0;
        virtual Foo* clone() const = 0;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to support the creation of a default-initialized object, and the creation of a copy object, each class &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; in the hierarchy must have public default and copy constructors. The virtual constructors of &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; are defined as follows:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Bar : ... // Bar is a descendant of Foo
{
    // ...

    public:
    // Non-virtual default constructor
    Bar ();
    // Non-virtual copy constructor
    Bar (const Bar&amp;);

    // Virtual default constructor, inline implementation
    Bar* create() const { return new Foo (); }
    // Virtual copy constructor, inline implementation
    Bar* clone() const { return new Foo (*this); }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code uses [[#Covariant return types|covariant return types]]. If your compiler doesn't support &lt;tt&gt;Bar* Bar::create()&lt;/tt&gt;, use &lt;tt&gt;Foo* Bar::create()&lt;/tt&gt; instead, and similarly for &lt;tt&gt;clone()&lt;/tt&gt;.

While using these virtual constructors, you ''must'' manually deallocate the object created by calling &lt;tt&gt;'''delete''' baz;&lt;/tt&gt;. This hassle could be avoided if a smart pointer (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) is used in the return type instead of the plain old &lt;tt&gt;Foo*&lt;/tt&gt;.

Remember that whether or not &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; uses dynamically allocated memory, you ''must'' define the destructor &lt;tt&gt;'''virtual''' ~Foo ()&lt;/tt&gt; and make it &lt;tt&gt;virtual&lt;/tt&gt; to take care of deallocation of objects using pointers to an ancestral type.

===== virtual Destructor =====
It is of special importance to remember to define a virtual destructor even if empty in any base class, since failing to do so will create problems with the default compiler generated destructor that will not be virtual.

A virtual destructor is not overridden when redefined in a derived class, the definitions to each destructor are cumulative and they start from the last derivate class toward the first base class.

====== Pure virtual Destructor ======
Every abstract class should contain the declaration of a pure virtual destructor. 

Pure virtual destructors are a special case of pure virtual functions (meant to be overridden in a derived class). They must always be defined and that definition should always be empty.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Interface {
public:
  virtual ~Interface() = 0; //declaration of a pure virtual destructor 
};

Interface::~Interface(){} //pure virtual destructor definition (should always be empty)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This Appendix contains the top 30 questions people ask when using Mac hardware and software. It's a good idea to read through this section before you use your Mac, as it will clarify some of the things you are likely to need answers to at first.

=The Questions=
==I don't like the Apple mouse.  How can I use my own mouse with my Mac?==
If you'd prefer to use a non-Apple mouse, as many Mac users do, Apple is happy to accommodate you. Simply plug your mouse into your Mac and it will be automatically recognized, multiple buttons, scroll wheel, and all. You can use a PS/2 mouse with a PS/2 to USB adapter. Some mice require special software to work properly.

==How do I right-click?==
You can perform the equivalent of right-clicking in OS X by either holding down the mouse button, or by pressing Ctrl and clicking at the same time. If you have a Mighty Mouse (the mouse that ships with all modern Macs) you can also configure this for right clicking. Have a look in &quot;Keyboard &amp; Mouse&quot; under System Preferences. Also, if you have a laptop Mac, you can do a right-click by clicking the touchpad with two fingers while properly configured.

==How does my CD/DVD Drive Work?==
Apple often uses slot loading optical drives that aren't commonly used by other computer makers. The way of interacting with the drives is also different from most others. If your drive looks like a thin slot, insert a disc and push it into the computer. The drive will catch onto the disc and read it. To eject the disc, press and hold the Eject key in the upper right-hand corner of your keyboard for a second.

{{Info|'''TIP:''' If a slot-load drive misbehaves and refuses to eject a disc, it means that the disc didn't lodge correctly inside and is assumed to not be in at all. The fix is to shut down (not restart) your computer. Then turn it on while holding down the left/only mouse button. This is your way of telling the drive, &quot;You ate my disc!&quot;, and it will attempt to spit it out.}}

If your drive is of the tray variety, press and hold your Eject key, or F12 on some keyboards, to open and close it. There is also an eject button next to the tray drives on some Macs, but this only works when a disc is already in the drive.
If you are using a non-Apple or old Apple keyboard, you don't have an eject key. Right-click the disc's icon and choose &quot;Eject&quot; instead.

==A Program has crashed and won't quit! What do I do?==
Forcing an application to quit is called &quot;Force Quitting&quot; it. To do this, press ⌘⌥⎋ (Apple/Command-Option-Escape), choose the name of the crashed application from the list, and click the pulsating blue &quot;Force Quit&quot; button.

==How do I empty the Trash?==
The simplest way is to choose &quot;Empty Trash&quot; from the Finder menu (shortcut: ⇧⌘⌫). The Finder must be the frontmost application for this menu to appear in the menu bar. You can also press and hold the trash icon, and a menu will appear with an &quot;Empty Trash&quot; option.

==Why can't I cut files using Finder?==
If you were a Windows user you may wonder why OS X doesn't allow you to &quot;cut&quot; files and then paste them somewhere else in Finder. Apple has chosen to disable this feature for various reasons. The easiest alternative is to move the file(s) by dragging and dropping using the &quot;spring-loaded folders&quot; feature.  

==Where can I get support?==
There are many resources available where you may seek help. First, basic questions may be answered in your Mac's, or an application's help files. New computers come with 90 days of telephone support and one year of limited parts coverage. AppleCare extends that coverage to 3 years of telephone support and parts coverage. There are also numerous communities that will assist you with your Mac (usually in the form of forums), including Apple's very own &quot;Discussions&quot; area of the support section on their site. More resources can be found on Apple's support site, or third party documentation, which can usually be found through search engines. You may also receive free support at any one of Apple's Genius bars (with appointment). Some technicians may also be able to assist you, at a price. 

==How do I select multiple items on some web forms?==
Under Windows, you may be used to holding down the &quot;shift&quot; or &quot;control&quot; keys to select multiple items.  In Mac OS X, use the Command key instead of Control to select items that aren't next to each other.  Holding Shift allows you to select a number of items that are all together.  The Control key is normally used to display a contextual menu when using a single-button mouse.  If you have a two button mouse, you can right-click to achieve the same thing.
[[Category:Mac OS X Tiger]]

==Where can I find a program for...==
Finding software for Macs can be hard at times since it's not used as much as Windows in many contexts. Fortunately there are sites like [http://www.versiontracker.com versiontracker.com] and [http://www.macupdate.com macupdate.com] which have databases of the newest versions of most OS X software. Another good resource is [http://macintoshsoftware.net MacintoshSoftware.net] . If you can't find the software you need there, ask on a forum.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The football field may differ slightly from place to place, but all football fields have some things in common. One of the first things one notices about a football field is that it has a 100-yard middle capped off by 10-yard end zones. These end zones are distinguished by markings on the field. Also, the field is surrounded by a giant white line. At the side of the field, this line forms the sideline of the field. There are fine white markings down the middle of the field. These are hash marks, which the ball is always placed between before it is snapped, and the spacing depends on what type of football is being played. The thick white lines running the width of the field are yard lines, which aid in the determination of the ball's position. Above each end zone is a crossbar.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The offense is the bread and butter of a team's scoring, so naturally, it is the most exciting part of the game. The offensive unit consists of five offensive linemen and six &quot;skilled&quot; players. One of the skilled players is usually the quarterback, who initiates offensive plays and is the offense's focal point. The other skilled players may be running backs, who are either halfbacks or fullbacks, wide receivers, and tight ends. Each player's job in a play depends on what kind of play it is, but mainly, it depends on whether it is a running or a passing play.

The offensive lineman's job is simple, and it leads to their sheer size on the field. A lineman's size should not be underappreciated because being squashed by one of these guys can be quite painful and is not good for your health in the long term. They are required to keep defensive linemen and linebackers away from the running back and quarterback. They do this by simple blocking, but some linemen will &quot;pancake&quot; a defender, which means that the defender is pushed to the ground. If a defender is pancaked, the defense is essentially short by one man. A lineman does not want a defensive player to push past him, but this happens on almost every play.

No discussion of the offense is complete without mentioning the quarterback's duties. He calls for the ball to be snapped from the center to initiate the play. On a running play, the quarterback does not do much other than hand the ball off. On a passing play, however, the quarterback gets to shine. He must throw the ball to an open receiver before the defense gets to him. The position of quarterback is arguably the most demanding position in football.

The position of running back requires a good deal of bravery. One of the running back's jobs is obvious from the name; he runs with the ball, hoping to gain good yardage and possibly a touchdown. Another job is blocking, and the fullback, who is generally bigger than the halfback, does this often. A halfback on a team with a strong passing game can expect to block a lot, though. The running backs can also catch passes. This can create mismatches for the defense.

The wide receiver is the main passing threat on offense. He is normally one of the smallest and fastest men on the field. They are required to catch passes from the quarterback (and, occasionally, the halfback). When a team looks for big yardage, the wide receiver is normally who it turns to. The wide receivers don't play a big role in running plays; they generally lead cornerbacks and safeties upfield so the running back can cover more ground.

Although every skilled position seems to call for multiple offensive talents, the tight end has the most split job after the quarterback. On some plays, they act just like offensive linemen and block defenders. On other plays, particularly near the opponent's goal line, they can catch passes. This makes them dangerous on the field.</text>

== 1. Describe the function of the following tools: ==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Bandsaw at Lowes.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Bandsaw&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Belt_sander_bosch.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Belt Sander&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Decoupeerzaag.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Jig Saw&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Miter saw.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Miter Saw&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Radial_arm_saw_osha.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Radial Arm Saw&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Wood_router_jmc_2005_03_12.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Router&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Shaper_osha.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Shaper&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Band Saw ===
A '''band saw''' is a saw that can be used for woodworking, metal working, and a variety of other materials. It gets its name from its blade, consisting of a narrow band of toothed metal. This band rides on two large wheels stacked vertically with a space between them. Band saws are particularly useful for cutting irregular shapes. The radius of a curve that can be cut on a particular saw is determined by the width of the band.

=== Belt Sander ===
A belt sander is a machine used to quickly sand down wood and other materials for finishing purposes. It consists of a motor that turns a pair of drums on which a seamless loop of sandpaper is mounted. Belt sanders can be either hand-held, where the sander is moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the sanding belt. Stationary belt sanders are often combined with a disc sander.

Belt sanders can have a very aggressive action on wood and are normally used only for the beginning stages of the sanding process, or used to rapidly remove material.
=== Jig Saw ===
A jigsaw (also called saber saw or saber saw) is a type of saw used for cutting arbitrary curves, such as stenciled designs or other custom shapes, into a piece of wood or similar material. It is usually used in a more artistic fashion than other saws, which only cut in straight lines and exist mainly to chop pieces of wood to length for building structure. The first jigsaw puzzles were made using this kind of saw.

Traditional jigsaws are hand saws, consisting of a handle attached to a small, thin blade. More modern jigsaws are power tools, made up of a motor and a reciprocating saw blade.

=== Miter Saw ===
Today, a miter saw (also called a chop saw or drop saw) usually refers to a power tool used to make a quick, accurate crosscut in a workpiece. It is most frequently used to cut wood, although some plastics and light metals can also be cut with the tool. Common uses include framing operations and the cutting molding. Most miter saws are relatively small and portable, with common blade sizes ranging from eight to 12 inches.

The miter saw makes cuts by pulling a spinning circular saw blade down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise cutting angle between the blade and the longest workpiece edge. In standard position, this angle is fixed at 90°.

=== Radial Arm Saw ===
A radial arm saw is a machine intended for cutting materials to length. It is primarily a woodworking machine, although it is sometimes used for cutting metals, such as angle iron or aluminum extrusions. Before the advent of the radial arm saw, table saws and hand saws were most commonly used for crosscutting lumber. Table saws are ideal for ripping stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a table saw blade. When a radial arm saw is used, the stock remains stationary on the saw's table and the blade is pulled through the stock.

=== Router ===
A router is a woodworking tool used to route out (hollow out) an area in the face of a piece of wood. It was a tool particularly used by pattern makers and consisted of a broad-based wooden hand plane with a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate. Since about 1960, it has been replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Further refinement has produced the even more recent plunging spindle router, which is even better adapted for many types of work.

=== Shaper ===
A wood shaper is a stationary woodworking machine in which a spindle spins at moderately high speeds. Specially shaped bits are mounted on the spindle. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the bit cuts a profile into it. On some shapers, router bits can also be used using a special mounting adapter.

Wood shapers do essentially the same job as the router table, with the main difference being that a wood shaper is a stationary machine designed for larger volume work while a router table is a hand tool for lighter duty work. Routers can also be mounted on a router table, and used as a stationary tool. However, routers run at considerably higher speeds than shapers, and the use of large bits can be dangerous. Also, shapers can be used to cut much larger profiles than routers and custom-made shaper bits can be readily ordered or fabricated.

== 2. Demonstrate how to use the following tools: ==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Block_plane.jpg|Block Plane
Image:Circ_saw.jpg|Circular Saw
Image:Framing_square.jpg|Framing Square
Image:Hammer2.jpg|Hammer
Image:Crosscut_saw.JPG|Hand saw
Image:Water_level_1.jpg|Level

Image:Chasse_clou.png|Nail Set
Image:Plumb_bob.jpg|Plumb Bob
Image:Chisel_wood_24mm.jpg|Wood Chisel
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Block Plane ===
A block plane is designed to cut end grain and is typically small enough to be used with one hand.  To use it, securely clamp the piece to be planed to a solid object (ideally, a work bench).  Then pass the plane's sole across the endgrain you are trying to smooth.  The blade can be adjusted, and it is best to set it such that the blade barely protrudes out of the bottom of the plane.  Adjust it so that it takes very thin shavings.  If no wood is removed, let the blade out a little more.

=== Circular Saw (cut a straight line) ===
'''Note: Participants must be at least 16 years old to use power tools'''
It is vitally important that you describe the dangers involved in using a circular saw before you turn your Pathfinders loose on one.  It is very easy to cut off a finger or cause an even more serious injury with one of these.  If your Pathfinders are a little scared (not petrified) of this tool, that's a good thing.  One should ''never'' get too comfortable with dangerous equipment.

Make sure the lumber is well supported before attempting to cut it, and make sure that you closely supervise the use of this tool.  The operator should also wear eye protection.

Adjust the blade so that the depth of cut just exceeds the thickness of the board you wish to cut.  You can run the blade right over the top of a saw horse this way.  This will cut a small groove in the sawhorse, but that's an acceptable use of the tool.

If cutting plywood, you can clamp a piece of lumber along the line so that the shoe of the saw can rest against it and use it as a guide.  Make sure the saw can clear the clamps on ''both'' ends of the cut though.  Also make sure that the operator doesn't have to overreach to complete the cut and that all hands, feet, limbs, small children, and pets are clear of the area.

=== Framing Square ===
A framing square is used to make sure that an angle is 90°.  Place the corner of the square next to the angle you wish to check, and adjust the angle until it lines up with the square.  To check that the square itself is square, mark a straight line and place one edge of the square along this line.  Then mark another line along the other edge of the square, intersecting the first line near the center of its length.  Finally flip the square and see if the other side of the first line and the second line form also a 90° angle.

=== Hammer ===
Grip the hammer near the end of the handle opposite the hammer's head.  Many people grip the handle near the hammer's head, but this is incorrect.  When driving a nail, the hammer must be maneuvered so that its flat face strikes the nail's head at a right angle to the nail's axis, with the head moving parallel to that axis. Failure to achieve either condition will result in a sideways force on the nail's head, that may bend it. Also, one should relax the muscles of the hand and arm momentarily when the hammer strikes.

=== Hand Saw (cut a straight line) ===
Handsaws are tools used for cutting wood. Handsaws come in many varieties, including the crosscut saw, rip saw, coping saw, tenon saw, backsaw, and dovetail saw. Each has its own special use. A crosscut saw is used for cutting across the grain of a piece of lumber. A rip saw is used for cutting along the grain. A coping saw is used for making curved cuts. A tenon saw is used for cutting tenons and other fine work. A backsaw is commonly used with a miter box and for small cutting jobs. A dovetail saw is used for cutting dovetail joints.

To use a crosscut or a rip saw, place the board on a supported surface at thigh-height (between the knee and hips). Grip the saw with the right hand (assuming right-handedness) and use the left knee to hold the board in place. Align the right shoulder, arm, and hand so that they are in line with the cut to be made. Begin with light strokes, noting that the saw cuts on the push stroke. As the cut progresses, keep an eye on the line, pulling the blade toward it. If this is to be a &quot;finished&quot; cut, you can score a &quot;V&quot; along the line first with a carton knife, and let the blade ride in the V groove. Score another line along the bottom of the board to prevent tear-out.

Maintain your saws by keeping them dry and sharp. Many tools (including saws) can be kept in great condition by wiping them down with a cloth and oil (or WD40) after each use.

=== Level ===
A level is a tool designed to indicate whether a surface is level or plumb.  A level surface has no tilt to it, so that liquid would pool up on the surface rather than run off.  A plumb surface is straight up and down.  Ideally, you want your floors to be level and your walls to be plumb.

Most levels have two bubbles on them - one for checking levelness, and the other for checking plumbness.  To use the level, lay its edge on the surface you wish the check.  Embedded in the middle of the level is a small window where the bubble and the tube is mounted. Two rings designate where the bubble would be if the surface were level (or plumb).  If the bubble is not centered between these two rings, the surface is not level.  Lift one edge of the level off the surface to see how far you have to move it in order to move the bubble between the lines.  This will give you an indicator of how much correction is required to make the surface level.  Adjust and remeasure, repeating until the surface is level.

=== Measuring Tape ===
[[image:Ruler_sixteenths.png|left|80px]]
A measuring tape is more commonly known as a &quot;tape measure.&quot;  It is used for measuring the length of an item.  There is a metal tape curled into a spiral inside the enclosure, and attached to a spring.  When the tape is pulled out of the enclosure, the spiral unwinds and the spring is tensed.  When the tape is released, the spring draws it back into the enclosure.  A hook on the end of the tape prevents it from being completely drawn inside, and this hook can also be used for hooking the end of the tape to the edge of a board.  The tape itself is marked with inches, and these can be read off to measure a board or to mark a line for a cut.  Between each inch mark are smaller tick marks.  The largest of these is halfway between each inch marking, and indicates the half-inch measure.  Slightly smaller tick marks lie between the half-inch mark and the inch marks, and these mark off the quarter-inch increments.  Between each of the quarter inch marks are smaller marks to indicate eighths.  Some tapes also mark off sixteenths (sometimes only for the first several inches).  See the illustration to see how to read the markings.

Most tape measures also show 1 foot increments (often with a black square) as well as showing 16-inch increments (often with a red square).  The 16-inch increments are useful because studs, joists, and rafters are commonly 16 inches apart.

=== Nail Set ===
A nail set is used in finish carpentry to drive a nail below the surface of a board.  First the nail is driven with a hammer until it is very near the surface of the board.  Then the tip of the nail set is placed on the nail head.  Finish nails have a small divot in the head to accept the nail set.  The head of the nail set is then struck with the hammer until the nail is driven below (or flush with) the surface of the board.

=== Plumb Bob ===
A plumb bob is a weight on the end of a string.  The weight will hang straight down and is used as a reference for a perfectly vertical line.  It can be used in some places where a level cannot - such as in a place where there is no vertical surface to place the level against.  For example, a carpenter may wish to find a place on the floor just below a point on a ceiling joist so he can construct an interior non-weight bearing wall there and then be able to tie it into the ceiling joist.  In this case, the wall does not yet exist, so there is nothing to place a level against to measure for plumbness.

=== Wood Chisel ===
Wood chisels are most commonly used in carpentry for installing recessed hinges.  To do this, the hinge is laid on the board to which it will be attached, and then it is traced.  The hinge is then removed, and a sharp knife is used to score around the hinge's outline.  A chisel is then used to remove wood to a depth equal to the hinge's thickness.

== 3. Describe the use of and distinguish between the following types of nails: 20 Penny, 16 Penny, 12 Penny, 8 Penny, 6 Penny, Finish, Brad, Roofing, Screw Nail, Sinker, Common, and Galvenized ==

;Penny: The '''penny''' size is written with a number and the abbreviation d for penny (e.g. - 10d). D is an abbreviation for denarius, a Roman coin similar to a penny; this was the abbreviation for a penny in the UK before decimaliation. A smaller number indicates a shorter nail and a larger number indicates a longer nail. Nails under 1-1/4 in., often called brads, are sold mostly in small packages with only a length designation (e.g. 1/2&quot; (12 mm), 1-1/8&quot; (28 mm), etc.).

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;4&quot;
|- 
|6d 
| 2&quot; (~50 mm)
|-
| 8d 
| 2-1/2&quot; (~65 mm)
|-

|-
| 16d 
| 3-1/2&quot; (~90 mm)

| 20d 
| 4&quot; (~100 mm)
|}

;Finish nail: A '''finish nail''' is used for interior woodworking.  Size varies, but the head of the nail is only slightly larger than the nail's shaft.  A finish nail is ''set'' by driving its head below the surface of the wood using a ''nail set''.  The head can then be covered with putty (for a natural finish) or with caulk (for a painted finish).  If done well, this makes the nail effectively invisible.

;Brad: '''Brad''' nails are small and often made of brass.  They are often used to hold small pieces of trim in place.  Rather than attempting to hide the nail, brads sometimes have decorative heads, so that the nail head becomes part of the decor.

;Roofing nail: A '''roofing nail''' is short with a large, flat head.  It is also coated with zinc to prevent rusting.  Roofing nails are used for attaching shingles to a roof.

;Screw nail: A '''screw nail''' has a twisted shank for extra holding power.

;Sinker: A '''Sinker''' nail's head is tapered on the underside, so that the nail can be driven flush with the surface of the board.  These are used in general construction.

;Common: A '''Common''' nail has a flat head and is used for general construction, carpentry, and framing.

;Galvanized: A '''Galvanized''' nail is a nail that has been coated with zinc to inhibit corrosion.  Galvanized nails are often used in work that will be exposed to weather.

== 4. Assist in erecting a building not less than 6x8 feet in ground dimensions with a gable roof and at least one door and one window, demonstrating ability to measure and use tools from requirement 2. ==
This requirement is just ''begging'' you to build a shed, though other options are certainly possible as well.  Many Pathfinders go on mission trips to help build churches or schools, and if your group is planning to do this, you have the perfect opportunity to earn this honor.

In the United States (and in most developed countries) the local government will require a building permit for a shed, even one as small as this.  Check with the local government and review the building codes before starting this project.  They will usually want a drawing showing what you plan to build before issuing a permit.

If building a small shed, you may be able to use a &quot;floating&quot; foundation - that is special concrete blocks in the shape of a trapezoid (wider at the base than on top).  The blocks sit on the ground, and beams are placed in notches on top of these.  The floor joists and headers (which join to the end of the joists) are built on top of the beams.  Once the floor is built, the walls can be framed (including openings for the doors and windows).  At this point, the walls can be sheathed and the roof can be framed, sheathed, and shingled as well.  Then the doors and windows are installed, the siding is put on, and the finish carpentry begins on the inside (though this step can be skipped on a shed).

Be sure that your Pathfinders each use all the tools called out in requirement 2.  It might be a good idea to make a checklist for each Pathfinder, and have them compare their activities to it as the day progresses to be sure they use all the tools required.

== 5. When building the above project, use all of these features: ==
[[Image:Carpentry_construction_details.png|thumb|500px|right|1:cap plate, 2:top plate, 3:cripple stud, 4:header, 5:stud, 6:shoe plate, 7:jack stud, 8:subfloor, 9:joist.]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;
=== Floor Joist ===
A floor joist is a board that supports the floor.  Depending on how large an area the floor covers, and how far the joists span, the floor joist can be anywhere from a 2x6 to a 2x12, or even bigger.  Floor joists are installed edgewise, and they are attached to headers which attach to the foundation of the building.

=== Sub Floor ===
The sub floor is usually made from plywood, particle board, or oriented strand board (OSB), and is nailed (or screwed) to the floor joists.  The finished floor (carpeting, hardwood floor, laminate floor, linoleum, vinyl, tile, etc.) is then laid atop the sub floor.

=== Shoe Plate ===
More commonly known as a bottom plate or a sole plate, a shoe plate is the bottom board in a framed wall.  Studs are nailed into this board, and it is nailed to the floor.  Some local building codes require that the shoe plate be made of pressure treated lumber to resist rot if water pools on the floor (for whatever reason).

=== Top Plate ===
The top plate is the board running along the top of a framed wall.  Like the shoe plate, the studs are nailed to this board, and it is attached to the ceiling.

=== Double Plate ===
For added strength, two top plates are used, most commonly on a weight-bearing wall.  The upper top plate is called the cap plate.

=== Conventional Roof or Trusses ===
A ''conventional roof'' is made from rafters which are beams that run from the roof's ridge to the ceiling joists.  A ''truss'' is an engineered, pre-built structure consisting of triangles.  Trusses are lighter, stronger, and cheaper than rafters, but they form a web of lumber inside the roof rendering the attic space unusable.  Rafters are positioned in line with the studs in a wall and are fastened to both the top plate and the ceiling joists.  A pair of rafters (joined to the opposite sides of the ridge board) are sometimes tied together with a collar beam which is a horizontal member.

=== Felt Roof ===
Felt roofing material is not like the felt sets used in the children's Sabbath School classes.  Rather, &quot;felt roofing&quot; is just another name for tar paper.  Before installing the felt roofing, you should first nail a drip strip to the edges of the roof.  Then the felt paper is rolled out over the entire horizontal length of the roof (not top to bottom!) and stapled onto the sheathing.  If the felt is not wide enough to cover the roof from the eaves to the peak, you will need another layer.  The first layer should be along the eaves, and subsequent layers should overlap previous ones by a couple of inches.  If the roof has a ridge vent, do '''not''' cover it.  The purpose if a ridge vent is to allow heat to escape from the attic.  Covering it with tar paper defeats this feature completely.  The roof is now ready to shingle.

=== Shingles ===
Shingles are laid on top of the felt roofing, starting with the bottom row.  Use roofing nails to attach asphalt shingles directly to the felt roofing.  The next row of shingles should be offset from the first so that the boundary between two shingles and the notches that make up the tabs in one shingle are completely covered by the tab of another - not by another boundary or by a notch.  The shingles should overlap such that only the tabs show, and not the solid portion on the upper part of the shingle.  It helps tremendously to mark parallel lines on the tar paper with a chalk line so that the shingles do not creep uphill.  You want the line to be level.

=== Window with Weight-bearing Header ===
A window opening must have a weight-bearing header.  The header is a pair of 2x4's which are turned on their edges and nailed to a stud.  A pair of studs (called ''jack studs'') run from the bottom of the header to the floor to help support the weight.  Short studs (called ''cripple studs'' then run from the header to the top plate.  The cripple studs supply a support for the wall's sheeting.

=== Door with Weight-bearing Header ===
As with windows, doors also require a weight-bearing header.  It is built exactly the same way a window opening is made.
=== Fascia on Eaves ===
Fascia is a &quot;finish&quot; board that covers the ends of the rafters.

=== Siding ===
The purpose of siding is to keep water out of the building.  Vinyl siding is, in general, easier to work with than aluminum siding, but there are other options too, including asphalt, weather boards, and plain old plywood with felt paper beneath and with furring strips covering the joints. It's always good to consult with different websites, when you need to install new siding in order to find out how much of it you will need for your project.

==Note==
Participants must be 16 years old or older to use power tools.

The latest bulletin is a year old.  Perhaps this page should be discontinued?  At least it should not be linked from the main wikibooks page [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 04:52, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:There are a number of &quot;current news&quot; items that could potentially go up here, but for somebody willing to volunteer to keep this page up to date.  Indeed, Wikibooks has been in the news quite a bit lately from a number of different places.  In particular, the French newspaper '''Liberation''' just did a [http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=332875 major article] on Wikijunior and Wikibooks.... surprisingly talking quite a bit about the English Wikibooks in addition to the French port of the project.  The numbers are a little off because they claim a total of 12,000 titles, when in fact that is the module count.  Title count on Wikibooks is in the range of a few hundred, but it is still impressive when you think about it.

:Ideally, this should be updated.  For now, this is historical information about the origins of Wikibooks and some early press coverage.  I don't see a reason to delete this page, but perhaps a disclaimer that this is heavily out of date and that we need a volunteer to add updated news regarding Wikibooks.  The 10,000th Wikibook module went by with little fanfare except for a brief mention at meta and the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].  As far as linking from the main page is concerned, I don't see too much problem with that but perhaps it could be moved to the Community Portal page instead?  That is another page which is in dire need of updating as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:03, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Are there any good places within the community to get some news (e.g. the 10,000 module).  Like is the Mailing list a good place?
::Also is this page not better named as &quot;News&quot; then?  I thought it would be a kind of forum [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 13:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
:::I personally wouldn't object to this page being renamed &quot;news&quot; instead of Bulletin Board.  Wikipedia has a &quot;news&quot; section, and Quarto is the overall Wikimedia &quot;news&quot; publication (and of course there is Wikinews for general news as well).  We just havn't been too organized in this regard.  Surprisingly, Google News is perhaps the best bet right now to find out what people outside of this project are saying about us.  The mailing list is a joke and mainly a bunch of early contributors to Wikibooks.  It is, however, a good way to get quick communication to the Wikimedia Foundation board regarding Wikibooks activities.  [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] is a much better forum for general communications within Wikibooks, but even that doesn't always get monitored.  Better than most places, however.  If you are willing to &quot;volunteer&quot; and turn this into a general news area about current happenings with Wikibooks, I would like to encourage you to do that.  Some exciting things are happening with Wikibooks, and it would be nice to be able to point out major accomplishments when they occur.  I just don't have the time to do all the organization I know it will take to rework this page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)


::: Without promising too much I will try and make the page a little more current, and perhaps even rename it when I figure how to.  I have high hopes for wikibooks and do not like seeing it look like it is dormant.  [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:41, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::::Thanks for the effort so far.  You are correct, we need to keep pages like this fresh.  One of the problems with Wikibooks is that most contributors here tend to hunker down and work on their little pet Wikibook, which takes quite a bit of time to flesh out.  In contrast, Wikipedia can typically get a major article completed quickly, not only because those articles are shorter but there are usually more contributors willing to help.  After adding a half dozen articles, many people are willing to branch out and work on &quot;website infrastructure&quot; like links between pages and content organization.  The process of doing that here on Wikibooks, like just about everything else, tends to take quite a bit longer to happen.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== Dead? ==

Does any one watch this page? I posted some practical news here and don't even know if anyone reads them...

Tip for everyone: you can post here '''everything''' that has project-wide meaning: request for adminship, new CSS class, change in important template etc. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:39, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

:I'm watching this page... mainly for vandalism.  Still, it would be nice to add a little bit more &quot;news&quot;.  I don't have the time to keep this current, but it would be nice to make some project-wide happenings put here as a brief note of what is going on.  It looks like more is happening off the Staff Lounge page more and more, so this might become a useful place to keep a quick eye on what is happening on Wikibooks before you discover that decisions have been made without you.  The community portal page needs similar work.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:27, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

::We've been trying hard to resurrect this page, and hopefully people will be adding more news to it as time goes on. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:::How does this page differ from other pages like the Staff Room, Admins' Noticeboard, etc.?  I'm watching this page also but I don't know why.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:58, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: Staff Lounge is an active discussion forum. Bulletin board is more of a 1-line or 2-line summary of an important event. I didn't know this page existed for a while, but now I watch it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::Xania probably doesnt need to watch it, because he's already involved in all the discussions. The bulletin board is just a place to share news to users, and if you already know all the news, you don't need to watch it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:15, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::::::I was going to ask 'but how do people find this page?' but then I noticed that it's linked from the sidebar.  Maybe it should be called 'Wikibooks News' or something that calls out for people to read it.  'Bulletin board' just suggests it's some kind of forum and so won't be visited by many users. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::::::Perhaps we should rename the link to be &quot;Bulletin board|Wikibooks News&quot;, or something like that, but I dont think we should rename this page entirely. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== RSS feed ==

It'd be really nice to have an RSS feed for this. We could easily have a RC bot check for additions to the project page and upload data to be added to an existing rss and atom file. I could create the php backend, except that I know little about protecting the files from hijackers, so probably not. I doubt the rcbot would be too difficult to create. Who has an always-on server (at their home, I assume) they're willing to host it on? Since it would only be text, anyone one of the major editors getting a free hosting service would probably be sufficient. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:I don't currently an always-on server, but I have been planning to create one sometime soon. I have a server machine (PII, Redhat linux, Apache), but it isn't connected. What I need to do is boot up my server, update all the old software, register a domain name, and set up some bot software to run on it. But you are right, some kind of feed for the bulletin board would be nice. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Mediawiki has an RSS feed for every page. Go to &quot;history&quot; and it appears in toolbox. The one for this (talk) page is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Bulletin_board&amp;action=history&amp;feed=rss here]... lol. The one for this page itself is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Bulletin_board&amp;action=history&amp;feed=rss here] --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Regardless, I dont think this page changes nearly enough to warrant a different RSS feed. It would be a very boring feed indeed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

==Creation of a math formulas page==
I think that it would be a great asset for anyone in the math field if there was a site where a majority of the formulas could be found. This was suggested by the people at wikipedia.      from: trd89 @ wikipedia March 2, 2007
: Isn't that already the function of [[w:Table of integrals]], [[w:Table of derivatives]], et. al.? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:16, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

::The [[Calculus]] book contains a few pages with such lists, and there is another similar work at [[Engineering Tables]], which serves as a shared &quot;appendix&quot; for a number of other books on the engineering bookshelf. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

== Needed? ==

The old discussion is being reincarnated.  Is this page really necessary?  Yes, I visit it and it's on my watch list but is it really necessary?  There are so many pages for general discussion - assistance, Bulletin Board, Technical, General discussion, Project discussion, etc.  Given that this is a small wiki do we need so many?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:56, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

Also given what I've just said, was it wise for me to even bother posting my comment here?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:56, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

:It's on my WL too, but I don't think anyone ever comes here (well... how would I know?)  It's certainly not serving its intended purpose, and as you note, other pages seem to be filling that role just fine. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:55, 5 November 2009 (UTC)

:News postings ought to have a place on the main page, if anywhere, for visibility, but there's not enough involvement to discuss redesigning it.  We're still doing better than [[v:Wikiversity:News|Wikiversity:News]], but there's not enough activity to justify this page.  If not deleted entirely, I suggest that this page and [[User:WikimediaNotifier/notifications]] be removed from [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Navigation]] and this page be removed from the navigation at left, to put the focus on pages that more of the community is actively watching, if not actively involved in.  This page in particular is the first link in the navigation under the community heading and creates the terrible impression that this wiki is dead. 

:For that matter, [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks in the media]] linked from the unimpressive [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] hasn't been updated since 2007 either.  Let's clean up the cobwebs and get rid of these. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:52, 17 November 2009 (UTC)

: This isn't intended to be a discussion page, rather news about Wikibooks that Wikibookians consider to be of importance so that people who have been gone awhile have a place to turn to learn what importance things have happened. This includes things like when a proposal becomes a policy, if new extensions become enabled, etc. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:20, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

::I'm putting the indexes on the reading room root instead.  This page can go back to being stagnant. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:29, 24 November 2009 (UTC)

== starting a new book ==

ok, how do i do it?[[User:Ldecola|Ldecola]] ([[User talk:Ldecola|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ldecola|contribs]]) 22:50, 23 November 2011 (UTC)

:See if something already exists and if not start a new page in the Wikibooks main namespace. For instance [[MyBook]] (you can also use your userspace for drafting your concept first and then move the page).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:26, 23 November 2011 (UTC)
:Chazz has also replied to the question of your talk page and I have posted the welcome information that may be relevant for you.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:29, 23 November 2011 (UTC)

== RfC notice ==

Thanks to Uncle G for [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Bulletin_Board&amp;diff=2370660&amp;oldid=2312939 informing] people about the Internet Defense League RfC. Just a quick remark that it is not true that &quot;Unfortunately, the Foundation representatives only directly notified that part of the community that is on the English Wikipedia&quot; - this was [http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/282112 posted] on Wikimedia-l (formerly Foundation-l), quite the usual venue for such issues, and [[m:Wikimedia_Forum#RfC_on_the_Internet_Defense_League|on the &quot;Wikimedia Forum&quot;]] on Meta. (Also, I am wondering whether an unsigned announcement is the right place for opinionated personal remarks of that kind.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA or Act) sought to protect minors from harmful material on the Internet. 47 U.S.C. §223(a)(1)(B)(ii) criminalized the &quot;knowing&quot; transmission of &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; messages to any recipient under 18 years of age. Section 223(d) prohibits the &quot;knowin[g]&quot; sending or displaying to a person under 18 of any message &quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot; 

Affirmative defenses are provided for those who take &quot;good faith, . . . effective . . . actions&quot; to restrict access by minors to the prohibited communications, §223(e)(5)(A), and those who restrict such access by requiring certain designated forms of age proof, such as a verified credit card or an adult identification number, §223(e)(5)(B). A number of plaintiffs filed suit challenging the constitutionality of §§223(a)(1) and 223(d). 

In ACLU v. Reno, after making extensive findings of fact, a three-judge District Court convened pursuant to the Act entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of both challenged provisions. The court's judgment enjoined the Government from enforcing §223(a)(1)(B)'s prohibitions insofar as they relate to &quot;indecent&quot; communications, but expressly preserves the Government's right to investigate and prosecute the obscenity or child pornography activities prohibited therein. The injunction against enforcement of §223(d) was unqualified because that section contains no separate reference to obscenity or child pornography. The Government appealed to the Supreme Court under the Act's special review provisions, arguing that the District Court erred in holding that the CDA violated both the First Amendment because it is over-broad and the Fifth Amendment because it is vague. The Supreme Court held that the CDA's &quot;indecent transmission&quot; and &quot;patently offensive display&quot; provisions violated the First Amendment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A direct current (DC) circuit usually has a steady and constant voltage supplied to it. A direct current does not have a continually changing polarity, unlike an alternating current (AC), but instead a constant direction and rate of flow. DC is generally provided by batteries or via a transformer, rather than generators. 

==Circuit diagrams==

Below are the symbols and names for all of the components that you are required to know:

[[Image:Circuit_Symbols_for_A-level-OCR-Physics_A.png|center|600px]]

==Series circuits==
When resistors are set up in series, the formula to work out the total resistance is: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_T = r_1+r_2+r_n...etc&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2&lt;/math&gt; etc., are the resistance of each resistor in series.

==Parallel circuits==
When resistors are set up in parallel, the formula to work out the total resistance is: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_t}=\frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}+\frac{1}{r_n} ...etc&lt;/math&gt; 

Where &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2&lt;/math&gt; etc., are the resistance of each resistor in parallel.

==Internal resistance==
A electrical source has its own resistance, known as '''Internal Resistance'''. This is caused by the electrons in the source having to flow through wires within it, or in the case of a chemical battery, the charge may have to flow through the electrolytes and electrodes that make up the cell.

By considering a battery of EMF E, in series with a resistor of resistance R we can calculate the internal resistance r:

&lt;math&gt;E=I(R+r)&lt;/math&gt;      (See Series Circuits above)

Combining with V=IR:

&lt;math&gt;V=E-Ir&lt;/math&gt; 

The quantity Ir is called the '''lost volts'''. The lost volts shows us the energy transferred to the internal resistance of the source, so if you short circuit a battery, I is very high and the battery gets warm.

==Potential dividers==
A potential (or voltage) divider is made up of two resistors. The output voltage from a potential divider will be a proportion of the input voltage and is determined by the resistor values.

The values of a battery with voltage V1 passing through two resistors in series of resistance R1 and R2, with an output circuit in parallel with Resistor R1 with output voltage V2 are related by the equation:
&lt;math&gt;V1=(R1/(R1+R2))&lt;/math&gt; × &lt;math&gt;V2&lt;/math&gt;

==Kirchhoff's laws==

First Law states &quot;The sum of the current (A) entering a junction is equal to the sum of the current (A) leaving the junction&quot;.
This is a consequence of conservation of charge.


Second law states that the EMF is equal to the voltage of the circuit. This is a consequence of conservation of energy.

==Use of other components==
Thermistors can be placed in circuits when temperature plays a role. As the temperature increases, the resistance of the device decreases. This does not obey the Ohms law. Light dependent resistors are resistors that decrease their resistance when exposed to light.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Oki. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Oki~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Introduction==

This book will eventually cover a large number of topics in the field of electrical communications. The reader will also require a knowledge of Time and Frequency Domain representations, which is covered in-depth in the [[Signals and Systems]] book. This book will, by necessity, touch on a number of different areas of study, and as such is more than just a text for aspiring Electrical Engineers. This book will discuss topics of analog communication schemes, computer programming, network architectures, information infrastructures, communications circuit analysis, and many other topics. 

''This book is still in an early stage of development. Many topics do not yet have pages, and many of the current pages are stubs. Any help would be greatly appreciated.''

{{warning|Several pages from this book have been moved to [[Communication Networks]] and [[Data Coding Theory]]. If you are looking for a page that seems to have disappeared, check in these places.}}

__NOTOC__
With the explosion of digital communications and digital media, the need for methods to process digital data is more important than ever. This book will begin with a look at the mathematical concepts behind digital processing, then will build on that with particular algorithms to do the work, and finally will present the actual implementations of these techniques in today's hardware and software systems. Many real-world algorithms are based on the techniques described in this book. JPEG images, MP3 songs, MPEG-2 videos, and ZIP files are all processed using digital processing techniques, and all of them will be discussed, at least conceptually. This book will not teach programming, and will probably not even provide much in the way of actual code, so we don't need to worry much about computer language dependence, except where otherwise noted. For some solid background information on the various mathematical theories in this book, consider reading [[Signals and Systems]].

''This book is in a very early stage of production, and many of the pages either don't exist or only exist as bare stubs. Help and contributions from all wikibookians will be very much appreciated!''

== Preface ==

{{wikipedia|Embedded system}}
{{Wikiversity|Embedded System Engineering}}

This book is about microcontrollers, in the field of digital control systems. 
We will discuss embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and other topics of interest. It is important to realize that embedded systems rarely have display capabilities, and if they do have displays, they are usually limited to small text-only LCD displays. The challenge of programming an embedded system then is that it is difficult to get real-time feedback from the system without a display. It is common to use a simple serial interface for diagnostic purposes, for example by connecting to a PC running terminal software via a RS-232 to USB adapter.  Also, embedded systems usually have very strict memory limitations, processor limitations, and speed limitations that must play a factor in designing an embedded system, and programming an embedded computer. This book talks about some of the specific issues involved in programming an embedded computer. It also covers some basic topics such as microprocessor architectures, FPGAs, and some general low-level computing topics. While many of the issues discussed in this book may apply to PCs, and non-embedded computers, this book remains focused on topics that apply to embedded systems only.

This book has incorporated a number of smaller books, stub-books, and half-books that were previously written about this subject.

&lt;!--In your wikilink paths, be sure not to write &quot;I/O&quot; as &quot;IO&quot;. if you write it the first way, you will get a page called &quot;O Programming&quot; instead of &quot;I/O Programming&quot;, and the backlinks will be broken--&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Nach0king. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Nach0king~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Accountancy==

I just spent a bit of time commenting on your proposed organization of the Introduction to Accounting (or just Accountancy) book, and then I noticed that you had done it almost four years ago.  I'm just curious.  Have you abandoned this project?

I'm also curious as to your background.  A book on accounting?  Another book on Cellular Automata?  This sounds a lot like my background.  (I double degreed while I was in college, with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.B.A. in Accounting.  I then went on in Accounting with a M.Acc., a CPA, CMA, and am currently in the Fiscal Services Department of a local government.)  But this is purely curiousity on my part.  Feel free to ignore this question if you think it's too personal, or just delete it. --[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:56, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== I acted on the merge and removed the [[Complex Analysis Handbook]] RfD ==
I acted on the merge request (not opposed) and removed your RfD. Since there is no need for archival or to establish a special closing of the RfD the only avenue was to remove the request itself. Feel free to edit the changes to [[Complex Analysis]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:22, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
:Unless the proponent of the RfD objects, I see no need to restore the RfD (though if there ''is'' an objection, it definitely gets restored).  Panic&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; for future reference, cutting the [[w:Gordian knot|Gordian knot]] by unilaterally removing someone else's RfD could go badly wrong if it were taken amiss, and there ''is'' (on reflection) an alternative that would fall safely within procedure, and get the job done: do the merge, and add a comment to the RfD saying you've done it.  The nominator has the opportunity to respond within the process, and if they agree, the RfD can simply be closed.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:28, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
::Yes I considered using the comment option, but decided that if any brouhaha would happen it would be reduced to those implicated and not extend to the rest of the community since at least I'm confident that two of us will be able to rapidly resolve any issue I selected the option that could create less distraction to the rest of the community. If Xerol objects to my action of course I will agree that the removal of the RfD should be undone and we will discuss it further there.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
::In any case we should think about a solution to this cases, IIRC this is the second time I've aborted one RfD using the same method but as you state it can be a cause of conflict (depending on those involved) since most abortable RfD originate in users with less experience and because of that more probable to escalate the issue. The action is made safe under BeBold, putting the issue of removing signed posts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:53, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Perform a non-admin closure and leave it up for a week.  It can then be archived. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:41, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
{{outdent|:::}} For the record the actual merge done borders on vandalism.  It appears to be a blind copy and paste of material from one book into the other with disregard of the content written in the page and elsewhere in the book, style, notation, etc.  Now the page on the derivative defines the derivative twice ''in the same module''.  Derives the Cauchy Riemann equations, in two consecutive modules and duplicates much of the material.  And material from the introduction of the book now appears as if for the first time at the beginning of Chapter 2.  I just don't understand why such the rushed job?  Why not look over the new book a little first? I will take a little time and see what I can do about cleaning it up. But I really wish you hadn't done the merge in the first place, it would have been easier to get right the first time. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:38, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
:Calling vandalism is a bit too harsh Thenub314, nothing was destroyed and people can improve on what is there. I refrained of doing any &lt;u&gt;reshuffling&lt;/u&gt; and complied with the non objected proposals for merge (the claim that I increased complexity is also unfounded), even Xerol clearly noted that some content was usable so I simply removed the need to put the process of salvage in the hands on the general community to the people that really are interested in working on it. Since Xerol RfD did spur interest in the content something constructive may result (I also did contact the Wikibooians working on the books and the original merge tagger). It was not a blind copy but also nothing more than a merge of related content. In any case it's best to discuss what to salvage that what to delete, it also may create a chance for you to add to it.
:I think that it would be more constructive to do what you see as needed changes in place of making hash judgments. I'll gladly appreciate any help you can provide in improving it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:52, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
::Basically I RfD'd it because I wanted to spur a bit of discussion, not being familiar with the topic, amongst those who could properly merge the material. I only noticed the page to begin with as part of my [[User:Xerol/Cleanup|war on orphans]], saw the merge notice, checked page histories, saw that a few constructive edits ''had'' been made since the merge notice was put up, looked at the merge target book, and then went to RfD to get comments. I even mentioned in the RfD that it seemed like the content could not be readily merged into the other book, simply because the writing styles were very different, and also mentioned that I only had limited knowledge on the topic, which I intended as a clue that someone more knowledgeable should take a look at it and inform the decision. Where did I &quot;clearly note that some content was usable&quot;? I said there wasn't much that could be merged that would add anything to the larger, more developed book. ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1885510#Complex_Analysis_Handbook_and_subpages Original edit here])
::I know that no one really &quot;owns&quot; a book but in nearly every case of dealing with subject matter with which I was unfamiliar I've elected to notify those who seem to be the primary editors on a book that action should be taken. In this case, had I not decided to put it up for an RfD (for instance, if there had been a lot of meaningful material that didn't appear in the other book, but the stubbier book was clearly still incomplete and completely inactive) I would've at the very least replaced the {{tl|mergefrom}} notice (which appears to never have been placed to begin with; the history merge makes it very confusing though), and at least left a note on the TOC's talk page plus any user talk pages as appropriate. If nothing had been done about it within a week or so I might've acted on my own (or, in this case, asked a friend with 2 master's degrees in math). Basically there's a lot of ways to do what was done, and the way this was handled seems like one of the worse ways to do it. But, looking through the pages with my limited knowledge, there was value added to the post-merge pages so it's not like a ridiculously egregious act was committed here. Lines may have been crossed but it all worked out in the end, so let's all learn some lessons and move on. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 23:53, 11 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I take that we are all done on this subject. I have been talking with Thenub314 and I assure you if anyone can have any blame here is me for being unable to predict this storm in a teacup. Sorry about the use of your talkpage but since you were the proponent of the RfD it seems unavoidable. Since you demonstrated interest on that content now merged I inform you that of the 70 lines of text on the original 3 pages, soon after the merge, only ~10 lines remain.
:::In regard to the BeBold I urge you to take on your own words and proceed in updating the manual of stile. I'm having a &quot;soft&quot; dispute regarding necessary distinction we need to make on the C++ Programming book as a requirement to inform readers on the version that is covered (C++0x is almost out and some information is already being put on the book). It would be nice to point to an accepted the text even if not a guideline to establish common ground.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:15, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
::::I need to clean up the text a bit (writing in an instructional/informative tone is something I have difficulty with) but I can put up an abridged version for now and add to it. There is a consensus that it should be added, so it'll get in there sooner or later, just probably a bit later as the MOS is something that I feel requires a little more carefulness than boldness. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 06:20, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

== Template ==
It would be useful also to cover &quot;also covers&quot; (if the information is mixed together) and &quot;the next version&quot; (even if it isn't a direct improvement it would be easier to search for the template after the release and fix it).  Just some thoughts based on what would be required on the C++ Programming book (see [[w:C++0x|C++0x]]), and due to some changes need to be covered next to existing &quot;old version&quot; content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:16, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
:You can put any text you want as the SoftwareVersion parameter, for example you could say &quot;0.47 and newer&quot;. DeprecationType probably isn't the best name for that parameter, but if you wanted a separate designation for &quot;Unreleased&quot; or &quot;Future&quot; it could be added.

If the aircraft were set to fly a particular ground track, the aircraft would not be blown off course by wind. The aircraft's ground speed would also be equal to its true airspeed, but as we have seen, this is not usually the case. The one element that affects ground speed and track is the effects of wind.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|bc programming language}}
'''bc''' is an arbitrary-precision calculator language. The ''arbitrary-precision'' means that numbers can contain unlimited digits (limited by memory); most other languages limit numbers to eight bytes at most. For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, there is unlimited precision. Division stops after a certain number of decimal places (usually 0 or 20), so &quot;bc&quot; is often bad with very small numbers (like 10e-44).

&quot;bc&quot; is often called using the &quot;-l&quot; option, which loads the standard library (which mostly contains trig functions) and sets the number of decimal places for division to 20. (Doing trig with the default precision of 0 decimal places is not so useful.)
==Example session==
This is an example of a user starting bc, doing two calculations, and exiting with &quot;quit&quot;. Note that pressing '''^D''' (control-D) also exits.

 $ '''bc -l'''
 '''3 + 4'''
 7
 '''2 / 5'''
 .40000000000000000000
 '''quit'''
 $

==Example script==
{{warning|Some versions of &quot;bc&quot; limit function and variable names to one letter. The following example has long function and variable names and must be changed to work on these copies of &quot;bc&quot;.

The following example was tested with OpenBSD bc and has also been verified with Gnu bc version 1.06 patchlevel 2.}}

This script implements [[w:Simpson's rule|Simpson's rule]] for integration. The function &quot;integrate&quot; approximates the definite integral from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; using &quot;n&quot; parabola sections. The formula for &quot;simpson&quot; is taken from [[w:Simpson's rule|the Wikipedia article]]. This example integrates the sine function, but different functions can be used by replacing f.

 define f(x) {
   return s(x);
 }
 
 define simpson(a,b) {
   return ( (b-a)/6 ) * ( f(a) + 4*f((a+b)/2) + f(b) );
 }
 
 define integrate(a,b,n) {
   delta = (b - a) / n;
   result = 0;
 
   for(i = a; (n = n - 1) + 1; i = i + delta) {
     /*print &quot;calling simpson(&quot;, i, &quot;, &quot;, i + delta, &quot;) with n = &quot;, n, &quot;\n&quot;;*/
     result = result + simpson(i, i + delta);
   }
   return result;
 }

Put this in a file, say &quot;simpson&quot;, load it, and integrate f from 0 to pi (pi is &quot;4*a(1)&quot;, 4 times arctangent of 1) with 100 intervals:
 $ '''bc -l simpson'''
 '''integrate(0, 4*a(1), 100)'''

Now explain these features so users can understand the script.
*variables and statements
*&quot;for&quot; loops
*functions (&quot;define&quot; and &quot;return&quot;)

==Basic operations==

===Conversions===
First check default values of base for input ( ibase) and output ( obase) numbers : 

 ibase
 10
 obase
 10

Note that  obase and ibase are special variables which define output and input base. Obase values range from 2 to 999 and ibase values range from 2 to 16. 

Then one can convert the number 12 from base 10 to base 2:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basicallytech.com/blog/?/archives/23-command-line-calculations-using-bc.html command-line calculations using bc by  Rob Newcater]&lt;/ref&gt;

 $ echo 'obase=2;12' | bc

and the result is :

==1. Tell how the following processes are related to lumber and how each process is done: ==
=== Growing Trees ===
Lumber comes from trees, so in order to get lumber, a tree must be cut down.  Before a tree can be cut down, it must be grown.  Many areas are managed forests, where once the trees have been harvested for lumber, new trees are planted to take their place.  Doing so make lumber a sustainable resource.  The science of growing trees is called forestry.

=== Harvesting of Trees ===
Harvesting of trees is the practice of cutting them down in order to convert them into lumber.  There are several approaches to this, including clear cutting and selective cutting.

When a forest is clear cut, all woody plants are removed.  The larger ones are cut into 16' sections and used for making lumber.  Contrary to popular belief, clear cutting can actually be beneficial to the forest, as it simulates the effect of a natural forest fire.  The trees that are planted in the clear cut will receive more light, and thus produce more lumber more quickly.  However, the clear cut should be replanted with the same species of trees that were harvested from the area.  Clear cutting is often done during a season on several small tracts of land in a larger forest.  This staggers the harvest so that it can be more easily sustained over long periods of time.  

Selective cutting is the practice of only removing mature trees from a forest.  This has a lesser impact on the forest, but it takes longer to produce lumber and it is more labor intensive than clear cutting.  Selective cutting preserves other aspects of the forest though, including its beauty, and its role as a wildlife habitat.

=== Milling ===
Milling lumber is the process of sawing logs into boards.  This is usually done at a saw mill.  There are many ways to cut a log into boards, and the method chosen affects the quality of the lumber and the amount of lumber that can be obtained from the log.  Quarter sawing produces the highest quality lumber, but it does not produce as much lumber as other methods (such as flat sawing).  In quartersawn lumber, the log is first divided into quarters, and then each plank is sawn from that such that the growth rings go through the plank perpendicular to the plank's face.

[[Image:Quartersawn.png|300px|Quartersawn Lumber]]

In flat sawn lumber, All the cuts are made in the same direction.  Thus, the growth rings penetrate the board at many different angles.  This method of cutting produces the most lumber from a log, but that lumber will be far more susceptible to warping and cupping.

[[Image:Flatsawn.png|320px|Flatsawn Lumber]]

=== Curing/Seasoning ===
Curing and Seasoning lumber are two words for the same process.  It is the process of drying lumber after it has been milled.  When timber is first cut, over 50% of its weight is water.  As the lumber dries, it changes shape.  If it is dried unevenly, it will warp, twist, and crack (cracking is also called &quot;checking&quot;).  This is because as the lumber dries, it shrinks.  If it dries unevenly, it will also shrink unevenly.  To season lumber, it must be allowed to dry evenly.  There are several ways to accomplish this, but the two most common are air drying and kiln drying.  After the lumber is milled into rough boards, it is stacked horizontally in layers.  Each layer is separated by &quot;stickers&quot; which are small pieces of wood about an inch thick, an inch or two wide, and as long as the stack is deep.  Stickers are placed on the floor first, and the first layer of lumber is stacked on top of it.  More stickers are placed on top of the first layer directly above the stickers on the floor, and another layer of lumber is placed on them.  This is repeated until there is a large stack of lumber.  Separating the lumber like this allows air to circulate evenly, and thus, the lumber will dry evenly.  Kiln dried lumber is stacked in a kiln (a type of oven) in the same way as air dried lumber.

=== Grading ===
The quality of lumber is widely variable.  The difference between the wood suitable for making shipping crates and pallets and the wood suitable for making furniture and toys is fairly large.  Grading lumber is the process of assigning a quality figure to it - not unlike grading a school paper or a test.  Lumber is graded based on the poorest side of the lumber, and on the yield the lumber is expected to produce (that is, how much of the wood can be converted into boards verses how much will be thrown away).

There are four basic grades of lumber, and even these grades have sub-categories.  The basic grades are listed here from the highest quality to the lowest quality:

'''FAS ''' is short for &quot;'''F'''irsts '''a'''nd '''S'''econds.&quot;  Lumber of this grade is at least 83% clear (free from all defects such as stains, splits, worm holes, knots, etc.) on its poor side.

'''No. 1 Common''' is the next grade of lumber.  It is often used in furniture making.  It must be 67% clear on its poor side.

'''No. 2 Common''' must be at least 50% clear on its poor side.  It is often used in cabinet making and in millwork (molding, baseboards, and other trim).  This grade of lumber is excellent in applications that will be finished with paint (as opposed to a natural finish).

'''No. 3 Common''' is the lowest grade of lumber.  There are two sub-categories called 3A and 3B.  3A must be at least 33% clear, while 3B must be at least 25% sound (rather than clear).  3A is often used for flooring, while 3B often used for making pallets and crates.

=== Sizing ===
Once lumber has been milled and cured, it is sized.  There are three common methods of sizing lumber.  The first and most common is dimensional.  The most well known of the dimensional sizes is the 2 by 4 (2x4).  Other sizes include the 2x6, 2x8, 4x4, etc.  Before a 2x4 is sized, it is 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide.  The lumber is then planed so that the edges are smooth and the thickness is even.  The planing process removes about a half inch of lumber, so the finished 2x4 is really 1.5 inches thick by 3.5 inches wide.  It is still called a 2x4 though, because that's much easier than calling it a 1.5 x 3.5.

The second sizing method is known as quartering.  Rough sawn lumber is sized in quarter inch increments.  A one inch thick, rough sawn plank is called four-quarter, and this is written as 4/4.  Rough sawn lumber is also available in 5/4, 8/4, and 10/4 sizes.  These are 1.25&quot;, 2&quot;, and 2.5&quot; thick respectively.

The third sizing method is the board foot method.  A board foot of lumber is one inch thick, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches long.  In other words, a board foot of lumber contains 144 cubic inches of wood.  Even if the plank is not 12 inches wide or one inch thick, it is still sold by the board foot.  One way to calculate how many board feet are in a plank is to first calculate the number of cubic inches (width times thickness times length, all in inches) and then divide that by 144.

==2.  Collect and label five different kinds of wood used in woodworking.  Tell the advantages and disadvantages of each. ==
'''Pine'''
Pine is the most commonly available wood in North America.  Its primary advantage is that it is relatively cheap.  This is because it grows rather quickly.  Another characteristic of pine is that it is soft.  This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The advantage of a soft wood is that it is easy to work.  The disadvantage is that it can break easily; delicate joinery that works fine in hardwoods will not hold up in pine.

'''Oak'''
Oak is a very common hardwood.  It is a tough wood that holds up well when stressed.  It was often used in shipbuilding because of this toughness.  Additionally, oak is fairly workable up until it is seasoned.  Seasoned oak is ''very'' hard, which makes it difficult to cut, bore, plane or drive a nail through.  This is an advantage in the finished product, but a disadvantage when trying to make something.  When using oak, it is best to use unseasoned wood, and let it season once the object has been made.

'''Maple'''
Maple is a light colored wood that can be found with highly figured grain.  Figured grain is difficult to work with, but makes for a beautiful piece of furniture.  Maple is also great for toy making because it does not easily splinter and stands up well to the abuse of even the most destructive of children.  Maple is also commonly available, and thus, is relatively cheap for a hardwood.

'''Walnut'''
Walnut is a dark hardwood.  Its color is one of its chief advantages, and is probably wood most often &quot;copied&quot; by staining lighter, cheaper woods.  Walnut also has figured grain and is fairly hard.  It holds detail well, so it can be used in making intricate joints.  It is also relatively expensive for a native hardwood.

'''Cherry'''
Cherry is another hardwood that is commonly used in furniture making.  Its color starts off as a medium brown and then slowly turns to a dark, beautiful reddish hue over time.  It takes a nice finish, and has no need for stain.  It is a little cheaper than walnut, but still fairly expensive.

'''Poplar'''
Poplar is classified as a hardwood, but it is relatively soft (though still harder than pine).  Because of its softness, it is easy to work.

'''Elm'''
Elm is a hardwood that is highly resistant to splitting.  Because if this, it was the only wood used to make the hubs of wooden wagon wheels.  It has a highly figured grain that entwines, and tangles itself in all directions - this is what makes it so difficult to split, but it also makes it difficult to plane.

==3. List the basic hand and power tools necessary to do woodworking.  Know how to safely use each tool and how to keep it in proper working order, including sharpening, if applicable. ==

Technically, no power tools are necessary for woodworking - everything can be done with handtools.  Power tools can certainly make the job easier, but they are a relatively recent tool to arrive on the woodworking scene.

=== Handsaws ===
Handsaws are tools used for cutting wood.  Handsaws come in many varieties, including the crosscut saw, rip saw, coping saw, tenon saw, backsaw, and dovetail saw.  Each has its own special use.  A crosscut saw is used for cutting across the grain of a piece of lumber.  A rip saw is used for cutting along the grain.  A coping saw is used for making curved cuts.  A tenon saw is used for cutting tenons and other fine work.  A backsaw is commonly used with a miter box and for small cutting jobs.  A dovetail saw is used for cutting dovetail joints.

To use a crosscut or a rip saw, place the board on a supported surface at thigh-height (between the knee and hips).  Grip the saw with the right hand (assuming right-handedness) and use the left knee to hold the board in place.  Align the right shoulder, arm, and hand so that they are in line with the cut to be made.  Begin with light strokes, noting that the saw cuts on the push stroke.  As the cut progresses, keep an eye on the line, pulling the blade toward it.  If this is to be a &quot;finished&quot; cut, you can score a &quot;V&quot; along the line first with a carton knife, and let the blade ride in the V groove.  Score another line along the bottom of the board to prevent tear-out.

A saw is sharpened with a triangle file.  The teeth of a rip saw (which cuts along the grain) are sharpened perpendicular to the blade.  The teeth of crosscut saw are sharpened at an angle.  Try to match the angle already ground into the teeth.  

Maintain your saws by keeping them dry and sharp.  Many tools (including saws) can be kept in great condition by wiping them down with a cloth and oil (or WD40) after each use.  Coping saw blades can be obtained cheaply enough that it is easier to replace them than it is to sharpen them.

=== Chisels ===
Chisels can be used for making a variety of cuts in wood, from mortise and tenon joints to dovetail joints.  They are often struck with a mallet or a hammer, but sometimes they are pushed by hand (watch for fingers!) to pare a joint or to smooth it.  Chisels are also used to remove wood for recessing a hinge.  To do this, the outline of the hinge is first scored with a knife, and then the wood is pared away with the chisel.

To cut a mortise, choose a chisel that is as wide as the desired mortise.  Mortises should only be cut so that they are parallel to the grain of the wood.  Mark the mortise out, and then place the chisel perpendicular to the grain, such that it covers the width of the mortise.  Strike it with the mallet.  Then move the chisel about an eighth of an inch (2-3mm) farther down the mortise and repeat.  Each &quot;bite&quot; of the chisel will go a little deeper.  When you get to the end of the mortise, reverse the chisel and take bites in the other direction (still perpendicular to the grain, but heading back toward the other end of the mortise).  Continue until the mortise reaches the desired depth.  Always cut the mortise first, and then size the tenon to fit.

To sharpen a chisel, hold it at a steady angle and drag it along a whetstone.  If you use a grinder, be careful to not overheat the tip of the chisel as this will cause it to lose its tempering.  It is better to sharpen them by hand with a whetstone, as it is very easy to overheat the blade with a grinder.

Store chisels in a way that will protect the cutting edge, either by covering them, or placing the edge where it will not come into contact with anything of equal (or greater) hardness than the blade.  Like saws, chisels can be wiped down with cloth and oil to keep rust away.

=== Hand Planes ===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Woodworking Tools/Plane}}

=== Clamps ===
Clamps are used to hold a piece of wood in place while it is being worked, or to hold pieces of wood together after gluing them until the glue cures.

Clamps come in many varieties, including C-clamps and furniture clamps.  Some say that it is nearly impossible to own too many C-clamps.  When using a C-clamp in wood working be careful to not overtighten it.  The clamping surface can easily leave a circular impression on the wood.  If you need to get it really tight, place a piece of scrap between the clamping surface and your piece.  

Furniture clamps (also called bar clamps) often have padded clamping surfaces, so making unwanted impressions on the wood is avoided.  These are used for clamping large boards together, usually edge-to-edge.

Clamps can be periodically wiped down with a cloth and oil to keep rust at bay.

=== Drills, Bits, and Braces ===
Drills, Bits, and Braces are used for boring holes in wood.  A brace and bit is the &quot;old-style&quot; cordless drill.  It is hand-powered.  The brace holds the bit, and the woodworker's hand cranks it, inducing a rotation in the bit.  To drill a clean hole with either a brace and bit or a drill and bit, hold the bit perpendicular to the board and start drilling.  You can start a pilot hole with a nail or a punch first to keep the bit from wandering.  There are two ways to prevent tear-out when boring a hole.  The first method is to support the board and drill into the supporting material.  For this to work, the board and its support must be firmly clamped together.  The second method can be used if you have a bit with a point that is much narrower than the hole's diameter (such as a spade bit, a brad-point bit, or a bit with a screw-lead).  Using such a bit, drill through the material until the tip comes through the other side.  Then turn the board over and place the bit in this hole.  Continue drilling toward the center.

=== Power Tools ===
Power Tools should be used with much care.  It is difficult to cut a finger off with a hand saw, but a power saw can do this in an instant, and before the careless operator even feels any pain, a severed finger can drop to the floor.  Power tools can greatly speed production of wood projects though, so it's certainly worth having them around.  Read the owner's manual carefully before operating any piece of power equipment.  Pay special attention to safety features, and do not try to defeat them!  Pathfinders below the age of 16 should not use power tools.  Remember, power tools are not required for woodworking, they only speed it along.

==4. Explain the following joints: ==
=== Butt ===
A butt joint is the simplest of all joints, formed by butting two pieces of wood together and then joining them.  But because glue will not hold to end grain, it is a joint that must be held together by mechanical fasteners such as nails or screws.

[[Image:Butt_joint.png|350px|Butt Joint]]

=== Dado and groove ===
[[Image:Dado joint.svg|right| Dado Joint ]]
A dado and groove joint is formed by milling a slot (or dado) in one board, and inserting another board into that slot.  The width of the dado should be equal to the width of the board that will be inserted into it.  The dado is an excellent joint for joining plywood shelves to the upright sides of a bookcase.  In this case, the dado should be cut into the side, and the shelf should be inserted into the dado.  Such a shelf will support a lot of weight without relying on the strength of a mechanical fastener.  A butt joint would likely fail in this situation, with the nail or screw splitting out the top of the shelf.

The dado can also be used in regular lumber as long as the dado runs along the grain - otherwise, any glue used to secure the joint would have to adhere to the endgrain.  Plywood presents alternating layers of endgrain and straight grain to all three surfaces of the dado, and there is generally enough straight grain in the joint that gluing it works well.  Dado and groove joints can be held together with mechanical fasteners (nails or screws), or without them (assuming enough non-endgrain surfaces in the joint).

=== Dovetail ===
[[Image:dovetail.png|right|300px|Dovetail Joint]]
A dovetail joint is made by making &quot;tails&quot; in one piece of wood, and &quot;pins&quot; in the other.  In the diagram here, the tails are made in the board on the left, and the pins are made in the board on the right.  This joint is very strong and will only pull apart in one direction.  It is often used for making drawers and boxes.  When making a drawer, the pins are cut in the drawer front, and the tails are cut into the drawer sides.  This will prevent the joint from pulling apart when the drawer is opened.  A drawer facing is then glued to the front to hide the joint, or the joint can be modified to hide them inherently (these are called &quot;blind dovetails&quot;).

To make the joint, cut the tails first.  Lay them out with a bevel gauge, and saw from the edge to the line.  Remove the waste with a chisel.  Then lay this board on top of the board that will have the pins and line them up.  Mark the pins with a knife.  Then saw the pins with a dovetail saw (or a backsaw).  The waste on either side of the pins can be removed with a saw. The waste between the pins can be removed with a chisel or with a coping saw.  Assemble the joint to test it for fit, and pare the joint with a chisel if necessary.

In the illustration, the endgrain is colored orange.  When gluing a dovetail joint, don't bother applying any glue to the endgrain surfaces.  Note that the top surface of the pins (brown) are not endgrain, nor are the surfaces they mate to on the tails.

=== Dowel ===
[[Image:Dowel_joint.png|right|Dowel Joint]]
A dowel joint is formed by drilling holes in the two pieces to be joined, and inserting dowels (small wooden rods) into these holes.  The dowels are coated with glue prior to insertion.  This is most commonly done with butt joints and miter joints, as the addition of the dowel greatly increases their strength by providing gluable surfaces to the joint.

The most difficult aspect of making a dowel joint is lining the holes up on the two pieces of wood and making sure that the holes go in at a 90 degree angle.  This can be done more easily with the aid of a doweling jig.  A doweling jig resembles a clamp with a guide hole drilled into it.  It is clamped to the board which will eventually accept the dowel, and the hole is drilled by inserting the bit into the guide.  A doweling jig will ensure that the hole is drilled at a consistent distance from the board's facing edge and that it is made at a 90 degree angle.  The woodworker is still required to ensure that when multiple holes are used (recommended to prevent the joint from twisting), they are drilled the same distance apart.

=== Lap ===
[[Image:Lap_joint.png|350px|left|Lap Joint]]
A lap joint is made by overlapping two boards.  Wood is removed from the joint so that each board contributes about half of the wood in the joint.  Lap joints can be made to join boards at a 90 degree angle (as shown), no angle at all (that is, splice two boards into a longer one), or the two boards can form a cross.  This joint is ideal when you need to bring two boards together but keep them in the same plane.  It is very strong even without mechanical fasteners as there is a lot of gluable surface area in the joint.

The laps can be cut with either a saw, or a with a saw and a chisel.  Large lap joints should be cut with only a saw, but they can be trimmed with a chisel.  A dovetail saw or a backsaw works well for both cuts.

=== Miter ===
[[Image:Miter_joint.png|350px|right|Miter Joint]]

A 90 degree miter joint is formed by cutting the two boards at a 45 degree angle and joining them.   The choice of a miter joint is purely aesthetic. Miter joints are easy to cut with a power miter saw, but difficult to cut by hand.  A miter box can help, but the angle of the cut must be very nearly perfect, or the joint will either not be 90 degrees, or it will show a gap.  The gap can be eliminated by &quot;kerfing in&quot; the joint.  Kerfing in a joint is done by clamping the two pieces together and then running a fine-toothed handsaw down the joint.  Ideally, the saw should remove wood from both pieces.  This procedure can be repeated until the woodworker is happy with the fit, but keep in  mind that every time this procedure is performed, the board gets a little shorter.  For this reason, it is best to cut the miter joint first, and then cut the piece to length.  If both ends of the board are to be mitered, the board should be cut a little long and then tuned to length by kerfing it in.

Miter joints must be reinforced or they will not hold (once again, endgrain comes into play).  Usually the pieces are fastened to some underlying structure so that the miter joint is not subjected to stress, nor is it relied upon for structural integrity.  In other cases, the joint itself can be reinforced using dowels (as in a dowel joint) or some similar mechanism.

=== Mortise and Tenon ===
[[Image:Mortise_and_tenon.png|250px|right|Mortise and Tenon]]

The mortise and tenon joint is a strong joint used to join two pieces of wood usually at a 90 degree angle.  The mortise is a hole cut into one of the pieces, and the tenon is shaped to fit snugly into this hole. The tenon is usually narrower than the rest of the piece that it is cut into.  The joint may be glued, pinned, or wedged to lock it in place.

The mortise is usually cut first, and its width is equal to the width of the chisel used to cut it (see the section on chisels).  The tenon is then sized to fit the mortise, and it is cut with a tenon saw, dovetail saw, or backsaw.  The first cuts are made along the grain and are called the cheek cuts.  The final cuts are made across the grain and are called the shoulder cuts.  The tenon can be pared with a chisel to tune the fit.

=== Rabbet ===
[[Image:Rabbet.png|200px|right|Rabbet Joint]]

A rabbet joint is very similar to a dado joint, except that the groove is cut at the edge of the board.  This groove is called a rabbet.  It is also sometimes called a rebate.  A rabbet joint is often used for joining the back to a cabinet or bookcase.  It can be glued, held on with mechanical fasteners, or both.  The rabbet can be cut in either or both pieces to be joined.

A rabbet joint can be made with a table saw or a router.  It can also be made with a rabbet plane.  The blade of a rabbet plane comes all the way to the edge of the tool so that it can remove wood from the corner of the rabbet.

==5. Know the characteristics of and how to work with the following: ==
=== Hardboard ===
Hardboard (also called Masonite) is an engineered wood product made by turning wood chips into long fibers by steaming them.  These fibers are then heated and pressed into a solid board.  Hardboard is sold in 4'x8' sheets of various thicknesses in the United States.  It is an extremely stable material, expanding and contracting very little with changes in temperature and humidity.  It is highly homogeneous, having no distinct grain.  Because of its lack of grain it behaves very differently as compared to regular lumber.  

Hardboard has high bending strength, but has very little structural strength, so it cannot be used in many applications where plywood or regular lumber are more suited.  It can be used for building arches, and its strength can be improved by laminating several sheets together.  Hardboard is often used as drawer bottoms, or as the back of cabinets, etc.

=== Particle Board ===
From [http://www.wikipedia.com Wikipedia], the free encyclopedia.

Particle board (sometimes called chipboard) is a material manufactured from wood particles (for example, wood chips, sawmill shavings, or even saw dust) and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Particle board is very dense, heavy, and flat. It is used as a cheaper and less durable substitute for solid wood or plywood. Particle board is very prone to expansion due to moisture.

Particle board should not be used in applications where it is likely to get wet.  It is generally not used in furniture making unless it is covered with a veneer (or in inexpensive furniture, a vinyl covering similar to wallpaper).  It is not generally finished with stain, varnish, or paint, as aesthetics are not high on its list of characteristics.  It is, however used in the hidden portions of woodworking projects such as drawer backs and sides.

=== Plywood ===
From [http://www.wikipedia.com Wikipedia], the free encyclopedia.

Plywood was the first type of engineered wood to be invented. It is made from thin sheets of wood veneer, called plies, which are stacked together with the direction of each ply's grain differing from its neighbors by 90° (cross-banding). The plies are bonded under heat and pressure with strong adhesives, usually phenol formaldehyde resin, making plywood a type of composite material.

A vast number of varieties of plywood exist, tailored for all manner of conditions and uses. Softwood plywood is usually made either of Douglas fir or spruce, pine, and fir. Decorative plywood is usually faced with hardwood, including red oak, birch, maple, lauan (Philippine mahogany) and a large number of other hardwoods.

Plywood production requires a good log, called a peeler, generally straighter and larger in diameter than that required for processing by a sawmill. The log is peeled into sheets of veneer which are then cut to the desired dimensions, dried, patched and glued together to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, resized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market it was intended to be sold in.

The most common varieties of softwood plywood comes in three, five or seven plies with dimensions of 4 feet × 8 feet. Each ply is 1/8 inch. 

A common reason for using plywood instead of plain wood is because plywood is more stable and because it is less prone to change (shrink, twist or warp).  Plywood is stronger than particle board and hardboard, and because the outer layers can be made from fine hardwoods, it is often used in furniture making.  It is suitable for natural finishing or painting.

==6. Know at least two ways to finish the edges of plywood. ==

Unfortunately, some layers of plywood often have knots in them, and the knots fall out before the layers are glued together.  This leaves a void.  In furniture-grade plywood these voids will be confined to the inner layers.  In order to finish the edge of plywood, you can either fill these voids with a wood putty, or you can cover the edges with a band of material - typically, a veneer or a thin strip of wood.  Some veneers are made expressly for this purpopse, and they come with an adhesive on one side.  By heating the veneer, the adhesive is activated.  When it cools, the adhesive bonds to the edge of the plywood.  If you plan to use a natural finish, banding works best, because wood putties and wood tend to take natural finishes unevenly.  This results in a splotchy finish where the wood putty stands out rather than concealing the defect.  Either method can be used if you plan to finish with paint.

==7. Demonstrate the proper technique of gluing and clamping wood. ==
The first rule of gluing wood joints is that glue does not stick to end-grain.  Most woodworking joints were in fact designed to avoid the application of glue to an end-grain surface.  Evaluate your joint first, and find two non end-grain surfaces that will come into contact.  After making a test fit, apply glue to one of these surfaces.  Spread the glue in a thin layer, being careful to not use too much glue.  Then clamp the two pieces together.  Use enough clamping pressure so that the pieces are held firmly together, but do not use so much force that all the glue is squeezed out of the joint.  Once clamped, the pieces should be left alone until the glue sets.  Setting times vary from one glue to the next, so read the instructions on the glue container.

==8. Choose a plan for and complete an article of household furniture, such as a small table, footstool, writing desk, or bookcase.  List the materials needed for your project. ==
There are thousands of plans available on the Internet, and many of them can be downloaded for free.  Others are offered for a fee.  You can also find plans in books and in woodworking magazines (although the magazines tend to have more complex plans).  Choose plans that are simple.  Although the instructor may be an experienced woodworker, the student is often not.  Avoid complicated joints such as dovetails and mortise and tenons.  Butt joints, dados, and lap joints are within the reach of a 12 year-old, so steer your Pathfinders to projects that use them.  Use lots of pine.  Pine is relatively inexpensive, and using it makes it a lot easier to start over.  It can be heartbreaking to watch a youngster destroy an expensive piece of wood, and the temptation to salvage it (and thus ruin the project) can be overwhelming.  Save complicated projects and expensive hardwoods for after the Pathfinder develops some skill.

[[image:Sm_table_complete.jpg|240px|right|Small Table]]

The table described here has been successfully constructed by a group of Pathfinders ranging from Friend to Guide.  It is relatively inexpensive, as seven tables can be constructed from a single sheet of plywood, five 8-foot 2x4's, some plywood banding, 28 1/2&quot; #8 woodscrews, seven dozen 1.5&quot; #8 woodscrews, some flat metal brackets, and some 3/8&quot; dowels.  Seven is a good number of Pathfinders for two instructors to handle in this honor.  More Pathfinders (or fewer instructors)  and it is difficult to give them the attention they'll need to execute the project successfully.

=== Preparations by the Instructor ===
The instructor should rip the 2x4's into 2x2's, and perhaps crosscut them into 30&quot; lengths (although this can be left to the Pathfinder).  These 2x2's will make the legs of the table, and the instructor should make sure the legs are square (that is, each side should be 1.5&quot; or 1.25&quot;  wide - the exact measurement is immaterial so long as it is the same on all four sides).

[[image:Sm_table_parts.jpg|240px|right|Small Table Parts]]

The instructor should also cut the plywood into squares.  For seven tables, 14 12&quot;x12&quot; squares (for the bottom and middle shelves) and 7 14&quot;x14&quot; squares should be made (for the tops).  These should be made from furniture-grade plywood with a hardwood veneer.  Birch veneer works well for this.

=== Cut the corners ===
The Pathfinder should mark the corners of the shelves by measuring in 1 inch from each corner and drawing a line across the corner.  If the shelves are square, this should make a perfect 45° angle.  Do not cut the corners off the 14&quot;x14&quot; tabletop.  Save the corners, as they can be used to correct a common mistake (discussed below).

=== Notch the legs ===
The pathfinder should then cut two notches in each of the four legs in the three steps shown below:

[[image:Sm_table_cut_legs.jpg|350px|Cutting the Notches]]

'''1:''' Mark a pencil line one inch from the corner edge of the leg.  Do this on two adjacent sides.

'''2:''' Measure the width of the plywood and mark where the notches are to be cut with a square.  It is better to mark all the legs at the same time, making sure leg bottoms are flush and the notches all line up.  Once all the notches have been marked, a notch can be made by cutting two kerfs (saw cuts) through the corner of the leg stopping when the line is reached.  You may wish to score the notches with a carton knife before using the saw.  Make the first score on the line, holding the knife at a 90° angle.  Then make a second score at a steeper angle next to the first score line, but towards the middle of the notch so that the two make a V.  Remove wood from the V.  This will give you a defined groove for the saw blade to ride in.  Pay close attention to ''both'' lines when cutting, and be sure to take the width of the kerf into account when making the cuts.  The width of the notch should equal the width of the plywood.  

'''3:''' Use a 3/4&quot; chisel and a mallet to remove the wood between the kerfs.  Do not try to remove all the wood at once, but rather, remove a quarter inch on the first three passes, and an eighth of an inch on the final passes.  Pay attention to the pencil lines.

=== Attach the Shelves===
The next step is to attach the shelves to the legs.  This can be done using dowels or screws.  In either case, drill holes into the leg from the outside, centered on the notches.  Put the shelf into the notch, and drill a hole into it, using the hole in the leg as a pilot.  If using dowels, use the same sized bit (sized for the dowel, 3/8&quot; recommended).  If using 1.5&quot; #8 screws, use a 1/8&quot; bit, and then counter sink the hole in the leg 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; deep.  The screws can be covered with dowels or with wood putty (but don't use wood putty unless you plan to paint).

=== Correcting Problems ===
If the notches are too wide, use a chisel to shear a ply off the corners that were removed from the shelves and wedge it beneath the shelf.  Note that this is a corrective procedure only - it is much more desirable to cut the notches to the proper width.  Using this technique pretty much decides that the table will be finished with paint instead of with a natural finish, but it can still come out looking pretty good.  If the notches are not wide enough, use a chisel to widen them a bit.  Don't overdo it.

If the notch is too wide to be corrected with a single ply from a corner, discard that leg and start over.  That's why the legs are made from 2x4's - you can get six legs from a single 2x4, so each leg will run you about 50 cents (in 2005 anyhow).

Once both shelves have been attached to all four legs, the screws can be covered with dowels (if the screws were countersunk) or with wood putty.

=== Fasten the Top ===
Finally, it is time to add the top.  The easiest way to do this is by using flat metal brackets.  Look for them in the fastener department of the hardware store.  Basically, they should be pieces of steel about 3/8 inch wide and 2 inches long, with holes drilled in either end.  At least one of these holes should be countersunk, or they should be countersunk on opposite sides of the bracket. 

[[Image:Leg_bracket1-4.png|600px|thumb|1. Bore first hole; 2. Overlap second hole; 3. Connect the channels; 4. Attach the bracket]]

&lt;br&gt;

Mill a groove into the top of the leg to accept the bracket.  This can be done with a 3/4&quot; spade bit or auger.  Drill into the endgrain no more than an eighth of an inch, centered on the leg.  Drill a second hole overlapping the first, and make sure the edge of the hole extends over the inside corner of the leg top.  If necessary, chisel out a channel between the two holes and then lay the bracket in the channel.  The brackets should point towards the center of the table top.  

Attach the brackets to the legs using 1.5 inch #8 screws.  Make sure that bracket is oriented such that the ''other'' hole will be countersunk when a screw is passed through it into the bottom of the tabletop.  

Once the brackets are attached, turn the top upside down (choose the best surface for the top), and place the rest of the table on top of it.  Center to the best of your ability.  The table top is oversized to hide any &quot;unsquareness&quot; of the rest of the table.  If the unit will not lay flat on the table top, mark the underside of the tabletop where the screws are touching it.  This can be done by daubing a little wood putty on the screw head.  Remove the unit and drill a small hole no more than a quarter inch deep into the underside of the table top.  It helps to wrap a piece of masking tape around the drill bit at the desired depth so the woodworker can stop when the tape reaches the wood.  Replace the unit on the table top again.

Drive screws through the brackets into the underside of the table.  Again, use #8 screws, but remember that the table top is only 3/4&quot; thick.  Play it safe and use 1/2&quot; long screws.

=== Finishing ===
The only thing that remains is to finish the plywood edges and paint (or use a natural finish).  Use veneer banding for this, following the instructions on the label.  Trim the edges of the veneer off with a carton knife or a chisel.  Sand the table and apply two coats of paint or stain and varnish.

If this is a first-time project, the Pathfinder is likely to achieve better results with paint than with stain and varnish.  If painting, go back over the piece and cover all screw holes and imperfect shelf joints with wood putty.  Woodworking masters eschew wood putty, but it is appropriate for the novice.  Wood putty and paint can cover a multitude of woodworking sins!

=== Leveling ===
If the table needs to be leveled, place it on a flat surface such as a workbench or a table covered with hard board or cheap plywood.  Have one of the longer legs hang off the edge while the other three are in contact with the flat surface.  Use a saw to cut the bottom of the offending leg off by laying the blade on the flat surface and drawing it into the leg.  This '''will''' mar the surface of the table unless a &quot;flush cut&quot; saw is used, but executed properly, it is by far the easiest way to level a table or a chair.

==9. Know and use the proper steps in finishing a wood project with either natural finish or stain. ==
The first step in finishing a wood project is to make sure all the surfaces are smooth.  This is most commonly done by sanding the surfaces with sandpaper, starting with rougher paper (80-100 grit) and then progressing though successively finer grits (often to 220 grit).  Sanding is only necessary if the surface is not already smooth, and some tools (notably planes and cabinet scrapers) will leave a sufficiently smooth surface so that sanding is unnecessary.  In fact, sandpaper was patented in the United States in 1834, and woodworking had been going on for millennia prior to that!  

The next step in finishing is to remove all dust and dirt from the surface.  This can be done by wiping the wood down with a tack cloth, or with a soft cloth which has been wet with mineral spirits.  Tack cloth is a soft cloth that has been treated with various finishing compounds (such as mineral spirits and varnish) so that it is slightly sticky or &quot;tacky.&quot;  It picks up any wood dust it comes into contact with.

Once the surface has been prepared, it can be stained.  This can be done by wiping the stain on with a soft cloth (wear vinyl gloves) or with a paint brush.  Read the instructions on the can.  Staining wood can even out its color.  It generally does not fool an experienced woodworker into thinking pine is really walnut or cherry.  Staining is optional.

Once the project has been stained (if staining was desired), it can be coated with a finish such as varnish, polyurethane, or tung oil.  The purpose of these finishes is to reduce the absorption of moisture.  Some finishes do this better than others.  Recall that as wood absorbs moisture, its shape changes, so limiting the amount of moisture the project can absorb is a very desirable thing to do.

These finishes are applied again with either a soft cloth (wear gloves!) or a paint brush. You can also buy finishes in spray cans.  Several coats are applied, but remember that it is always better to apply several thin coats rather than a few thick ones.  Again, read the instructions on the can.  Some finishes require that the product dry completely between coats, and others do not.

Make sure the finish is applied in a dust free environment, and do not stir varnish prior to its application, as this will only introduce bubbles which will appear in the finished product.  If you do get bubbles, they can be rubbed out between coats with very fine sand paper or with steel wool.  The final coat should not be sanded but should rather be polished with a soft cloth.

==10. Do two of the following: ==
=== Make a project with a door or lid with inset hinges. ===
=== Make a scale model of a house or building with a cutaway view showing the interior detail.===

'''One way to do this is to create a 1:20th scale model that looks much as a real house does before it has siding and a roof put on it'''.  Use balsa wood, a sharp razor blade, and balsa glue.  

Create a house plan (keep it simple).  You may use typical houseplans that are available in Houseplan magazines and books or create your own.

In order to achieve greatest accuracy, it is recommended that you draw out the scale model to full size grid-paper.  Make sure to mark all doorways, windows, entries, and stairs.

Determine what balsa wood sizes will represent each of the standard stud sizes.

'''Another option''' is to build a doll house out of wood.  These are usually 1:12 scale models, and make a great gifts! Doll House kits are available for sale online.

'''Purchasing the kit or the balsa wood can be rather expensive'''.  Talk with the hobby shop in your town before beginning!  They'll probably help you make the wisest financial decisions.  This would be a great project to work on as a class or unit!

=== Assist in making and/or repairing wooden toys for needy children. ===
Any toys you make can be included in the packages that are often delivered to needy families during the Pathfinder's Can Collecting activity.  

[[Image:Toy_tugboat_illustration.png|250px|right|frame|Tugboat]]
'''Tugboat'''&lt;br&gt;
An easy toy to make is a small tug boat.  This can be made from two pieces of scrap wood and a dowel - dimensional lumber (2x4's) works great for this.  The bottom piece makes the boat's hull and deck, and the top layer makes the cabin.  Cut the hull to shape with a coping saw and smooth with a rasp.  Before cutting the cabin to its final dimensions, drill the hole for the smokestack.  It's a lot easier to drill into a large piece of wood than it is to drill into a small piece.  You could also clamp the cabin in a vise for drilling.  If desired, bore the hole at a slight angle (about 5°) so the smokestack tilts back. Glue the smokestack dowel into the cabin, and glue the cabin onto the hull.  If you use a waterproof glue such as epoxy, the glue joint will be strong enough to not require further reinforcement.  Otherwise, reinforce the cabin/hull joint with screws through the bottom of the hull into the cabin.  Make sure the screw is well recessed so that it does not scratch the floor (or table) when the tug is dragged around.  Optionally, you can drill a small hole straight down through the deck near the front of the boat, and drill a larger hole into the hull from the bottom so that it meets the small hole.  Pass a rope through the hole and tie a knot in it to keep it from pulling through the smaller of the two holes.  It would be easier to use an eye screw, but this may present a choking hazard to small children.  Sand well, and finish with colorful paint.

'''Car'''&lt;br&gt;
Another option is to make Pinewood Derby cars.  See the instructions in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Pinewood Derby|Pinewood Derby]] section of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts|Arts and Crafts]] chapter of this book.

=== Make a project using dowel, miter, or mortise and tenon joints. ===
=== Make a project using curved cuts, or beveled or rounded edges. ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">That sounds good - I'm a bit iffy about leaving out the pure grammar lessons entirely, though - I don't think it's possible to have adequate grammar if grammar lessons are disposed of entirely - but I am all for having grammar more integrated into the topic of the lesson.  Maybe occasionally have a 'Grammar Lesson'?

Perhaps expand Petit(e)s Ami(e)s into just &quot;relationships&quot; - so can talk about relationships with families, friends, etc.

Maybe have a revision lesson (+quizlet) every three lessons or so?  

Here are some lesson suggestions - if I seem to be duplicating, it might be because I think there should be more in that topic than you are currently suggesting:
===Beginners===
*Ca va? (perhaps have some material from la corps here, but it should be fairly early in the lessons)
*Quelle heure est-il? - What's the time? (inc. 24 hour time)
*Months and Days - Birthdays, Saints' days, seasons. (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
*Decris-toi! - Describe yourself (personality and looks, also be able to describe others)
*Je suis perdu! - I'm lost! (Asking where places are, directions)


===Intermediate/Advanced===
Can I please suggest some lesson subjects?  (pinched from the Board of Studies, NSW, Australia).. ;)
*&quot;Relationships&quot; - do you get on with your family/friends, what kind of a friend are you, talk about your relationship with your petit(e) ami(e).
*&quot;School Life and Aspirations&quot; - what kind of career do you want in the future, what are your favourite subjects and why, do you learn well from your profs, etc.
*&quot;Young Person's World&quot; - pop culture, mass media, politics, what they think of fashion, if they have a part-time job.
*&quot;Leisure and Interests&quot; - hobbies, leisure, past hobbies, technology, mobile/cell phones
*&quot;Daily Life/Lifestyles&quot; - self explicatory, really.  
*&quot;Controversial Issues&quot; - again, fairly self explicatory.
*&quot;Quand j'etais petit(e)&quot; - talk about yourself as a child. (learn the past tense for stuff that's dead and gone) 
see [http://www.boredofstudies.org/community/showthread.php?t=37468&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15] for more info/ideas. Thanks! - [[User:220.237.30.150|220.237.30.150]] 23:39, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== French overhaul ==

Hey there. I am a Wikipedian new to Wikibooks but I found the French book and I must say, it is indeed in need of a dire overhaul. Once you return from your vacance, please contact me at [[w:User_talk:Averykrouse|my talk page]] on WP. I would be more than happy to partner up with you for such an endeavor.</text>

-----

1) Position:  You have probably heard the expression &quot;location, location, location&quot; in real estate.  That doesn't mean anything in wrestling. The wrestling (or grappling) corollary is &quot;position, position, position.&quot;  Indeed, I would argue (simply to make the point academically as, of course, I do teach &quot;technique&quot;) that there is no such thing as &quot;technique,&quot; only increasingly good positions variously strung together with movement that increase the favorability of your being able to control your opponent along the way.  Sticking with the context of takedowns on this post, #1 would be to maintain a good stance and position on your feet as you approach and move with your opponent.  Between this and #'s 2, 3, and 4 (and whatever number defense will involve--OK I might cheat and go beyond 7), if your opponent can't effectively initiate an attack and score on you, because your position, movement, attacking, and tie-ups/clinching is very effective, the worst situation is a draw (if we are talking solely takedowns); and if you have some of the other 7 points down, you should be able to score yourself.

The main points here would be a) knees bent, back angled slightly (not exactly vertical, not horizontal) with your chest, knee, and ball of foot roughly aligned, b) generally being in a staggered stance although you need to be able to move in a square stance, c) head up, visual attention directed to your opponent's chest, d) weight mostly on the balls of your feet, equally distributed between each foot, and e) hands out in front, palms facing each other (to keep elbows in).

Along these lines, a) learn one side first (e.g., lead right or left, I like left because that is also my boxing lead so I keep left leg forward in MMA so I don't clue my opponent as to whether a striking or takedown attack is coming, b) focus on different techniques depending upon whether your opponent leads the same or mirrored leg to you versus switching your lead if your opponent &quot;doesn't cooperate&quot; by leading the leg you hope he leads (e.g., with my left leg lead, I attack double or outside single to my opponent's left side if his left leg is lead or I go to head inside single on the right if his right leg is lead; that being said, eventually, you want to develop some competence with the other leg being lead but first develop competence on one side), and c) if you do MMA, STILL first learn the traditional wrestling stance and way of attacking so you learn to properly and consistently learn to lower your level on attack.

2) Movement:  Position is not static but fluid.  The trick is to move while maintaining good position, minimizing openings favorable for your opponent to attack, and maximizing your ability to quickly and effectively attack your opponent.  A) don't cross your feet, b) take small, short, low steps to be able to initiate an offensive or defensive maneuver quickly (for at least half of the time your foot is off the ground (i.e., moving downward from the top of the arc of your step) you can't redirect your movement unit it makes contact with the mat--and that is a clue to a good time to initiate an attack on your opponent), and c) don't let your feet get too close together as you step.

3) Initiating Attacks:  A) lower your level simultaneously with your set-up (but lower level before your transition in so your trajectory is into your opponent, not downward and into the mat), b) your hips lower but the angle of your back remains about the same and your head remains up, eyes open, directing your visual attention to your opponent all the way in (typically towards his chest), c) lean forward slightly prior to initiating your attack (just as you would if you are preparing for a sprint vs. starting a jog), d) don't back up with your body or hands before you attack (a common mistake; as I lower my level my weight is subtly shifting forward before I step in), d) consider moving your hands to your opponent's legs a millisecond before you step in with the reason being that smaller muscles can't be recruited for movement quicker and more deceptively than larger muscles and assist in more stealthily attacking (think of the cartoon analogy where the character punches and his arm stretches out &quot;pulling&quot; the rest of his body after), e) hand movement needs to be linear (from where they are to where they need to be; shortest distance...quickest), most typically striking straight out, elbows in (think &quot;Alien's mouth&quot; analogy), f) don't drag your rear foot on attacks utilizing the penetration step, g) your speed and continued momentum into your opponent are, in part, predicated on quickly following up with your rear foot instead of having it &quot;hang out there&quot; (your rear foot should &quot;catch up&quot; to a frame a millisecond behind your knee making contact with the mat; think simultaneous will help you here), h) don't blink your eyes but keep your visual attention on your target the whole way in (you would be amazed how many people blink or close their eye when attacking), i) on any penetration step attack, momentum CONTINUES through your opponent so your finish must transition immediately and logically (i.e., the particular finish for the particular position you end up with relative to your opponent's initial defensive maneuver); your goal is not simple to &quot;land in front of your opponent&quot; but to continue moving through him.

4) Tie-ups and clinch and set-ups:  Your ability to control your opponent while on your feet is predicated on your ability to move him and to keep him in unfavorable position to attack you and position favorable for you to attack.  Set-ups are important (e.g., head pop, arm post, drag, etc.) but being able to physically manipulate your opponent so they are unable to attack your effectively is king.  A) developing proficiency with pummeling, underhooks, 2-on-1, PROPERLY utilized collar tie, etc. is crucial.  Against high caliber opponent's a simple forehead tap, quick hand movements to distract him, moving myself, are likely of little utility.  It's not about how much you move yourself (which you actually generally want to be economical to maintain your own good position) but how effectively you move your opponent and you have to make contact to move a good opponent.  B) associated with this, it is crucial to be able to logically and fluidly transition from on tie or clinch position to another so that your opponent is continually preoccupied by having to break your tie and control.  A secret to this is to become proficient in controlling and moving your opponent's head in the process of pummeling, clinch, and ties.  It would take a separate post on pummeling and clinch to get into the details of all of this.  Suffice to say competitive pummeling is NOT just underhook and overhook arms swimming back and forth with your opponent.

5) Think high or low in attacking.  You asked, basically, about favorite techniques.  Before I get into that, I would suggest first conceptualizing your attacking in two domains, low and high.  &quot;Low&quot; is attacking below the waist, mostly with your hands, and &quot;high&quot; is attacking the waist and above with your hands and, paradoxically, attacking the legs with your legs.  For example, (hand to) leg attacks are typically successfully done when your opponent's level is relatively high either because his level was spontaneously that way or because of your manipulating him with a tie-up or set-up.  Sometimes a person is just too darn well defended to easily attack his legs, most typically, at least in part, because his level is relatively low.  When his level is too low to attack his legs (with my hands), his head is usually low enough to attack (snap down or snap to front headlock).  When I am doing this and his level gets higher, either the legs become more open for a leg attack or I can do leg-to-leg attacks such as inside and outside trips or I can throw.  Breaking this down to the most basic level to learn, I am first trying for doubles, head outside singles, and high head inside singles.  If my opponent is to low for me to attack his legs successfully, I know his head is low enough to attack (snap) to a front headlock.  Instead of getting frustrated with continued unsuccessful leg attacks, I simply transition to attacking the head.  If he defends this successfully, his head is going up as is his level, at least to some degree, so I focus on attacking the legs...and on and on.  The upshot of this is that against high caliber opponents, you can't depend on success with &quot;just leg shots.&quot;  Even if your front headlock is poor with regard to scoring, you need to have proficiency at least to a level to threaten your opponent into more favorable position to attack his legs.  I hope that I am getting the notion of &quot;back and forth&quot; or &quot;high and low&quot; across adequately.

6) Basic seven movements:  You asked about the &quot;favorite seven.&quot;  The so-called basic seven movement skills (although I sometimes see somewhat different numbers associated with this) of USA wrestling are key.  These movements/skills are the foundation for good wrestling.

7) Body build/technique and strategy match:  Your body type, in my view, dictates, at least to some degree, the type of techniques and positions you favor and those to avoid.  For example, being small, my game is to prioritize attacking my opponent's legs as, usually, my level is (more comfortably) lower.  When I can't do that, I go to the head.  With one of the guys at Absolute Jiu Jitsu, who is tall, I try to get him to tie up, get underhooks, and attack the head as his priority.  Because of his height, he will have a bit more difficulty attacking his opponent's legs so I try to have him, for example, work underhooks (jacking his opponent up with the underhook because he is taller vs. sagging down with it as I do because I am smaller than my opponents) with good head position.  Being smaller than my opponents, it is very crucial for me to avoid an overhook position to my taller opponent's underhook; a taller individual, however, has some more realistic options with an overhook.  Generally, with little people, tie-ups involve sagging; with taller people jacking their shorter opponent's up.  The upshot of this is your base techniques, tactics, and strategy must be rationally related to your body build, physical attributes (e.g., slower folks want to focus on getting good tie-ups and staying in close and not focus on trading &quot;pinging&quot; leg attacks from a greater range) against most opponents (and, of course, specific opponents).

8) Killer defense:  When an opponent does attack, he needs to be punished for the audacity and lack of respect.  Sprawling and wizzers (etc.) are important but understanding the idea of putting and keeping your attacking opponent's head underneath your abdomen or hip.  This would be a long topic for another day but defense needs to be conceptualized in terms of &quot;lines of defense.&quot;  The first level is that if you are attacking and your opponent is defending, your defending is a moot point.  The second line of defense is controlling the tie-up.  Different tie-ups eliminate or make difficult various attacks by your opponent.  In other words, learn which tie-ups prevent which of your opponent's attacks and focus on defending the ones must likely successful from that tie-up.  The third line of defense not letting your opponent get past your head (learn to keep forehead contact with your opponent to &quot;feel&quot; his intent to attack then keep blocking with your head).  If he gets past your head, the next line of defense is with your hands or arm blocking his head and/or shoulders if opponent gets by your head.  This is front headlock city territory.  The LAST major line of defense is when your opponent gets to your leg (of course, I'm not talking about defending various tie-ups, throws, etc., just leg attacks here).  It is at this point where virtually all non-wrestlers and, frankly, most wrestlers, make mistakes.  Again, getting into defense in a detailed manner is for another day but suffice to say your immediate goal is to get your opponent's head under your abdomen or hip, get out in front, pull him down and either spin behind or front headlock (all of which involve a lot of technique to be done correctly).  In the process, you can torture your opponent and make him more hesitant to attack your legs.  This style of defense (level 5) works BEAUTIFULLY with BJJ and submission wrestling as you can easily transition quickly to positions where you can work submissions.  I am just a little squirt and I'm not even close to weighing what others do in our school but I can put a hurting on guys substantially larger with the concept of (opponent's) &quot;head down&quot; defense.

9) Some favorites of mine: Talking actual (takedown) attacks, my goal is to mix attacks based upon aggressive pummeling, clinching, and handfighting, including working a lot on the head then thinking &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high.&quot;  This &quot;preparation&quot; work is crucial and pays dividends.  The more active your pummeling and handfighting, the more successful will be your actual attack; the converse is true as well.  This may sound lame but I score most on a head outside single, then high head inside single, then double leg, at least with traditional leg attacks.  However, I mix this in with frequent head snaps to a front headlock and pull my opponent down to the mat and spin behind, etc. when I have tugged his weight on his hands so he can not reach up and catch me as I come around back.  For throws, which I think is an art that is fading away owing to changes in freestyle and greco rules, I like a fireman's carry (works well against relatively bigger guys who would cause me some hesitation in attacking their legs.  I love arm throws and arm spins but the latter you need to cautious in finishing and repositioning quickly so you avoid a choke.  I also love inside and outside trips, both of which are underutilized, in my view.  Finally, I like foot sweeps (e.g., from &quot;over and under&quot; position while pummeling) as well as a more nontraditional foot sweep when I am in a regular stance at handfighting distance which I use to off-balance my opponent or sometimes kick my opponent's leg to a grab a head inside single.

Of course, if preparation (e.g., pummeling, handfighting) is &quot;phase one&quot; and attacking (e.g., &quot;the shot&quot;) is &quot;phase two,&quot; you still need to have a good &quot;phase three&quot; in terms of finishes to complete the takedown especially as your opponent responds to your attack with various defensive maneuvers.  That last phase is also a whole new discussion and is rather technique or situation specific.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I might get started on a generic Intro to Programming book for use in &quot;Intro to X&quot; courses for [[Wikiversity:School_of_Computer_Science|Wikiversity: School of CompSci]]. Book would cover generic programming concepts (from variable assignments/calculations to control structures to functions) with examples in several languages.

'''Tentative Outline'''
*Variables
**Concept of a Variable - What one is, why they're important, and data types (integer, float, string, etc.)
**Initialisation - Discussion of allocation of memory.
**Assignment - They're called 'variables' for a reason.
**Operations - Basic math stuff for numerical variables, and string operations.
*Comparisons/Boolean Operations
**This would basically be the whole &quot;Less than/greater than/etc.&quot; and &quot;OR/AND/NOT/etc.&quot; in prepraration for the next section.
*Basic Control Structures
**If-Then-Else
**While/Do-While
**For-Next
**Switch
*Functions - Discussion of inputs/outputs.
**Standard Functions (Ones included with basic libraries or by default)
***I/O
***Mathematical
***Other things I forgot
*Arrays
**Libraries - This is just a basic overview of the expandability of programming languages.
*Program Structure - Now that we've defined the basic elements of programming languages, we can begin to build a program.
**&quot;Hello World&quot;-type program
**Creation of a program to perform a task

Examples may be provided in a large number of languages, either directly in-line or as links to other books. However, considering that this book is intended to be a very introductory look at the basic building blocks of programming languages in general, the examples should either be provided in as many different languages as possible, in pseudo-code, or not at all.

For section 5, Program Structure, this is where pseudo-code starts to be insufficient. As such, the examples here would be very basic in nature. For example, the Hello World program might be as follows:

 Include IO Library
 
 main:
  output &quot;Hello, World&quot;
  quit

A certain style of pseudo-code would be introduced throughout the book, and would inevitably be creating a pseudo-language of sorts. The task program could be, perhaps, to read in 5 numbers from a file and output the numbers, their average, and each number squared to the screen. The squaring would need to be computed via a function. The pseudo-code might look something like this:

 Include IO Library
 Include File Library
 
 Declare function square(integer n) returns integer
 
 main:
  declare numbers (array of 5 integers)
  declare sum (integer)
  declare average (float)
  open file
  for (1 to 5)
   get number from file and store in numbers array
  
  set sum to 0
  for (1 to 5)
   add numbers to sum
  divide sum by 5 and store in average
  
  for (1 to 5)
   output numbers
  output average
  for (1 to 5)
   output square(numbers)
  quit
 
 function square(integer n) returns integer:
  return n*n

The format may need to be worked on a bit, I'm not entirely sure how to present functions in pseudocode yet. Generally the point is to show the code in words rather than syntax as much as possible, but once you get into functions you almost have to use ''some'' syntax of some sort. However, by this point in the book, all of the individual concepts will have been explained and the general idea from here is to tie the concepts together into an entire program that could be translated into any language (for the most part). For something like FreeBasic, you wouldn't have a Main function and you wouldn't have to include any libraries for screen or file IO, but anything like that would be covered in the very opening areas of any course on the subject. 
The above program wouldn't be given straight out, but built piece-by-piece throughout the chapter, in the format of solving the &quot;problem&quot; at hand: Getting numbers from a file and outputting the average and squares. This kind of thing is what I originally intended by the purpose of the book but I'm now seeing that for any larger programs it'll be extremely difficult to explain with elegant psuedocode.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few things I've noticed:
*First off, even your single-line code examples should probably be put in code blocks. It would probably also be made more clear if the new term/operator was bolded. For the AND example:

 statement1 '''&amp;&amp;''' statement2

*I personally prefer the term 'expression' over 'statement' in this case, to me a statement implies an entire line of code, while an expression is something that's evaluated down to a single value. 
*In 'Chains of Combinations' the given expression !(statement1 &amp;&amp; (statement2 || statement3)) evaluates to true if statement1 is false, or if both statements 2 and 3 are false. Regardless of what statement1 is, statement 2 &amp; 3 both being false would force the entire expression to be false, and the NOT would make it true. So perhaps it should read:
''This chain would be true if statement 1 is false (no matter what statements 2 and 3 are), or if statements 2 and 3 are both false.''
*'Comparisons' should make special note of the difference between the double and single equals signs; although the linked-to WikiBook makes note of this it deserves to be reiterated. Considering that the module is supposed to be a class lecture it should hit on such &quot;easy mistakes&quot; with great force. 
*Also of note here is the lack of discussion on order-of-operations to this point; complex expressions are already being introduced and yet it hasn't been covered in lecture or side-reading yet. This could possibly be confusing as those not accustomed to programming practices may be expecting expressions to evaluate left-to-right. If there's one place that's a good place to introduce it, however, it would be after the Combining Statements section. The very last subsection of that, 'Chains of Combinations' would probably work out better in the order-of-ops section anyway. 
*In the course index, the layout isn't consistent. Lesson 1 has Lecture followed by Reading; Lesson 2 has Reading and then Lecture. 
*I'm going to go through right now and make some grammatical/spelling fixes, it should be noted that Quizzes has 2 Z's.
*I'd like to hear other comments on this before making major edits, but I'll put in some small changes now. This class doesn't seem to be &quot;live&quot; yet so there's still time to get some things sorted out. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 02:36, 26 October 2005 (UTC)


:All of those things sound like improvements to me.  What you don't get to before then, I'll ty and fix up tomorrow night.  I know this material needs a lot of work.  So does the book, for that matter.  Its good to have another pair of eyes looking at it, some things seem so natural you forget you have to tell people about it after a while.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 09:20, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">With CELX it's easy to create custom key functions, and assign them to different keys on your keyboard. Here's how:

First, you create a Lua function using CELX to implement your custom function. In this example, we'll create a new key function which zooms the active view so that the currently selected object fills the view:

&lt;tt&gt;
 zoomToFit= function()
    obs = celestia:getobserver()
    obsPos = obs:getposition()
    sel = celestia:getselection()
    if sel == nil or sel:name() == &quot;?&quot; then return end
    selPos = sel:getposition()
    dist = obsPos:distanceto(selPos)
    rad = sel:radius()
    appDia = 2*math.atan(rad/dist)
    obs:setfov(appDia*1.20)
    celestia:flash(&quot;Zoom to fit &quot;..sel:name(), 2) 
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;

Next, you create a table which maps a selected key to your new function. In this example, we'll use the &quot;z&quot; key:

&lt;tt&gt;
 keymap = {
    z = zoomToFit
 }
&lt;/tt&gt;

Then, you create a key handling function to call your new Lua function when the desired key is pressed, and assign it as the Celestia keyboard callback:

&lt;tt&gt;
   celestia_keyboard_callback = function(key) 
       f = keymap[key]
       if f then 
          f() 
          return true
       end
          return false
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that when there's a custom key definition for the input key, the callback returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; to indicate to Celestia that no further processing of the key is needed. Otherwise it returns &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;, and Celesta will handle the key according to the built-in key function assignments.

Finally, you tell Celestia that you want the callback to be called when a key is pressed, and then you wait for input:

&lt;tt&gt;
   celestia:requestkeyboard(true)
   repeat
       wait(10)
   until false
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the script has an infinite loop, so you'll need to use the escape key to terminate it.

Once you've got the basic script,  you can assign other new key functions simply by defining the Lua functions to implement them, and adding them to the key map.

Give it a try!



== Download the script ==
Below you can find the whole script (without comments) in a single text block. Copy everything in the grey box and paste it into a text file in your favourite text editor, and save that file in your scripts directory as zoomtofit.celx. Then open it (File/Open Script) from within Celestia to see the script in action. 

 -- Zoom To Fit function script
 
 zoomToFit= function()
   obs = celestia:getobserver()
   obsPos = obs:getposition()
   sel = celestia:getselection()
   if sel == nil or sel:name() == &quot;?&quot; then return end
   selPos = sel:getposition()
   dist = obsPos:distanceto(selPos)
   rad = sel:radius()
   appDia = 2*math.atan(rad/dist)
   obs:setfov(appDia*1.20)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Zoom to fit &quot;..sel:name(), 2) 
  end
 
 keymap = { z = zoomToFit }
 
 celestia_keyboard_callback = function(key) 
      f = keymap[key]
      if f then 
         f() 
         return true
      end
         return false
  end
 
 celestia:requestkeyboard(true)
 repeat
      wait(10)
 until false

----

===Distinguishing upper from lower case===

Unfortunately, the example above does not distinguish between the typing of upper case (capital) letters and lower case letters. 

When Celestia calls the function celestia_keyboard_callback, the function's argument (&quot;key&quot; in this example) contains the letter that was typed. A simple string of IF statements can distinguish among them:

 celestia_keyboard_callback = function(key) 
      if key == &quot;F&quot; then 
         zoomToFit() 
         return true
      end
         return false
  end

This form of the callback calls the function zoomToFit if an upper-case F is typed, but lets Celestia handle all other letters, including lower-case f.

A semicolon introduces a pause greater than that of a comma but less than that of a period.
This is a semicolon: ;

; To Clarify a Series : Semicolons separate elements of a series when the items are long or when individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas. 

*Example: She leaves a son, Mike Nach, of Arizona; a daughter, Emily Rosa, of Colorado; and a sister, Sara Evans, of Minnesota.

; To Link Independent Clauses : A semicolon joins two [[Rhetoric and Composition/Types of Sentences|independent clauses]] within one a sentence without the use of a coordinating conjunction. 

*Example: The horse was due for an immunization; the veterinarian administered one today.
  
; A semicolon may also be used if there is a [[Conjunctive adverb|Conjunctive adverb]] in the sentence. 

*Example: “I must go grocery shopping; however, I must pick up the dry cleaning today.” 

; Placement with Quotes : Semicolons should always appear outside quotation marks.  

*Example: Marcus often says that &quot;people should remain true to their faith&quot;; however, he is not a man of faith.

==Common Misuses==
Some examples of improper use of the semicolon:

*Between a subordinate clause and the rest of the sentence.  Example:  Unless you are coming home before your curfew''';''' don't bother coming home. 
*Between an [[English in Use/Commas|appositive]] and the word to which it refers.  Example: My favorite animal is a parakeet''';''' a type of bird.
*To introduce a list. Example: I own these cars''';''' a Dodge Stealth, an Acura RSX, and a Geo Storm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Malayalam is the native language spoken by the people of Kerala, the southernmost state of India, bordered by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

All Malayalam-speaking people are called Malayalis. Malayalam is one of the a classical language. Malayalam evolved from an ancient south Indian language, from which Telugu, Kannada and Tamil also evolved.

Malayalam has a very rich culture. Some of the greatest contributions have been made by Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan. The language uses 56 letters. Spoken language has many colloquial variations between the Southern and Northern versions. The name 'malayalam' is derived from the word 'mala'(hill). 

The name 'Malayalam' has a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest name of a language which is a palindrome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These small closed cylinders of soft metal are crimped over the inner cable end to prevent fraying/unraveling of the cable.
This is more important than it sounds at first,cables last longer and don't damage clothing as a fraying cable can. It may even stop a small but very annoying puncture wound on your calf. 
Sometimes these are provided with replacement cables - they are always fitted to new bikes.

=== Alternate methods ===

==== Soldering ====
A better solution is to use a soldering iron and some soft solder to the same end- simply heating the cable , &quot;wicking&quot; in some solder and then trimming for neatness.
With this method there is no possibility of it going astray- as crimp on ends can and do.

==== Spoke Nipple ====
A very cheap and effective solution is to use an old spoke nipple.  The nipple is slid over the end of the cable and crimped on with a sturdy pair of pliers.  Some pliers have a crimping area behind the pivot which works vey well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Slices ==

It seems to be that all of the discussion on indexing/slicing should be in one place.  Right now the discussion is split rather awkwardly between here and the strings section.  Within the list section we can just cover slice/index assignment. --[[User:Artevelde|Artevelde]] 09:27, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

==Length of a list==

Nice work, but how about a paragraph about
len(list), max(list), min(a)

== Why so few programming examples? ==

Almost all of the Python example code is shown as code that is generated from the interactive interpreter, but things that work there do not work in a Python script. For instance, from the Python documentation:

&lt;code&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = set(basket)               # create a set without duplicates&lt;br /&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit&lt;br /&gt;
set(['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'banana'])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

But if one enters the word &lt;code&gt;fruit&lt;/code&gt; on a line by itself in a script, you do not get output, you get a syntax error. Now you can use print to output the set fruit, but how do you use &lt;code&gt;sys.stdout.write()&lt;code&gt; for finer-grained control of output?

Programming examples would be a tremendous help, and more apt to be relevant to what the reader is trying to accomplish than command line examples.

== Code examples use the reserved word list ==

The use of the reserved word list is not really recommended. Is it not better to change the variable names from &quot;list&quot; into &quot;alist&quot;?
[[User:Ploffie|Ploffie]] ([[User talk:Ploffie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ploffie|contribs]]) 09:34, 18 December 2011 (UTC)

== Multiple 'for's in a list comprehension ==
&quot;It will evaluate the items in all of the objects sequentially and will loop over the shorter objects if one object is longer than the rest.&quot;

This statement doesn't make any sense.  Multiple fors in a list comprehension behave as if they are nested loops; in the example, 'pot' is looped over simply because it is the inner loop.  Changing the order of the statements would cause 'flower' to be looped over instead even though it is larger.

It would be more correct to describe the behavior of the example as being equivalent to the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; item = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in 'flower':
&gt;&gt;&gt;     for y in 'pot':
&gt;&gt;&gt;         item.append(x+y)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==
This algorithm generates very beautiful sounds, even if its idea is much simpler than that of other algorithms. It generates a perfectly looped wavetable sample which can be used in instruments. It easily generates sounds of ensembles, choirs, metallic sounds (bells) and many others.

This algorithm is public domain. This page includes some public domain C/C++ implementation sources that can be used in your projects or products.

This algorithm is implemented in [http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net ZynAddSubFX] in the &lt;i&gt;PADsynth&lt;/i&gt; module, which you can download to hear for yourself what beautiful sounds it is capable of generating.

The source code of this algorithm is available for free to be implemented in many software/hardware synthesizers. If your synthesizer uses plenty of samples, you can use this algorithm to generate many ready-to-use samples.

== Sound examples of instruments that use this algorithm ==

These sound examples are generated by ZynAddSubFX. All instruments' wavetables are generated by this algorithm.
These examples are grouped into two categories:

=== With Effects ===
In this category, some effects are used. These effects can be reverberation, phaser, etc. Mostly, the only effect was the reverberation.

{{Listen|type=music
 | pos = left
 | filename     = Padsynth_example_bells_string_choir.ogg
 | title        = Bells, Strings and Choir
 | description  =
 | filename2    = Padsynth_example_synth_piano.ogg
 | title2       = Synth Piano
 | description2 =
 | filename3    = Padsynth_example_phased_choir.ogg
 | title3       = Choir with Phaser effect
 | description3 =
}}
{{clear}}

=== Without Effects ===

All instruments in this category the instruments are &quot;dry&quot;. No reverberation, no other effects.

{{Listen|type=music
 | pos = left
 | filename     = Padsynth_example_noefx_bell_strings.ogg
 | title        = Bells, Strings
 | description  =
 | filename2    = Padsynth_example_noefx_organ_choir.ogg
 | title2       = Organ and Choir
 | description2 =
 | filename3    = Padsynth_example_noefx_saw_piano.ogg
 | title3       = Saw Piano
 | description3 = (this example contains the same notes played many times, but with different bandwidth and harmonic profiles)
}}
{{clear}}

== Tips and suggestions ==

#Keep in mind that the resulting wavetables are perfectly looped
#When using the wavetables into instruments, on each NoteOn, start from a random position and not from the start. This avoids hearing the same sound on each keystroke
#You can use the same wavetable for generating stereo sounds, by playing the same wavetable at different positions for left and right. The best is to make the difference between left right as N/2
#Generate different wavetables for different pitches and use the one who is closest to the desired pitch
#Upsample or downsample the harmonics's amplitude array before running the algorithm, according to the fundamental frequency. In this case we need to set a parameter &lt;i&gt;&quot;base_frequency&quot;&lt;/i&gt; which represents the frequency where the array is left unchanged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;tt&gt;  Example: we have &lt;i&gt;A_orig[]&lt;/i&gt;={1,2,1,3,0,0,1,0} and &lt;i&gt;base_frequency&lt;/i&gt; is equal to 440 Hz&lt;br/&gt;Here are some cases:&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for 440 Hz: is the same as A_orig[]&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for 220 Hz: is the A_orig[] upsampled by factor of 2&lt;br/&gt;so: A[]={1, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 1.5, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, 1.5, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 2, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, 1.5, &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;, 0, &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;, 0.5, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 0.5, &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;(the original A_orig amplitudes are shown as bold)&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for 880 Hz: the A_orig[] is downsampled by a factor of 2&lt;br/&gt;so: A[]={1.5, 2, 0, 0.5}&lt;br/&gt;- A[] for &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; Hz: the A_orig[] is scaled by a factor of 440/F.&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if this idea is very simple, the resulting sounds are very natural, because it keeps the spectrum constant according to the harmonic's frequency and not to harmonic's number. This folows the point 4 from the document where I described some principles regarding synthesis.

      <comment>changed &quot;abnormal&quot; to &quot;defecient&quot; for clarity, tried to explain why GI diet is useful in terms of blood glucose not just metabolic ability</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

'''Low-GI diet''' refers to a diet that advocates consumption of foods with a low [[w:glycaemic index|glycaemic index]] (GI).  The glycaemic index measures the rate at which the body converts the carbohydrate in a given food to glucose (blood sugar).  A low-GI diet is useful for people with diabetes, as either their bodies' insulin production is deficient or their bodies are insulin resistant, restricting their ability to metabolise glucose. Thus a lower GI diet causes less variation in blood glucose levels which makes the condition easier to manage.

Low-GI diets have benefits for non-diabetics also.  A high-GI diet results in peaks and troughs of energy throughout the day, whereas a low-GI diet results in a good level of sustained energy.  Low-GI foods also tend to have a longer satisfaction period per calorie given the slow energy release, which is useful in maintaining a healthy weight loss/control diet.

It should be noted that, since the glycaemic index measures the rate at which the carbohydrate in the food is converted into glucose, it can be misleading for foods with a low quantity of carbohydrate. The carbohydrate in carrot has a medium GI but, since a carrot only is about 7% carbohydrate, it has a relatively small effect on the blood glucose.  For this reason, some people advocate use of the [[w:glycaemic load|glycaemic load]] (GL) instead, which is simply the GI divided by 100, times the quantity of carbohydrate (in grams).

Foods such as meat which have no carbohydrate have no GI. 

A GI of up to 55 is low, 56-69 medium and 70+ high.  Glucose has a GI of 100.

A GL of 10 or less is low, 11-19 medium and 20+ high.

== The Fourier Series ==

The Fourier Series is  a specialized tool that allows for any periodic signal (subject to certain conditions) to be decomposed into an infinite sum of everlasting sinusoids. This may not be obvious to many people, but it is demonstrable both mathematically and graphically. Practically, this allows the user of the Fourier Series to understand a periodic signal as the sum of various frequency components.

== Rectangular Series ==

The rectangular series represents a signal as a sum of sine and cosine terms. The type of sinusoids that a periodic signal can be decomposed into depends solely on the qualities of the periodic signal. 

=== Calculations ===

If we have a function f(x), that is periodic with a period of 2''L'', we can decompose it into a sum of sine and cosine functions as such:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{2}a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty\left[a_n\cos\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)+b_n\sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients, a and b can be found using the following integrals:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\cos \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^L f(x)\sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;n&quot; is an integer variable. It can assume positive integer numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...). Each value of n corresponds to values for A and B. The sinusoids with magnitudes A and B are called ''harmonics''. Using Fourier representation, a harmonic is an atomic (indivisible) component of the signal, and is said to be ''orthogonal''.

When we set n = 1, the resulting sinusoidal frequency value from the above equations is known as the '''fundamental frequency'''. The fundamental frequency of a given signal is the most powerful sinusoidal component of a signal, and is the most important to transmit faithfully. Since n takes on integer values, all other frequency components of the signal are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.

If we consider a signal in time, the period, ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is analagous to 2''L'' in the above definition. The fundamental frequency is then given by:
::&lt;math&gt;f_0=\frac{1}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt;

And the fundamental angular frequency is then:
::&lt;Math&gt;\omega_0=\frac{2 \pi}{T_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can replace every &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)&lt;/math&gt; term with a more concise &lt;math&gt;(n \omega_0 x)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{info|The fundamental frequency is the repetition frequency of the periodic signal}}

=== Signal Properties ===

Various signal properties translate into specific properties of the Fourier series. If we can identify these properties before hand, we can save ourselves from doing unnecessary calculations.

====DC Offset====
If the periodic signal has a DC offset, then the Fourier Series of the signal will include a ''zero frequency component'', known as the '''DC component'''. If the signal does not have a DC offset, the DC component has a magnitude of 0. Due to the linearity of the Fourier series process, if the DC offset is removed, we can analyse the signal further (e.g. for symmetry) and add the DC offset back at the end.

====Odd and Even Signals====
If the signal is even (symmetric over the reference vertical axis), it is composed of cosine waves. If the signal is odd (anti-symmetric over the reference vertical axis), it is composed out of sine waves. If the signal is neither even nor odd, it is composed out of both sine and cosine waves.

====Discontinuous Signal====
If the signal is discontinuous (i.e. it has &quot;jumps&quot;), the magnitudes of each harmonic ''n'' will fall off proportionally to 1/''n''.

====Discontinuous Derivative====
If the signal is continuous but the derivative of the signal is discontinuous, the magnitudes of each harmonic ''n'' will fall off proportionally to 1/''n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

====Half-Wave Symmetry====
If a signal has half-wave symmetry, there is no DC offset, and the signal is composed of sinusoids lying on only the ''odd harmonics'' (1, 3, 5, etc...). This is important because a signal with half-wave symmetry will require twice as much bandwidth to transmit the same number of harmonics as a signal without:

&lt;math&gt;a_0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{2}{L}\int_0^L f(x) \cos(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{2}{L}\int_0^L f(x) \sin(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Quarter-Wave Symmetry of an Even Signal====
If a 2''L''-periodic signal has quarter-wave symmetry, then it must also be half-wave symmetric, so there are no even harmonics. If the signal is even and has quarter-wave symmetry, we only need to integrate the first quarter-period:

::&lt;math&gt;a_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{4}{L}\int_0^{L/2} f(x) \cos(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

We also know that because the signal is half-wave symmetric, there is no DC offset:

::&lt;math&gt;a_0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Because the signal is even, there are are no sine terms:

::&lt;math&gt;b_n = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Quarter-Wave Symmetry of an Odd Signal====

If the signal is odd, and has quarter wave symmetry, then we can say:

Because the signal is odd, there are no cosine terms:
::&lt;math&gt;a_0=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;a_n=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

There are no even sine terms due to half-wave symmetry, and we only need to integrate the first quarter-period due to quarter-wave symmetry.

::&lt;math&gt;b_n=
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
  \frac{4}{L}\int_0^{L/2} f(x) \sin(n \omega_0 x) dx, &amp; \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd} 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Summary ===

By convention, the coefficients of the cosine components are labeled &quot;''a''&quot;, and the coefficients of the sine components are labeled with a &quot;''b''&quot;. A few important facts can then be mentioned:

*If the function has a DC offset, ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be non-zero. There is no ''B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' term.
*If the signal is even, all the ''b'' terms are 0 (no sine components).
*If the signal is odd, all the ''a'' terms are 0 (no cosine components).
*If the function has half-wave symmetry, then all the even coefficients (of sine and cosine terms) are zero, and we only have to integrate half the signal.
*If the function has quarter-wave symmetry, we only need to integrate a quarter of the signal.
*The Fourier series of a sine or cosine wave contains ''a single harmonic'' because a sine or cosine wave cannot be decomposed into other sine or cosine waves.
*We can check a series by looking for discontinuities in the signal or derivative of the signal. If there are discontinuities, the harmonics drop off as 1/''n'', if the derivative is discontinuous, the harmonics drop off as 1/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Polar Series ==

The Fourier Series can also be represented in a polar form which is more compact and easier to manipulate.

If we have the coefficients of the rectangular Fourier Series, ''a'' and ''b'' we can define a coefficient ''x'', and a phase angle ''&amp;phi;'' that can be calculated in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = a_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_n = \sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b_n}{a_n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can then define ''f(x)'' in terms of our new Fourier representation, by using a '''cosine basis function:'''

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n\cos(n\omega x - \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt;

The use of a cosine basis instead of a sine basis is an arbitrary distinction, but is important nonetheless. If we wanted to use a sine basis instead of a cosine basis, we would have to modify our equation for &amp;phi;, above.

===Proof of Equivalence===

We can show explicitly that the polar cosine basis function is equivalent to the &quot;Cartesian&quot; form with a sine and cosine term.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n\cos(n\omega x - \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt;

By the double-angle formula for cosines:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n \left [ \cos(n\omega x)\cos(-\phi_n)-\sin(n\omega x)\sin(-\phi_n) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

By the odd-even properties of cosines and sines:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n \left [ \cos(n\omega x)\cos(\phi_n)+\sin(n\omega x)\sin(\phi_n) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Grouping the coefficents:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty [x_n \cos(\phi_n) \cos(n\omega x) + x_n \sin(\phi_n)\sin(n\omega x)]&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the rectangular series given that:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n=x_n \cos(\phi_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n=x_n \sin(\phi_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b_n}{a_n}=\frac{x_n \sin(\phi_n)}{x_n \cos(\phi_n)}=\tan(\phi_n)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_n = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{b_n}{a_n} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Squaring and adding, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n^2+b_n^2=x_n^2 \left[ \cos^2(\phi_n) + sin^2(\phi_n) \right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_n^2+b_n^2=x_n^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_n=\sqrt{a_n^2+b_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, given the above definitions of ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the two are equivalent. For a sine basis function, just use the sine double-angle formula. The rest of the process is very similar.

== Exponential Series ==

Using Eulers Equation, and a little trickery, we can convert the standard Rectangular Fourier Series into an exponential form. Even though complex numbers are a little more complicated to comprehend, we use this form for a number of reasons:

#Only need to perform one integration
#A single exponential can be manipulated more easily than a sum of sinusoids
#It provides a logical transition into a further discussion of the Fourier Transform.

We can construct the exponential series from the rectangular series using Euler's formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x)=\frac{-i}{2}\left( e^{ix} - e^{-ix} \right); \quad \quad \cos(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left( e^{ix} + e^{-ix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The rectangular series is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[a_n \cos(n \omega x )+ b_n \sin(n \omega x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting Euler's formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left [ \frac{a_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} + \frac{a_n}{2} e^{- i n \omega x} - \frac{i b_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} + \frac{ib _n}{2} e^{- i n \omega x } \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Splitting into &quot;positive ''n''&quot; and &quot;negative ''n''&quot; parts gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left [ \frac{a_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} - \frac{i b_n}{2} e^{i n \omega x} \right] + 
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} \left [ \frac{a_{-n}}{2} e^{i n \omega x}  + \frac{ib _{-n}}{2} e^{i n \omega x } \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2} (a_n-i b_n) e^{i n \omega x} + 
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-1} \frac{1}{2} (a_{-n}+i b_{-n}) e^{i n \omega x}&lt;/math&gt;

We now collapse this into a single expression:
{{eqn|Exponential Fourier Series}}
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{i n \omega x}&lt;/math&gt;

Where we can relate ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the rectangular series:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2} (a_{-n}+i b_{-n}), &amp; n&lt;0\\
    a_0, &amp; n=0\\
   \frac{1}{2} (a_n-i b_n), &amp; n&gt;0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the exponential Fourier series of ''f(x)''. Note that ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is, in general, complex. Also note that:
:*&lt;math&gt;\Re(c_n)=\Re(c_{-n})&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\Im(c_n)=-\Im(c_{-n})&lt;/math&gt;

We can directly calculate ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a ''2L''-periodic function:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n = \frac{1}{2L} \int_{-L}^{L} f(x) e^{-i n \pi x / L } dx&lt;/math&gt;

This can be related to the ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' definitions in the rectangular form using Euler's formula: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}=\cos{x} + i \sin{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Negative Frequency ==

The Exponential form of the Fourier series does something that is very interesting in comparison to the rectangular and polar forms of the series: it allows for negative frequency components. To this effect, the Exponential series is often known as the &quot;Bi-Sided Fourier Series&quot;, because the spectrum has both a positive and negative side. This, of course, prods the question, &quot;What is a negative Frequency?&quot;

Negative frequencies seem counter-intuitive, and many people would be quick to dismiss them as being nonsense. However, a further study of electrical engineering (which is outside the scope of this book) will provide many examples of where negative frequencies play a very important part in modeling and understanding certain systems. While it may not make much sense initially, negative frequencies need to be taken into account when studying the Fourier Domain.

Negative frequencies follow the important rule of symmetry: For real signals, negative frequency components are ''always'' mirror-images of the positive frequency components. Once this rule is learned, drawing the negative side of the spectrum is a trivial matter once the positive side has been drawn.

However, when looking at a bi-sided spectrum, the effect of negative frequencies needs to be taken into account. If the negative frequencies are mirror-images of the positive frequencies, and if a negative frequency is analogous to a positive frequency, then the effect of adding the negative components into a signal is the same as doubling the positive components. This is a major reason why the exponential Fourier series coefficients are multiplied by one-half in the calculation: because half the coefficient is at the negative frequency.

Note:  The concept of negative frequency is actually unphysical.  Negative frequencies occur in the spectrum only when we are using the exponential form of the Fourier series.  To represent a cosine function, Euler's relationship tells us that there are both positive and negative exponential required.  Why?  Because to represent a real function, like cosine, the imaginary components present in exponential notation must vanish.  Thus, the negative exponent in Euler's formula makes it appear that there are negative frequencies, when in fact, there are not.

=== Example: Ceiling Fan ===

{{TextBox|Another way to understand negative frequencies is to use them for mathematical completeness in describing the physical world. Suppose we want to describe the rotation of a ceiling fan directly above our head to a person sitting nearby. We would say &quot;it rotates at 60 RPM in an anticlockwise direction&quot;. However, if we want to describe its rotation to a person watching the fan from above then we would say &quot;it rotates at 60 RPM in a clockwise direction&quot;. If we customarily use a negative sign for clockwise rotation, then we would use a positive sign for anticlockwise rotation. We are describing the same process using both positive and negative signs, depending on the reference we choose.}}

== Bandwidth ==

Bandwidth is the name for the frequency range that a signal requires for transmission, and is also a name for the frequency capacity of a particular transmission medium. For example, if a given signal has a bandwidth of 10kHz, it requires a transmission medium with a bandwidth of ''at least'' 10kHz to transmit without attenuation.

Bandwidth can be measured in either Hertz or Radians per Second. Bandwidth is only a measurement of the positive frequency components. All real signals have negative frequency components, but since they are only mirror images of the positive frequency components, they are not included in bandwidth calculations.

=== Bandwidth Concerns ===

It's important to note that most periodic signals are composed of ''an infinite sum'' of sinusoids, and therefore require an infinite bandwidth to be transmitted without distortion. Unfortunately, no available communication medium (wire, fiber optic, wireless) have an infinite bandwidth available. This means that certain harmonics will pass through the medium, while other harmonics of the signal will be attenuated.

Engineering is all about trade-offs. The question here is &quot;How many harmonics do I ''need'' to transmit, and how many can I safely get rid of?&quot; Using fewer harmonics leads to reduced bandwidth requirements, but also results in increased signal distortion. These subjects will all be considered in more detail in the future.

=== Pulse Width ===

Using our relationship between period and frequency, we can see an important fact:

:&lt;math&gt;f_0 = \frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

As the period of the signal ''decreases'', the fundamental frequency increases. This means that each additional harmonic will be spaced further apart, and transmitting the same number of harmonics will now require more bandwidth! In general, there is a rule that must be followed when considering periodic signals: ''Shorter periods in the time domain require more bandwidth in the frequency domain. Signals that use less bandwidth in the frequency domain will require longer periods in the time domain.''

==Examples==

=== Example: x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ===

{{TextBox|1=Let's consider a repeating pattern based on a cubic polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;f \left( x \right)=x^3, \quad -\pi \le x &lt; \pi \,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''f(x)'' is 2&amp;pi; periodic:

[[Image:XCubed Periodic (-pi, pi).svg|center]]

By inspection, we can determine some characteristics of the Fourier Series:

*The function is odd, so the cosine coefficients (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') will all be zero.
*The function has no DC offset, so there will be no constant term (''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'').
*There are discontinuities, so we expect a 1/''n'' drop-off.

We therefore just have to compute the ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms. These can be found by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over \pi }\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {f\left( x \right)\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the desired function gives

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over \pi }\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x^3 \sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating by parts,

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over \pi }\left( {\left[ { - x^3 {{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {3x^2 {{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}dx} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Bring out factors:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( {\left[ { - x^3 \cos \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + 3\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x^2 \cos \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute limits into the square brackets and integrate by parts again:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - \left( {\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + \pi ^3 \cos \left( { - n\pi } \right)} \right) + 3\left( {\left[ {x^2 {{\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   - \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {2 x{{\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''cos(x)'' is an even function, so ''cos(-n&amp;pi;) = cos(n&amp;pi;)''. Also bring out the factor of ''1/n'' from the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - \left( {\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + \pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \right) + {3 \over n}\left( {\left[ {x^2 \sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   - 2\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying the left part, and substituting in limits in the square brackets,

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + {3 \over n}\left( {\left( {\pi ^2 \sin \left( {n\pi } \right) - \pi \sin \left( { - n\pi } \right)} \right) - 2\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''sin(n&amp;pi;)'' is always equal to zero for integer ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + {3 \over n}\left( {0 - 2\int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {x\sin \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Bringing out factors and integrating by parts:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over n}\left[ {-\left[ {x{{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {{{\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \over n}dx} } \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over {n^2 }}\left[ -{\left[ {x\cos \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi   + \int\limits_{ - \pi }^\pi  {\cos \left( {nx} \right)dx} } \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Solving the now-simple integral and substituting in limits to the square brackets,

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over {n^2 }}\left[ { - \left( {\pi \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + \pi \cos \left( {-n\pi } \right)} \right) + \left[ {\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]_{-\pi} ^\pi  } \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the area under one cycle of a sine wave is zero, we can eliminate the integral. We use the fact that ''cos(x)'' is even again to simplify:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) - {6 \over {n^2 }}\left[ { - 2\pi \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + 0} \right]} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {1 \over {n\pi }}\left( { - 2\pi ^3 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right) + {{12\pi } \over {n^2 }}\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {{ - 2\pi ^2 \cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \over n} + {{12\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \over {n^3 }}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = \cos \left( {n\pi } \right)\left( {{{ - 2\pi ^2 n^2 } \over {n^3 }} + {{12} \over {n^3 }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {{ - 2\cos \left( {n\pi } \right)} \over {n^3 }}\left( {\pi ^2 n^2  - 6} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, use the fact that ''cos(n&amp;pi;)''=(-1)&lt;sup&gt;''n&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n  = {{ - 2\left( { - 1} \right)^n } \over {n^3 }}\left( {\pi ^2 n^2  - 6} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is our final ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. We see that we have a approximate 1/''n'' relationship (the constant &quot;6&quot; becomes insignificant as ''n'' grows), as we expected. Now, we can find the Fourier approximation according to 

:&lt;math&gt;f\left( x \right) = {1 \over 2}a_0  + \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\left[ {a_n \cos \left( {nx} \right) + b_n \sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

Since all ''a'' terms are zero,

:&lt;math&gt;f\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {b_n \sin \left( {nx} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the Fourier Series approximation of ''f(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;
f\left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\left[ {{{ - 2\left( { - 1} \right)^n } \over {n^3 }}\left( {\pi ^2 n^2  - 6} \right)\sin \left( {nx} \right)} \right]} &lt;/math&gt;

The graph below shows the approximation for the first 7 terms (red) and the first 15 terms (blue). The original function is shown in black.

=== Example: Square Wave ===

{{TextBox|1=We have the following square wave signal, as a function of voltage, traveling through a communication medium:

[[Image:General Square Wave (Odd, Offset).svg|center]]

We will set the values as follows: ''A = 4'' volts, ''T = 1'' second. Also, it is given that the width of a single pulse is ''T/2''.

Find the rectangular Fourier series of this signal.

First and foremost, we can see clearly that this signal does have a DC value: the signal exists entirely above the horizontal axis. DC value means that we will have to calculate our ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''term. Next, we can see that if we remove the DC component (shift the signal downward till it is centered around the horizontal axis), that our signal is an odd signal. This means that we will have ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms, but no ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms. We can also see that this function has discontinuities and half-wave symmetry. Let's recap:

#DC value (must calculate ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'')
#Odd Function (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'' for ''n &gt; 0'')
#Discontinuties (terms fall off as 1/''n'')
#Half-wave Symmetry (no even harmonics)

Now, we can calculate these values as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T f(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^{T/2} 4 dt &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \left[ 4 t \right]_0^{T/2}=\frac{4 \times T}{T \times 2}=2&lt;/math&gt;

This could also have been worked out intuitively, as the signal has a 50% duty-cycle, meaning that the average value is half of the maximum.

Due to the oddness of the function, there are no cosine terms:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 0 \quad \mbox{ for all } n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the half-wave symmetry, there are only odd sine terms, which are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{1}{T/2} \int_0^T f(t) \sin \left( \frac{2 n \pi t}{T} \right) dt &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^{T/2}4 \sin \left( 2 n \pi t \right) dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -2 \left[ \frac{4}{2 n \pi} \cos \left( 2 n \pi t \right) \right]_0^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -2 \left[ \frac{4}{2 n \pi} \cos \left( \frac{2n \pi}{2} \right) - \frac{4}{2 n \pi} \cos \left(2 n \pi \times 0 \right) \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -\frac{4}{n \pi} \left[\cos \left( n \pi \right) - 1 \right] &lt;/math&gt;

Given that cos(''n&amp;pi;'')=(-1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;b_n = -\frac{4 \left((-1)^n - 1 \right)}{n \pi} &lt;/math&gt;

For any even ''n'', this equals zero, in accordance with our predictions based on half-wave symmetry. It also decays as 1/''n'', as we expect, due to the presence of discontinuities.

Finally, we can put our Fourier series together as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty{ b_n \sin \left(\frac {\pi n t}{\frac{L}{2}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = 2 - \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\frac{(-1)^n - 1}{n} \sin(2 \pi n t)}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same as

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = 2 + \frac{8}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,5,\ldots}^\infty{\frac{1}{n} \sin(2 \pi n t)}&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the Fourier series closely matches the original function:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thermodynamics is a misnomer since we will only consider ''equilibrium'' phenomena, not time-dependence like in kinetics. Thermodynamics deals with things like energy, entropy, volume, heat, work, efficiency.  (ideal), free energy, chemical potential, pressure, temperature. It was developed to explain steam engines back in the 1800's. It has come a long way since then, able to explain a vast array of phenomena in chemistry, physics, and biology. It is an old theory, but a beautiful one. It is ''very'' important in chemistry.

'''Sample problem'''

An ideal monoatomic gas at 1 bar is expanded in a reversible adiabatic process to a final pressure of &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; bar. Calculate &lt;math&gt;q\;&lt;/math&gt; per mole, &lt;math&gt;w\;&lt;/math&gt; per mole, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overline{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

To solve this, we need to apply the fact that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left ( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right )^{\gamma - 1 / \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, substitute and solve for &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{298.15\ K} = \left ( \frac{0.5\ bar}{1.0\ bar} \right )^{\begin{matrix} \frac{\begin{matrix} \frac{5}{3} \end{matrix} - 1}{\begin{matrix} \frac{5}{3} \end{matrix}} \end{matrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_2 = {225.96\ K}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we use

&lt;math&gt;w = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \overline{C}_v\, dT&lt;/math&gt;

Which will give us &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w = \int_{298.15\ K}^{225.96\ K} \overline{C}_v\, dT = \begin{matrix} \frac{3}{2} \end{matrix} R \left ( 225.96\ K - 298.15\ K \right ) = -900.39\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we have all of our answers...

Adiabatic means &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overline{U} = w&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;q = 0\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w = -900.39\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\Delta \overline{U} = -900.30\ J\ mol^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

== The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics ==

This law of thermodynamics was developed after the establishment of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The zeroth law is involved in defining temperature.

Let us consider three systems, A, B, and C. If systems A and C are in equilibrium, and B and C are in equilibrium, then A and B will be found to be in thermal equilibrium when connected by a heat conductor. This associative property of systems is the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermodynamic equilibrium seperately with a third system then both these systems are said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other.

'''Stars''' is one of many organization systems in Gmail.
==How to==

You might want to star messages for different reasons - to mark it as über-important, as a temporary filing system, or just for fun.  If you want to &quot;star&quot; a message, there are several ways that you can.  If you are in a mailbox view (i.e. &quot;Inbox,&quot; &quot;All Mail,&quot; &quot;Sent Mail&quot;), then listed on the very left of the subject line is a small white star - the easiest way to star a message?  Simply click on that star, and watch it turn from white to yellow, indicating the change in status from &quot;unstarred&quot; to &quot;starred.&quot;  One can also use this technique when viewing a message (noting that the subject line will have moved to the top of the page).  

If you want to star multiple messages, you can select them using the radio boxes (check boxes) and then select &quot;Add Star&quot; from the drop-down menu at the top of the page.

Unstarring is intuitive once you understand how to star - you can do it by clicking on the yellow star we talked about before, or using the radio boxes (check boxes) and drop down menu.

==Operator== 

You can use the operator '''is:stared''' in your [[Gmail/Filters|filters]] to avoid deleting your starred messages.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Irrevenant. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Irrevenant~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== How to pronounce R in French? ==
The pronunciation is rather difficult for some language speakers. And I cannot find such sound in either English or my native language Chinese. Can anyone give more details on the pronunciation or give a picture of the position of the tongue?

== ==
I just noticed something after insterting the paragraph clarifying the difference in phonological terms on the the [[French/Lessons/Alphabet#b_and_p|English and French 'p' and 'b']]. I don't believe that the voiced labial stop 'b' is ever aspirated in English. In fact, the rule as [[wikipedia:Aspiration_%28phonetics%29|the wikipedia aspiration page]] states it (and as I learned it as well), is &quot;voiceless stops are aspirated when they begin a stressed syllable&quot;. 'B' is voiced and so it shouldn't fall into that category. But I'm not a native speaker and may not have absorbed the rules of English phonology that natives don't even have to think about. Tell me: is there the same difference between between 'pit' and 'spit' as 'bit' and ... well, it's hard to come up with an example. 'sbit'? But that's not a word. We need a word where the 'b' does not begin a  stressed syllable. The 's trick' that works for 'pit' and 'spit' (and 'kill' and 'skill') does not work here since I cannot think of a word with this consonant cluster (I don't think 'disbarred' works because it's syllabized 'dis-barred' and so the 'b' still starts a stressed syllable). Possibly 'dweeb' might work here for comparison with 'bit' since the 'b' ends the syllable instead of beginning it. Suggestions anyone?

I am a native speaker, and when I say &quot;spit&quot; and &quot;sbit&quot; I get the exact same sound. Although sbit isn't a word, I think it demostrates the point quite clearly. So, until we can find a word with an unaspirated B, I think it could be used. [[User:151.213.240.56|151.213.240.56]] 02:14, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== Does &quot;ÿ&quot; and &quot;ö&quot; exist in french? ==

As french native speaker, I don't know any word with those letter modified this way... Maybe I am mistaking but are you sure they exist in modern french? --[[User:Lyndametref|Lyndametref]] 03:27, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

: The lesson on accents says, &quot;The letter ÿ is only used in very rare words, most old town names : L'Haÿ-Les-Roses (Paris surburb).&quot; Don't know about ö. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 04:20, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== ''b'' and ''p'' - pit and spit example ==

I'm having trouble with the pit and spit example, as I'm noticing said &quot;puff&quot; on the second word when the text says it shouldn't. Because of this, I'm not sure if the text there is correct, or if it's a normal method on how I pronounce English words - and as such, I might never meet the requirement of that exercise even if I'm correctly pronouncing &quot;papa&quot;.  --[[Special:Contributions/206.248.132.105|206.248.132.105]] ([[User talk:206.248.132.105|talk]]) 22:55, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

== Punctuation spacing ==
I'm looking for an authoritative style guide on French spacing of punctuation symbols.  I currently found one from Nova Scotia, but I think I need another style guide in order to confirm if this is correct under international French. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 16:22, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

== Usefulness of the h-section ==

Given the general irregularity of french pronounciation, i wonder if telling people about difficulties such as aspirated versus unaspirated h upfront is a good idea. Especially if the exercise is to lookup words in a dictionnary. Just say that as a rule, h is silent, and leave the aspirated bit for later. I'd drop this section, and reintroduce it whenever liaison is introduced, in a section like &quot;liaison and words starting with a vowel&quot;. In the current state, it is as if you introduced ''a'' versus ''an'' to students on their first english lesson, just because they learn how to pronounce the letter ''u''. Likewise, the section on french ''p'' versus english ''p'' seems a bit too frightening: you have to exercise with a piece of paper before you even see the first french sentence?

== Conjugation of habiter Lesson 1.05 ==

My version has tu habite. I believe it should be tu habites.</text>

==Overview: Advanced Topics==

Now that you have learned some of the basics of college writing, it is time to dive into the advanced topics of writing. The tools you have learned from previous sections will help you to be a more successful writer with advanced topics. There are many different reasons for which one writes. It could be for school, work, or even the community. The topics discussed in this section are writing for the humanities, sciences, and business. Each chapter will highlight the unique features that separate these genres and give practical examples of how each uses writing to achieve goals.

===Writing in the Humanities===
Writing in the Humanities includes theoretical writing, creative writing, interpretive writing, and analytical writing.  Each of these qualifies as writing in Humanities, but each uses a significantly different style.

Theoretical writing includes historical and philosophical writing.  This topic focuses on the ideas of past cultures and people.  It also includes writing about your own theories.
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=*Thomas Paine's &quot;Common Sense&quot;&lt;BR&gt; 
*The philosophies of Buddha&lt;BR&gt; 
*Einstein's theories on Nuclear Physics|caption=Sample Theoretical Writings}}

Creative writing uses a more imaginative approach and can include storytelling, personal expression, or even free association.  Poetry, song lyrics, short stories, non-fiction, and fiction novels are all included under creative writing.  In creative writing, there is more freedom for the writer to explore feelings or ideas.  Some forms of creative writing, like sonnets, do include formatting concerns or restrictions.  Creative writing is more concerned with personal expression than adhering to tradition, however. 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=*A science-fiction story&lt;BR&gt; 
*A biography of what the US would have been like if it lost WWII&lt;BR&gt; 
*A story about your future life|caption=Sample Creative Writings}}

Interpretive writers do more than simply summarize the text they study.  Interpretive writing improves understanding by asking a series of good questions. The interpretive writer introduces their own ideas about a text, but they must always back up claims by referring to the text they analyze, or another appropriate source.

Analytical writing is much like interpretive writing, but also goes a bit further.  Not only will you provide information, but you will also analyze it.  This includes asking “how” and “why.”  You will need to take a critical approach to develop an understanding of the topic before writing about it.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Writing in the Humanities|This chapter]] will expand on the differences of theoretical, creative, interpretive, and analytical writing, and will share tips on how to write successfully while using those different approaches.

===Writing in  the Sciences===
Writing in the sciences focuses on informing the reader of new discoveries, and assisting readers in discovering truth through facts.  This form of writing should not leave anything open to interpretation by the reader.  Information should be presented with solid data given in detail.  Science writing is generally written in past tense and should be concise.  Common forms of science writing includes lab reports and literature reviews.

Writing in science includes two main categories: natural sciences and social sciences.  Natural sciences include pure science and applied science.  Pure sciences are life sciences, physical sciences, and earth sciences.  Applied sciences include medical sciences, engineering sciences, and computer science.

Social sciences focus on human behavior and societies.  Social sciences involve documenting actual events as they happen as with case studies.  Categories of social science include psychology, anthropology, political science, sociology, education, business, and economics.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=*  Story regarding global warming&lt;BR&gt; 
*  Story based on the research of estrogen&lt;BR&gt;|caption=Sample Scientific Writings}}



[[Rhetoric and Composition/Writing in the Sciences|This chapter]] will explain the distinct features of writing for the sciences.

===Writing in Business===

Business writing has a practical bent to it.  Writing in business often means explaining a situation, event, or change.  The author typically has a very specific action they wish the audience to take, and that action often contains time concerns as well.

Good business writing is concise and focuses directly on the stated purpose.  A business document needs to be organized in a manner that directs a reader's eye to the most important points.  A well-written business document should allow the reader to quickly scan for purpose, time constraints, and a contact person who can answer further questions.  

Writing in business can include: memos, cover letters, resumes, project reports, proposals, thank-you letters, emails, and business plans.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Writing in Business|This chapter]] will give you the techniques needed to build a resume as well as many important documents used in a business setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ToonTalk==
Ken Kahn invented and implemented ToonTalk and proposes it for children.  It is available for free from [http://www.toontalk.com the ToonTalk web site] to run under Windows on Intel-type architecture.  I don't know whether anyone has tried it on a Windows emulator over a Unix-like system.
===Type===
ToonTalk has fine-grained concurrency and arguably a declarative interpretation, as a concurrent constraint (logic) language.  Arguments are objects, not in the &quot;object-oriented&quot; programming sense of &quot;object&quot;, but in the more everyday sense in that if I hand you an object, I don't have it anymore.
===Execution Entry Point===
The programmer triggers execution by performing a manipulation.  There is no particular place to which this is limited.
===General Syntax===
ToonTalk's syntax is animation, as in cartoons.  The programmer takes on a persona and shows ''robots'' what to do by example.  The programmer (or a robot) can assemble robots into teams of robots.  Giving a team a ''box'' (an array/tuple container) starts a process.  Order matters in the team.  On each execution cycle of the process, the robots in sequence attempt to match a pattern (one pattern per robot) to the box.  The first match fires.

The programmer or a robot can put an object in a &quot;hole&quot; (compartment) in a box, or can take it out.  You may regard this as similar to assignment.  Holes can be empty.

A magic wand is available to copy things, and a vacuum cleaner is available to make things go away.

There is one reference and communication structure, consisting of bird/nest pairs (or families).  A bird flies to a nest, in the simplest case (it is also possible to have multiple birds fly to the same nest, one bird fly to multiple nests, or multi-to-multi, but for this description, I'll continue assuming the simplest communication).  When the programmer or a robot gives an object to a bird, the bird (she; all birds are female and all robots are male) flies to her nest and deposits the object there.  If there are any objects already on the nest, the bird puts the new object underneath them.

When a robot is waiting for an object of a particular type to be in a hole in a box, if there is in fact an uncovered nest in that hole, the robot waits until a bird should put something on the nest.  Then, the box appears to the robot as though the delivered object were there instead of the nest.  Consequently, you can pass structures (as boxes with possible nested boxes) with, in effect, parameters whose values are not known yet, represented as nests.  When another part of the program figures out what the value of the parameter should be, it can hand an object representing that value to the bird that flies to the nest in question.

You may regard handing an object to a bird as similar to assignment.

Actually, I lied; the bird and nest is not the only reference structure.  There are also &quot;sensor&quot; objects linked to other objects as their &quot;looks&quot;, and changes to one are immediately reflected in the other.  These can't be boxes, however, just text, numbers, or pictures.  I consider sensors dirty in the sense that assignments are dirty in Lisp and you can think of &quot;pure Lisp&quot; as a dialect free of this dirt.  However, the sensors seem to be necessary in ToonTalk practice as part of an output mechanism (animated &quot;pictures&quot;) that would be awkward to drive with birds; Dr. Kahn experimented with having birds as the only I/O and eventually switched to using the sensors.

===Comments===
The programmer or a robot can type labels on holes, birds and nests, and robots.  The labels have no effect on execution, but can help the programmer very much to remember what the holes are for in the design.  Also, the reportoire of objects includes &quot;notebooks&quot; on which it is common practice to write documentation as text pads placed on the left page to document whatever object is stored on the right page that follows.  A notebook as a whole can also be labeled.

===Variable Declarations===
A box has a number of holes.  You can put any object in a hole that is not already occupied.  You can also hand a &quot;rectangular&quot; object (such as a box, a number pad, or a text pad) to a bird.  The presence of the hole or bird could be said to constitute a declaration of a variable.  The logic behind such a thought would argue that you can think of putting an object in a hole as assigning a value, and so the hole represents the potentiality to determine that value, and that is what a variable fundamentally is; it's an entity whose value we may not know yet, but to which a value can be assigned once we have figured out what it ought to be.  From this viewpoint, the value of a bird could be thought of as the sequence of objects that will eventually be given to the bird.

On the other hand, if we choose to think of any object in ToonTalk that gets modified as two distinct objects, the one before the modification and the version after, then we can see the language as declarative and so of course there are no assignments nor variables to declare, except logical variables, and a bird/nest pair could be thought of as a logical variable.  When you extract the bird/nest pair from Tooly the Toolbox, you are declaring the variable.

It's a matter of viewpoint.

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
There is a &quot;toolbox&quot; (really a supplies box) available to the programmer and all robots in all contexts.  The programmer takes a fresh robot from the toolbox and hands it an example box.  Each robot sports, at all times, a comic-book style &quot;thought bubble&quot;, which reveals what pattern the robot would try to match (always a box) (a fresh robot has a thought bubble without any box in it; this is referred to as a &quot;robot without a thought&quot;).  The programmer (in this case, a robot can't do this) gives an example box to a fresh robot as just taken from Tooly, the toolbox (the tools all have cute names; the magic wand is Maggie and the vacuum cleaner is Dusty).  The animation then expands the robot's thought bubble to fill the screen.  It is populated with a copy of the example box, and with the toolbox, and with an image of the robot that is connected to the mouse as its cursor.  The programmer uses this cursor to act out what the robot should do every time it fires.  To finish up writing the method, the programmer has two choices exactly.  One is to hit the ESC key.  When the robot executes this action, the process of which it is a part continues in existence and proceeds to its next cycle of execution.  The other exit syntax is to pick up a bomb and explode it.  This destroys the process when executed.  Note that the programming session is not an execution, except in a limited sense that calculations on the visible objects will have their results evident.

After the programmer has thus specified the robot's actions (or body or tail as I would call it, thinking of the robot as a rule in a logical language), the programmer (or a robot, I think) can generalize the robot's pattern to the degree required by the software design.
===Scope===
Robots can manipulate the objects that are convenient to hand.  The robot finds these objects in its &quot;My Box&quot; and can temporarily put them on the floor.  &quot;My Box&quot; can also be manipulated (e. g. given to a bird).

Robots do not wander around.

There are three forms of action at a distance.  One is the bird/nest mechanism already described above.  The second is the spawning of new processes.  A third involves special &quot;sensor&quot; objects that have immediate effects on their remote correspondents; I don't like to talk about them; they're dirty.

When a robot or the programmer hands a message (any &quot;rectangular&quot; object) to a bird, after the bird delivers the object to her nest, the bird flies back, and it is possible to hand her additional messages, or to pass her off to somebody else who can do so (e. g. by putting her in a hole in a box and handing the box to another bird).

===Conditional Statements===
The only conditions are those that are checked by the robot pattern matching mechanism described above.  The body of a robot is straght-line code with no conditions, loops, or subroutine calls.  Thus no stack is required for execution, and the time to fire a robot is predictable and short.

Patterns can directly check object type (e. g., number, string, N-hole box (with possible pattern constraints on what can be in the holes), box generally without regard to number of holes, bird, empty nest) and can check for constant values of numbers and strings (thus a string can serve as a message selector).  To do magnitude comparisons (&lt;, &gt;), it is necessary to employ a balance.  The balance compares two numbers or strings that are on either side of it in a box, and a pattern can look for a balance in a given aspect of tilt (less than, equal, or greater than).

===Looping Statements===
Each process that does not blow up is always in a loop.  Recursion is also possible by spawning additional processes, which can contain a copy of the robot team that spawns them, or any other robot team.  There is no other looping mechanism.  In particular, as mentioned above, the body of a robot is staight-line.
===Output Statements===
Suppose you have been given a bird, and your understanding is that you are to use that bird as your output channel.  Then extract a text pad from Tooly.  While holding or pointing to the text pad, hit the backspace key to get rid of the &quot;A&quot; that is there (all fresh text pads have the single character &quot;A&quot; on them).  Then type &quot;Hello world.&quot;  Press enter if you would like to include a carriage return.  Hand the modified text pad to the bird.

There are also &quot;pictures&quot;, which can have robots on the back of them executing as processes and causing the picture to change appearence (including showing text) using sensor objects associated with the picture.  The programmer may thus animate characters.

The programmer can travel around the system and observe any process or object, and manipulate them besides.
===Containers===
The native container is the box.  A box is a linear arrangement of zero to 64K - 1 holes.  A hole can contain any object or be empty.  Note that a box can contain another box.  Boxes can be appended to each other or broken up.  The zero-hole box is possible and useful.

Note that a list structure can be built of two-hole boxes.  This differs from a Lisp list in that no objects can be shared between lists (except, in effect, birds and nests).

Note that processes can be used to contain things (every process centers around a single box, called &quot;My Box&quot;), and linked structures can be built up of processes communicating via birds and nests.

===Algorithms===
Algorithms tend to be recursive.
===Garbage collection===
There is '''no''' automatic garbage collection.  Each process (except the ones on the backs of pictures) occupies a &quot;house&quot;.  The programmer is responsible to decide when these are no longer needed and arrange for them to blow themselves up.
===Physical Structure===
The dynamic space for systems being run and modified by a user/programmer is called a &quot;city&quot;.  A city consists of a 2-d array of city blocks with streets and avenues running between them.  Four houses can be built on each block.  A helicopter is available to give the programmer an overview and to support quick movement around the city.  On entering a house (on foot), the programmer can observe the contents, which is usually a process.  A programmer can also leave objects around in houses (or even on the grass outside, but this is not very useful, as not all manipulations will work from there).  Processes are blind to whatever a programmer may have left in their respective houses, and an execution cycle of a process cannot leave anything behind, either (other than &quot;My Box&quot; and its contents).  When a process spawns another process, this is done by the robot extracting a fresh ''truck'' from Tooly (it looks like a toy truck) and placing on it a team of robots (a single robot is really a one-robot team, and there is no way to construct a zero-robot team) and a box.  As soon as the truck is loaded with both these ojects and is sitting on the floor of the house, it drives away.  Once outside, it grows to the size of a real truck (so it appears in the animation, anyway) and drives around looking for a place to build a house.  An invisible crew of house builders emerges from the truck and builds the house very quickly.  The truck then shrinks to toy size again and drives into the house.  The truck then disappears, leaving the team of robots to work on the box.

It is possible for the programmer to save a city on a Windows file, and to resume execution with a copy of that city.  It is possible for the programmer to export or import any object (the export format is XML).  There are long-distance birds that can fly over the Internet to different running instances of ToonTalk.  There are &quot;notebooks&quot; that hold copies of objects on their pages (which can include notebooks).  Every programmer has a principal notebook, which is persisted between ToonTalk sessions.  It is here that one usually saves robots as soon as they are defined.  These mechanisms, with the exception of the long-distance birds, are only available to the programmer by direct manipulation; robots cannot do them.  Robots have no access to a persistency mechanism except through &quot;foreign birds&quot; (not to be confused with long-distance birds), which constitute the interface between languages.
===Tips===
&lt;Please include tips that make it easier to switch to this language from another language.&gt;

It may be best not to have been exposed to other programming languages.

But some basic computer science still applies.  Recursion is still recursion, and data structures are still data structures.

If you want to program with a stack, you can make your own.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While technically not part of iLife, this feature on all Macs that came with an Apple Remote, lets you enjoy your media from your sofa.

==The Front Row Remote==
Front Row is a feature on some of Apple's latest Macs that lets you control certain functions of iLife from your sofa using a special remote. This remote is a curvy white rectangle reminiscent of the iPod shuffle and the now-defunct iPod mini. It has only six buttons on it: Play/Pause, +, -, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, and MENU.

==Getting around Front Row==
To show Front Row, press the MENU button on your remote. Your Mac desktop flies away into the background and four gargantuan icons rotate into place. Pressing MENU again hides Front Row and brings you back to your desktop, exactly the way you left it.

====Correction?====

Isn't 

 do k = 1 repeat 2*i until (k &amp;gt; 1000); 

supposed to be

 do k = 1 repeat 2*k until (k &amp;gt; 1000); 

with the variable k beeing used within the repeat statement?

=== Request of Discussion ===
I've decided to write some basic information about bit (1) strings into the main article and to put advanced information into a new &quot;special&quot; articel.
About my motivation:
* I think the main article should contain basic information which enables reader to read/write PL/I programs, it shouldn't by a huge collection of very special information.
* Simple boolean variables and NOT/AND/OR are programming fundamentals needed for programs more complex than &quot;Hello World&quot;.
* By my experience bit (n), n &gt; 1 and BOOL/ALL/ANY are useful but there are many applications programmers they never needed it.
Well, that's my point of view, I'd like to read how other people think about this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note:  All assembly language sample code depends on the developing environment assembler and operating system.''
==Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11==
Here is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11 wikipedia entry].
===Type===
CISC
===Execution Entry Point===
On Unix, execution of a program would begin at the first word.  The Unix &quot;a.out&quot; format (assembler output) had a header, and the first word of the header, 407 octal, was a branch around the rest of the header.  By Fifth Edition Unix, the header did not actually get loaded in the execution image, so the 407 octal did not have to be executed; however, the &quot;magic number&quot; 0407 (octal) stuck as part of a.out format, even as the format moved to other computer architectures.
===Registers===
There were eight 16-bit registers, addressed by three bits in addressing modes in instructions.  Register 7 was the program counter and register 6 was the stack pointer.  Registers zero through 5 were general-purpose.  The stack grew downward.

Addressing modes included postincrement and predecrement.  A popular myth assumes these to be the source of the increment and decrement operators in C, but in fact those were inherited from B, which was implemented before the PDP-11 existed.

A consequence of the fact that the PC was addressed as an ordinary register, and of the inclusion of the postincrement addressing mode, was that you could load a literal value into a register (or send it to memory, for that matter) by having the literal follow the instruction in memory.

        mov (PC)+, R5
        177265

would put 177265 octal in register 5.  In the assembler (using Unix assembler syntax here), you could abbreviate this as

        mov $177265, R5

===General Syntax===
In the Unix assembler, a colon followed each label.

 foo:   mov -(PC), -(PC)   / copy this instruction to the previous
                           / location and branch there
        br foo             / branch to foo

Of course in the above example, the branch to foo would not have to be executed since the instruction before it is a (nasty) loop unto itself.

Instruction fields occurred on three-bit boundaries starting from the low-order side, so it was easy to remember some instructions and the addressing modes for programming in binary from the front-panel switches.  For instance, machine language for

        mov -(PC), -(PC)

was 01x7x7 octal, where I forget what x was but it denoted the addressing mode, predecrement, each 7 denotes the PC, and the 01 is the opcode for move (which means copy).  These field boundaries did not hold for the branch instructions, however.

===Comments===
At least one of the assemblers (the DEC?) allowed comments delimited with a semicolon to end of line. In the Unix Assembler the character &quot;/&quot; was used instead. &lt;ref&gt;Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, Chapter 2 - Unix Assembler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interrupts===
The processor status word (PSW) was addressed at a specific memory-mapped location (-2, I believe).  The interrupt vectors were in low memory.  An interrupt would push the return address on the stack, and something else, because the format for an interrupt differed from that of a subroutine call, because there was a return-from-interrupt instruction distinct from the normal return (from subroutine) instruction.
===Conditional Statements===
There were branches, which went to short relative addresses, and jump instructions, which could go to any address using any addressing mode.  Only branches could be conditional, in which case they would depend on condition codes set by a previous compare or arithmetic instruction.  I forget whether there was a &quot;branch never&quot;.  There was a &quot;wait&quot;, which would wait until the next interrupt, and a &quot;halt&quot;, which would give control to the console (if executed in kernel mode or on a machine without protection).

       cmp r0, (r1)        / compare the contents of register R0 to
                           / what R1 points to in memory (two-byte word)
       bne foo             / branch not equal, to foo
===Input/Output===
Devices were memory mapped in high addresses.  You could use interrupts or polling to know when they were ready.  There were several levels of interrupt (or bus request).

There was a graphical computer called the GT40, before raster graphics became ''de rigeur''.  It had a computing processor that was a PDP-11, and a coprocessor to do the vectoring graphics.  The graphic processor had its own jump instruction and would be put in a loop to keep the screen refreshed.  There were great lunar lander and space war programs.

User programs on Unix, of course, did I/O with system calls, which were trap instructions.

 stdout = 1
 .data
 msg:   &lt;Hello, world.\n&gt;
 .code
        sys write; stdout; msg; 14.   / is the length
        / don't bother checking for error or a write of less than
        / the full buffer.
        sys exit; 0                   / exit with an OK status

I'm not certain whether the exit status followed the &quot;sys exit&quot; as above, or whether it was in r0.

        clr r0
        sys exit

Since the arguments to system calls usually followed the trap instructions in memory, and the arguments often should be variable, and you can't write reentrant code if there are variables mixed in your executable code, Unix provided the &quot;sys indir&quot; call which could point to a system call in data space, which Unix would interpret as though it had occurred inline.
===Indirection===
&lt;How many layers of address indirection are allowed?  Show example code.&gt;

One layer of indirection, determined by the instruction.  You could index by a literal following the instruction.
===Physical Structure===
&lt;Describe how the files, libararies, and parts are typically divided and arranged.  Do they have typical file extensions in the various forms?&gt;

On Unix, assembly language usually used the .s extention (for &quot;source&quot;).  The result of assembly was called a.out unless you told the assembler otherwise, in which case the convention was to use a .o suffix (for &quot;object&quot;).  Typically the linker &quot;ld&quot; (for &quot;loader&quot;) would be run on a bunch of .o files to produce the new a.out, which you could then cause the execution of by just typing its name.
===Useful Commands===
&lt;List code and descriptions of particularly useful commands for this assembly language.&gt;

There were, in both the Unix and DEC assemblers, nonce labels.  Rather than make up a name for every label you needed, you could just use a number and reach it locally.

 1:    cmp r3, r4           / hit size limit yet?
       bge 2f
       mov (r0)+, (r1)+
       inc r3
       br 1b
 2:

In the Unix assembler, 2f meant 2 forward (the next &quot;2:&quot;) and 1b meant 1 back, and so on.

Jumps could jump farther than branches, but took up two words, so a branch was desirable if possible.  The assemblers provided a way to code a branch if it could reach and a jump otherwise.  You could write it conditional, in which case the assembler would output a branch around a jump if necessary (inverting the condition, of course).

      jle foo                 / jump to foo if less or equal
      jbr bar                 / jump or branch to bar

The PDP-11 ia one of the original mini-computers.  It was used in a huge variety of ways, from timesharing to embedded control as well as some desktop use.  PDP-11 is not a language per se, but PDP-11 assembly is a flavor of assembly.
This early machine's architecture influenced later microprocessors and because it affected the design of the machine native code, it also affected higher level languages.

The postincrement addressing also made it into the Motorola 6800.

The only reason you would want to learn the PDP-11 assembly language would be if you had acquired a working PDP-11 machine and wanted to write or modify programs running on it.  The machine, PDP-11, as well as every machine that ran it native is obsolete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The step filter updates its output value only if the input value changed by a significant amount, specified by the threshold input. Incoming values thus update in &quot;steps&quot;.

Sometimes a reaktor module sends out a lot of events with the same value, which you can't really see. In the case you want to trigger something each time the output changes its value, you have to use a stepfilter with a threshold of 0 to filter out the events with the same value.

L3 is a loop-based sample transformer. You can modifying the sound of loaded loops using different sound effects using a step-sequencer. These modifications, which are grouped into patterns (from A to H), can also be sequenced. 

Each pattern consists of a number of step-sequenced sound modifications. Each step represents a 1/16 note. The sound parameters that can be modified are offset inside the sample, gain, panning, pitch, reversing a portion of the sample, rolling (stutter effect) a portion of the sample, and modifying the attack and the decay of the sample portion.

The ensemble can be separated into two big units, the sequencer unit and the audio unit. Roughly, these units are separated into the modules &quot;Seq V5&quot; (pattern sequencer), &quot;Editor&quot; (pattern editor/sound parameter sequencer) for the sequencer unit, and &quot;Engine&quot; for the audio unit.

=== Seq V5 ===

SeqV5 is, according to its comment, a sequencer built by [[http://www.lost-online.com|James Walker-Hall]]. It is the part of the L3 ensemble that sequences the patterns, and handles the pattern length. On the L3 panel, it is the top bar with the pattern names on top, and crosses underneath the activated patterns, as well as the bar and beats-per-bar scale value field on the left. It has no input port (except the mysterious inactive &quot;*&quot;), and outputs the pattern length in 96th (port 96L), the current pattern number (port #), the current position inside the current pattern in 96th (port 96P), as well as the same information in 16th, which isn't used in the L3 ensemble.

SeqV5 consists of 4 modules. &quot;Time&quot; handles the bars and beat-per-bars inputs, and outputs the length of the pattern in 96th. It somehow involves the number of voices of the instrument, which is locked to 32. The maximum number of bars is voices module beats-per-bar, which is kind of obscure. &quot;96P&quot; handles the midi clock information and the pattern sequencer, and outputs the current bar, whether the module is playing, and the position in 96th inside the active pattern. &quot;Pattern&quot; handles the pattern sequencer, and outputs the number of current pattern according to the information out of &quot;96P&quot;. &quot;16P&quot; transforms the 96th time into 16th time.

&quot;96P&quot; determines the current pattern and the sequences of pattern inside a macro &quot;Loop&quot;, which interprets the mouse-area messages over the pattern sequencer. The Mouse macro converts the 0-1 X coordinate of the mouse area to a value from 1 to 16, and passes the mouse clicks to the loop area macro. This macro catches the x-coordinate of the mouse on the first click, and merges this first x-coordinate with future coordinates (moving the mouse with the button pressed). These coordinates are sorted, and the resulting range is the active pattern range in the pattern sequencer.
The LLd and LSd outputs are used for the display of the selected range, while LL and LS are the actual outputs. They get triggered when a snapshot is recalled or when the mouse is released.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Feminism is a diverse collection of social theories, political movements, and moral philosophies, largely motivated by or concerning the experiences of women, especially in terms of their social, political, and economic situation. As a social movement, feminism largely focuses on limiting or eradicating gender inequality and promoting women's rights, interests, and issues in society.

Within academia, some feminists focus on documenting gender inequality and changes in the social position and representation of women. Others argue that gender, and even sex, are social constructs, and research the construction of gender and sexuality, and develop alternate models for studying social relations.

Some feminist scholars consider the essence of feminism as broader than male and female relations. It has been posited that the hierarchies in businesses and government and all organizations need to be done away with and replaced with a decentralized ultra-democracy. Some argue that the concept of having any central leader in any organization is a concept derived from the male-centric family structure (and therefore in need of reform and replacement). (See [[w:Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-Feminism]] and [[w:Post-structuralism|Post-structuralism]])

Feminist scholarship is interdisciplinary, drawing on fields of study such as anthropology, legal theory, sociology, history, literature and media studies among others. Feminist Studies, Women's Studies, or Gender Studies may be their own academic departments at some universities, while at others courses that use a feminist analysis may be taught through other departments, such as any of those listed above or another department with an explicitly political bent, such as Ethnic Studies, LGBT Studies, or Queer Studies. There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not the needs of students and of the field are best served by teaching about women's issues, racism, homophobia, and other interconnected issues in departments specifically devoted to such study or as single courses through a variety of more traditional departments such as Literature, History, etc. &lt;ref&gt;Lee, Rachel. “Notes from the (Non) Field: Teaching and Theorizing Women of Color.” &lt;u&gt;Women's Studies on Its Own: A Next Wave Reader in Institutional Change&lt;/u&gt;. Ed. Robyn Wiegman. Durham: Duke University Press, 2002. 82-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moallem, Minoo. ““Women of Color in the U.S.”: Pedagogical Reflections on the Politics of the “Name”.” &lt;u&gt;Women's Studies on Its Own: A Next Wave Reader in Institutional Change&lt;/u&gt;. Ed. Robyn Wiegman. Durham: Duke University Press, 2002. 368-382.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist political activists often campaign on issues such as reproductive rights, violence within a domestic partnership, maternity leave, equal pay, sexual harassment, discrimination, and sexual violence. Themes explored in feminism include patriarchy, stereotyping, objectification, sexual objectification, and oppression.

In the 1960s and 1970s, much of feminism and feminist theory largely represented, and was concerned with, problems faced by Western, white, heterosexual, middle-class women while at the same time claiming to represent all women through a theory of universal patriarchy and worldwide sisterhood. Since that time, many feminist theorists have challenged the assumption that &quot;women&quot; constitute a homogeneous group of individuals with identical interests. Feminist activists emerge from within diverse communities, and feminist theorists have begun to focus on the intersection between gender and sexuality with other social identities, such as race and class. Many feminists today argue that feminism is a grass-roots movement that seeks to cross boundaries based on social class, race, culture, and religion. Feminisms are culturally specific and addresses issues relevant to the women of each society, such as female circumcision in Sudan, or the glass ceiling in developed economies. There is an ongoing debate about the extent to which certain issues, such as rape, incest, and mothering, are universal, and under what circumstances feminists can and should intervene in other countries and form alliances with activists from other backgrounds, in light of histories of colonialism and globalization that can render forming truly helpful international projects rather difficult.

Over the years a number of feminist political parties have been formed. Although negative stereotypes about feminists are still quite common, feminism and women's rights are often subjects of mainstream or even conservative political rhetoric, as when Laura Bush used the concept of women's rights in a critique of the Middle East in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/22/world/fg-laura22|&quot;Laura Bush Emphasizes Women's Rights at Convention in Jordan&quot;, Los Angeles Times] accessed April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of feminism reaches far back before the 18th century, but the seeds of the feminist movement were planted during the latter portion of that century. The earliest works on the so-called &quot;woman question&quot; criticised the restrictive role of women, without necessarily claiming that women were disadvantaged or that men were to blame.

=== Prior to 1850 ===
Feminist thought began during The Enlightenment with such thinkers as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and the Marquis de Condorcet championing women's education. The first scientific society for women was founded in Middleberg, a city in the south of the Dutch republic, in 1785. Journals for women which focused on issues like science became popular during this period as well. Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society, coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth, does not sound like a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft believed that both sexes contributed to this situation and took it for granted that women had considerable power over men.

=== Late 19th century ===
The movement is generally said to have begun in the 18th century as people increasingly came to believe that women were treated unfairly under the law. The feminist movement is rooted in the West and especially in the reform movement of the 19th century. The organised movement is dated from the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848.

Emmeline Pankhurst was one of the founders of the suffragette movement and aimed to reveal the institutional sexism in British society, forming the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Often the repeated jailing for forms of activism that broke the law, particularly property destruction, inspired members to go on hunger strikes. As a result of the resultant force-feeding that was the practice, these members became very ill, serving to draw attention to the brutality of the legal system at the time and to further their cause. In an attempt to solve this the government introduced a bill that became known as the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed women to be released when they starved themselves to dangerous levels, then to be re-arrested later.

Other notable 19th-century feminists include, Emma Goldman, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Margaret Sanger.

The Feminist movement in the Arab world saw Egyptian jurist Qasim Amin, the author of the 1899 pioneering book Women's Liberation (Tahrir al-Mar'a), as the father of Arab Feminist Movement. In his work Amin criticized some of the practices prevalent in his society at the time, such as polygamy, the veil, or women's segregation, and condemned them as un-Islamic, and contradicting the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and Arab world, and is read and cited today. Less known, however, are the women who preceded Amin in their feminist critique of their societies. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.

=== 20th century ===
Many countries began to grant women the vote in the early years of the 20th century, especially in the final years of the First World War and the first years after the war. The reasons for this varied, but included a desire to recognise the contributions of women during the war, and were also influenced by rhetoric used by both sides at the time to justify their war efforts. For example, since Wilson's Fourteen Points recognised self determination as a vital component of society, the hypocrisy of denying half the population of modern nations the vote became difficult for men to ignore. (See: Women's suffrage)

The 1920s were an important time for women, who, in addition to gaining the vote also gained legal recognition in many countries. However, in many countries, women lost the jobs they had gained during the war. In fact, women who had held jobs prior to the war were sometimes compelled to give up their jobs to returning soldiers, partly due to a conservative backlash, and partially through societal pressure to reward the soldiers. Many women continued to work in blue collar jobs, on farms, and traditionally female occupations. Women did make strides in some fields such as nursing.

In both World Wars, manpower shortages brought women into traditionally male occupations, ranging from munitions manufacturing and mechanical work to a female baseball league. By demonstrating that women could do &quot;men's work&quot;, and highlighting society's dependence on their labour, this shift encouraged women to strive for equality. In World War II, the popular icon Rosie the Riveter became a symbol for a generation of working women.

The rise of socialism and communism advanced the rights of women to economic parity with men in some countries. Women were often encouraged to take their place as equals in these societies, although they rarely enjoyed the same level of political power as men, and still often faced very different social expectations.

In some areas, regimes actively discouraged feminism and women's liberations. In Nazi Germany, a very hierarchical society was idealized where women maintained a position largely subordinate to men. Women's activism was very difficult there, and in other societies that deliberately set out to restrict women's, and men's, gender roles, such as Italy, and much later Afghanistan.

Early feminists and primary feminist movements are often called the first wave and feminists after about 1960 the second wave. Second wave feminists were concerned with gaining full social and economic equality, having already gained almost full legal equality in many western nations. One of the main fields of interest to these women was in gaining the right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s. With the development of the birth control pill feminists hoped to make it as available as possible. Many hoped that this would free women from the perceived burden of mothering children they did not want; they felt that control of reproduction was necessary for full economic independence from men. Access to abortion was also widely demanded, but this was much more difficult to secure because of the deep societal divisions that existed over the issue. To this day, abortion remains controversial in many parts of the world.

Many feminists also fought to change perceptions of female sexual behaviour. Since it was often considered more acceptable for men to have multiple sexual partners, many feminists encouraged women into &quot;sexual liberation&quot; and having sex for pleasure with multiple partners. The extent to which most women in fact changed their behaviour, first of all because many women had already slept with multiple partners, and secondly because most women still remained in mainly monogamous relationships, is debatable. However, it seems clear that women becoming sexually active since the 1980s are relatively more sexually active than previous generations. (See: Sexual revolution)

These developments in sexual behavior have not gone without criticism by some feminists. They see the sexual revolution primarily as a tool used by men to gain easy access to sex without the obligations entailed by marriage and traditional social norms. They see the relaxation of social attitudes towards sex in general, and the increased availability of pornography without stigma, as leading towards greater sexual objectification of women by men. Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin gained notoriety in the 1980s by attempting to classify pornography as a violation of women's civil rights.

There is a so called third wave, but feminists disagree as to its necessity, its benefits, and its ideas. Often also called &quot;Post-Feminist,&quot; it can possibly be considered to be the advancement of a female discourse in a world where the equality of women is something that can be assumed—rather than fought for.

=== Recent activities ===
In many areas of the world women are still paid less than men for equivalent work, hold much less political and economic power, and are often the subject of intense social pressure to conform to relatively traditional gender expectations. Feminists continue to fight these conditions. The most high profile work is done in the field of pay-equity, reproductive rights, and encouraging women to become engaged in politics, both as candidates and as voters. In some areas feminists also fight for legislation guaranteeing equitable divorce laws and protections against rape and sexual harassment. Radical feminism was a significant development in second wave feminism, viewing women's oppression as a fundamental element in human society and seeks to challenge that standard by broadly inverting perceived gender roles along with promoting lesbian and gay rights.

In the Arab and Islamic world, feminist movements face very different challenges. In Morocco and Iran, for example, it is the application of Islamic personal status laws that are the target of feminist activity. According to Islamic law, for example, a woman who remarries may lose custody over her children; divorce is an unqualified male privilege; in certain countries polygamy is still legal. While not attacking Islamic law itself, these women and men in different Islamic countries offer modern, feminist, egalitarian readings of religious texts. In Egypt feminist gynecologist Nawal al-Sa'dawi centers her critique on the still-prevalent custom of female genital mutilation. Feminist groups in other African countries have targeted the practice as well.

One problem feminists have encountered in the late 20th century is a strong backlash against perceived zealotry on their part. This backlash may be due to the visibility of some radical feminist activism that has been inaccurately perceived as representing the feminist movement as a whole. Many women, and some men, have become reluctant to be identified as feminists for this reason. Outside of the West, feminism is often associated with Western colonialism and Western cultural influence, and is therefore often delegitimized. Feminist groups therefore often prefer to refer to themselves as &quot;women's organizations&quot; and refrain from labeling themselves feminists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some forms of feminist theory question basic assumptions about gender, gender difference, and sexuality, including the category of &quot;woman&quot; itself as a holistic concept, further some are interested in questioning the male/female binary completely (offering instead a multiplicity of genders). Other forms of feminist theory take for granted the concept of &quot;woman&quot; and provide specific analyzes and critiques of gender inequality, and most feminist social movements promote women's rights, interests, and issues. Feminism is not a single ideology. Over-time several sub-types of feminist ideology have developed. Early feminists and primary feminist movements are often called the first-wave feminists, and feminists after about 1960 the second-wave feminists. More recently, a new generation of feminists have started third-wave feminism. Whether this will be a lasting evolution remains to be seen as the second-wave has by no means ended nor has it ceded to the third-wave feminists. Moreover, some commentators have asserted that the silent majority of modern feminists have more in common ideologically with the first-wave feminists than the second-wave. For example, many of the ideas arising from Radical feminism and Gender feminism (prominent second-wave movements) have yet to gain traction within the broader community and outside of Gender Studies departments within the academy.

For example, Radical feminism argues that there exists an oppressive patriarchy that is the root cause of the most serious social problems. Violence and oppression of women, because they are women, is more fundamental than oppressions related to class, ethnicity, religion, etc. Radical feminists have been very vocal and active in influencing attitudes and state-wide school curriculum standards. Thus, it is not unusual for feminism to be equated with the ideas proposed by Radical feminism. Some find that the prioritization of oppression and the universalization of the idea of &quot;Woman,&quot; which was part of traditional Radical feminist thinking, too generic, and that women in other countries would never experience the same experience of being &quot;woman&quot; than women in Western countries did.

Some radical feminists advocate separatism—a complete separation of male and female in society and culture—while others question not only the relationship between men and women, but the very meaning of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; as well (see Queer theory). Some argue that gender roles, gender identity, and sexuality are themselves social constructs (see also heteronormativity). For these feminists, feminism is a primary means to human liberation (i.e., the liberation of men as well as women, and men and women from other social problems).

Other feminists believe that there may be social problems separate from or prior to patriarchy (e.g., racism or class divisions); they see feminism as one movement of liberation among many, each affecting the others. In this section, we will explore some of the main schools of feminist thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Germaine Greer has stirred up debate all her adult life, identifying herself since the late 50s as an anarchist. The Guardian reported that the writer Angela Carter described her as &quot;a clever fool&quot;, while former British MP Edwina Currie called her &quot;a great big hard-boiled prat&quot;. Christine Wallace used the terms &quot;grooviness personified&quot;, &quot;anachronistic passivity&quot;, and &quot;hegemonic heterosexuality&quot; to describe her subject, to which Greer replied that Wallace was a &quot;dung-beetle&quot; and &quot;a flesh-eating bacterium&quot;. Stephanie Merritt wrote in The Guardian:

&lt;blockquote&gt;She has been in the business of shaking up a complacent establishment for nearly 40 years now and was employing the most elemental shock tactic of getting naked in public both long before and long after it ever crossed Madonna's mind ... She has repeatedly written about her own experiences of lesbian sex, rape, abortion, infertility, failed marriage (she was married for three weeks to a construction worker in the 1960s) and menopause, thereby leaving herself open to claims that she shamelessly extrapolates from her own condition to the rest of womankind and calls it a theory ... In part, her ability to remain so prominently in the public consciousness comes from an astute understanding and well-established symbiotic relationship with a media as eager to be shocked as she is to shock. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1057077,00.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Greer was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1939, growing up in the bayside suburb of Mentone. After attending a convent, Star of the Sea College, in Gardenvale, Melbourne, she won a teaching scholarship in 1956 and enrolled at the University of Melbourne, where she acquired the nickname Germianic Queer, and graduated in 1959 with a B.A. (Hons.). She then moved to Sydney, where she became involved with the Sydney Push, a group of intellectual left-wing anarchists who practised non-monogamy. The writer Christine Wallace describes Greer at that time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Germaine, [the Push] provided a philosophy to underpin the attitude and lifestyle she had already acquired in Melbourne. She walked into the Royal George Hotel, into the throng talking themselves hoarse in a room stinking of stale beer and thick with cigarette smoke, and set out to follow the Push way of life — 'an intolerably difficult discipline which I forced myself to learn'. The Push struck her as completely different from the Melbourne intelligentsia she had engaged with in the Drift, 'who always talked about art and truth and beauty and argument ad hominem; instead, these people talked about truth and only truth, insisting that most of what we were exposed to during the day was ideology, which was a synonym for lies — or bullshit, as they called it.' Her Damascus turned out to be the Royal George, and the Hume Highway was the road to it. 'I was already an anarchist,' she says. 'I just didn't know why I was an anarchist. They put me in touch with the basic texts and I found out what the internal logic was about how I felt and thought' (Wallace 1997).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While in Sydney, Greer lectured at the University of Sydney, gaining an M.A. in 1963 for a thesis on Byron. A year later, the thesis won her a Commonwealth Scholarship, which she used to fund her doctorate at the University of Cambridge in England, where she became a member of the all-women's Newnham College.

Professor Lisa Jardine, who was at Newnham with Greer, recalled the first time she met Greer, at a college formal dinner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal called us to order for the speeches. As a hush descended, one person continued to speak, too engrossed in her conversation to notice, her strong Australian accent reverberating around the room. At the graduates' table, Germaine was explaining that there could be no liberation for women, no matter how highly educated, as long as we were required to cram our breasts into bras constructed like mini-Vesuviuses, two stitched white cantilevered cones which bore no resemblance to the female anatomy. The willingly suffered discomfort of the Sixties bra, she opined vigorously, was a hideous symbol of male oppression ... [W]e were ... astonished at the very idea that a woman could speak so loudly and out of turn and that words such as &quot;bra&quot; and &quot;breasts' — or maybe she said &quot;tits&quot; — could be uttered amid the psuedo-masculine solemnity of a college dinner. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1057077,00.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Greer joined the student amateur acting company, the Cambridge Footlights, which launched her into the London arts and media scene. Using the nom de plume Rose Blight, she wrote a gardening column for the satirical magazine Private Eye, and as Dr. G, became a regular contributor to the underground London OZ magazine, owned by Australian writer Richard Neville. [4] The July 29, 1970 edition was guest-edited by Greer, and featured an article of hers on the hand-knitted Cock Sock, &quot;a snug corner for a chilly prick.&quot;

She received her Ph.D. in 1968 for a thesis on Shakespeare's early comedies, and accepted a lectureship in English at the University of Warwick. The same year, in London, she married Australian journalist Paul du Feu, but the marriage lasted only three weeks, and ended in divorce in 1973.

Following her 1970 success with The Female Eunuch, Greer left Warwick in 1972 after flying around the world to promote her book. She co-presented a Granada Television comedy show called Nice Time with Kenny Everett and Jonathan Routh, bought a house in Italy, wrote a column for The Sunday Times, then spent the next few years traveling through Africa and Asia, which included a visit to Bangladesh to investigate the situation of women who had been raped during the conflict with Pakistan. On the New Zealand leg of her tour in 1972, Greer was arrested for using the word &quot;bullshit&quot; during her speech, which attracted major rallies in her support.

In 1989, Greer returned to Newnham College, Cambridge as a special lecturer and fellow, but left after attracting negative publicity in 1996 for allegedly &quot;outing&quot; Dr. Rachel Padman, a transsexual colleague. Greer unsuccessfully opposed Padman's election to a fellowship, on the grounds that Padman had been born a man, and Newnham was a women's college. A June 25, 1997 article by Clare Longrigg in The Guardian about the incident, entitled &quot;A Sister with No Fellow Feeling&quot;, disappeared from websites on the instruction of the newspaper's lawyers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women and states that capitalism, which gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.

Feminist theory (or radical feminism) emerged in the 1970s stating that modern society and its constructs (law, religion, politics, art, etc.) are predominantly the product of males and therefore have a patriarchal character. According to people who subscribed to this view, the best prescription for women's oppression would be to replace the patriarchy with a gender equal culture or to have a separation of the sexes. Some feminists at this time felt the emphasis on criticising a perceived patriarchy was too narrow and/or misguided and so there soon emerged feminists who began analysing women's situation from a class based Marxist/socialist perspective.

According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations; that is, people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit.

Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production and the major social divisions as class related. Women's subordination is seen as a form of oppression (rather than an illiberal discrimination) which is maintained (like racism) because it serves the interests of capital and the ruling class. Marxist feminists have also extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at domestic labour as well as waged work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos on August 22, 1963 in Newton, North Carolina, USA) is an American singer-songwriter. She is married to her English sound engineer Mark Hawley, and they have one daughter together, Natashya &quot;Tash&quot; Lorien Hawley, born on September 5, 2000.

Amos was one of a number of confessional female singer-songwriters in the early 1990s and is noteworthy as one of the few modern popular music stars to utilize a piano as her primary instrument. She is known for lyrically opaque but emotionally intense songs that tackle a wide range of subjects, including sexuality, religion, patriarchy and personal tragedy. Some of her charting singles include &quot;Crucify&quot;, &quot;Silent All These Years&quot;, &quot;Me and a Gun&quot;, &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;, &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;, &quot;Professional Widow&quot; and &quot;Spark&quot;.

Amos has experienced limited chart success in the United States and the United Kingdom but has also enjoyed a large cult following. She is also known for making eccentric comments during interviews and in concerts.

At age 21, Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. While there she managed to get several acting jobs, including a Kellogg's Just Right cereal commercial (for which role she beat out a then-unknown Sarah Jessica Parker). (Amos says that she got the job because she could actually play the piano, whereas Parker could not.) After playing a bar one night, she gave a ride home to a patron, who sexually assaulted her—an experience that would feed into her emotionally-charged song &quot;Me and a Gun.&quot; She also met Steve Caton, who played guitars on her albums through To Venus and Back (1999).

=== Starting RAINN ===
After touring throughout 1992 in support of Little Earthquakes, Amos went to New Mexico to write her second solo record, Under the Pink. It debuted at #1 in the UK and #12 in the US charts on its release in January 1994. It disappointed some critics, however, who considered it a step sideways rather than forwards from Little Earthquakes (but was voted among the greatest albums of the 1990s by Rolling Stone magazine some years later). In February, she began the &quot;Under the Pink&quot; tour. Four tracks were released as singles: &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot; (a #4 single in the UK), &quot;Pretty Good Year&quot; and &quot;Past the Mission&quot;, which featured the vocal contribution of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. A limited edition release of the album commemorating the Australian tour included a second disc entitled &quot;More Pink&quot;, a collection of B-Sides.

Around this time an Australian tabloid managed to take &quot;up-skirt&quot; photographs of Amos during a live performance at which she was not wearing panties. Amos did not comment on this until eleven years later, citing it as her impetus to not return to Australia during a tour between 1995 and 2005.

Amos also contributed the song &quot;Butterfly&quot; to the soundtrack for the 1994 movie Higher Learning as well as a cover of the R.E.M song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;.

In June, 1994, Amos co-founded RAINN, The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network. RAINN is a toll-free help line in the US which connects callers with their local rape crisis center. In 1995, Amos, duetting with Robert Plant, contributed the song &quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; to the Led Zeppelin tribute album Encomium.

Amos performed a highly publicized television concert called &quot;The Concert for RAINN&quot; in late 1996. This coincided with &quot;National RAINN Day&quot;, and during the concert all cable and network television stations aired Amos' public service announcement about the organization. During this concert Amos performed a song with her friend Maynard James Keenan of the band Tool. During this year she also co-wrote/performed a song called &quot;It Might Hurt a Little Bit&quot; with singer Michael Stipe of the band R.E.M.. It was intended for the soundtrack to the film Don Juan DeMarco but was not used and has never been released.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) in the United States is a toll-free, confidential and anonymous provider of counseling to victims of rape and sexual assault.

RAINN was founded in 1994 by Scott Berkowitz, the organization's president. RAINN has attracted the attention of many celebrities, notably singer Tori Amos, who contributed a portion of the initial funding. She has remained their most avid spokesperson and a great deal of the attention brought to the organization comes from her fanbase. Some of the funding to RAINN comes from the &quot;Happy Birthday, Tori&quot; parties; a series of fundraising events held throughout the world on (or around) the date of Amos' birthday.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conflict Defined ==
Conflict can exist between factions or groups within a team, with a leader or manager, and with other teams or departments within the company. It has been defined in numerously different ways and has come to hold several connotations. The following is an example of a relatively broad dictionary entry, where '''''conflict''''' is defined in the following way(s):
 
'''Conflict'''      

'''1'''. To come into collision or disagreement; be contradictory, at variance, or in opposition; clash: The account of one eyewitness conflicted with that of the other. My class conflicts with my going to the concert.  

'''2'''. To fight or contend; do battle.  

'''3'''. A fight, battle, or struggle, esp. a prolonged struggle; strife.  

'''4'''. Controversy; quarrel: conflicts between parties.  

'''5'''. Discord of action, feeling, or effect; antagonism or opposition, as of interests or principles: a conflict of ideas.  

'''6'''. A striking together; collision.  

'''7'''. Incompatibility or interference, as of one idea, desire, event, or activity with another: a conflict in the schedule.  

'''8'''. Psychiatry. a mental struggle arising from opposing demands or impulses.




===&lt;u&gt;'''Conflict in Groups and Teams'''&lt;/u&gt;===

Conflict inevitably arises in one form or another in varying degrees due to the mere group and/or team dynamics of having people with differing backgrounds, ideas, and potential agendas coming together in an effort to accomplish a common goal. Conflict is generally considered to be negative and something to be avoided. Numerous frameworks such as LaFasto and Larson's CONNECT model have been developed to help rid groups of negative conflict. However, conflict isn’t always negative and there are circumstances in which positive conflict is necessary in order to prevent compliance tendencies and the potentially disastrous effects of [[w:Groupthink|''groupthink'']]. 

In the following sections, the positive and negative realms of conflict will be outlined and further detailed in an effort to narrow the scope of conflict while helping to navigate some of the more negative connotations that easily come to mind when thinking about conflict. Use all positive words and actions and you will get the same back, respect others and they will respect you.

== Types of Conflict that a Team Can Face ==

'''''Positive conflict''' vs '''Negative conflict'''''

==='''Positive conflict'''===
[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]
Positive conflict is the notion that a healthy discourse may  exist in the disagreement among group members regarding personality traits, styles, or characteristics or the content of their ideas, decisions or task processes which involves a  pathway towards resolution. Any tolerable amount of conflict is vital to group success in order to avoid groupthink and to generate more innovative ideas among potentially and vastly differing members of the group. In addition, positive conflict generates buy-in and offers elements of ownership and a sense of cooperation and enhanced membership to all of the group members. Positive conflict reduces the effects of conformity pressures and groupthink. Groupthink occurs when conformity and compliance pressures are exaggerated, and it generally occurs in the absence of task conflict. One of the most devastating examples of groupthink occurred on the morning of January 28th, 1986 in which the [[w:Challenger_space_shuttle|Challenger space shuttle]] exploded  over the Atlantic Ocean after the failure of an O-ring. This failure resulted from the O-ring being unable to withstand extreme temperatures in which the O-ring had never been truly tested.  Numerous NASA staff members were aware of the possible failure of the O-ring in extreme temperatures, and they were also aware of the ramifications should the O-ring break. However, the decision making process regarding whether or not the shuttle was safe to launch was riddled with flaws that ultimately created a breeding ground for groupthink. To illustrate, the Challenger launch had been postponed several times before this scheduled date, and there was direct pressure from NASA to approve the launch. There was also media pressure as they were scheduled to film the launch, since it would be the first time a teacher was sent into space. NASA officials feared public ridicule if the launch was delayed again, and as early as six days prior to the launch, NASA put the pressure on. They told the inspectors to stop thinking like inspectors and start thinking like managers, and they rationalized that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest that the O-ring would not work. As a result, the inspectors bowed to conformity pressures and gave the approval to launch. The resulting launch and subsequent death of all 7 crew members aboard the Challenger shook the nation and was not the front page news that NASA had hoped for.

Other disasters that occurred due to conformity pressures include the Bay of Pigs, the Tenerife plane crash disaster, the holocaust, and many others. To test how strong the effects of conformity pressures are on less cohesive groups and among individuals that were only recently introduced, [[w:Asch_conformity_experiments|Solomon Asch]] conducted his famous conformity experiment in which  a group of random participants were shown a picture of the following lines, and they were asked which line in the second group of lines is approximately the same height as the first line shown.

[[File:Asch experiment.svg|thumb|300px|Example of the cards shown to the participants of the study]]

Individuals that were a part of the experiment (confederates to the experiment) selected an obviously inappropriate line such as line “B” as their answer. The results were astounding in which the remaining individual in the group (not a confederate to the experiment) also selected line “B” as their answer due to perceived pressures to conform.  Conformity occurs as a result of individuals’ desire to be liked and their need to be right. Therefore, they tend to fall victim to [[w:false_consensus_effect|false consensus bias]]es and generally bring their behavior in line with the group’s expectations and beliefs. So how are you to know if your group is falling prey to conformity pressures and groupthink? Here are some common symptoms: 

:*Illusions of invulnerability
:*Rationalization &amp; justification
:*Illusion of group morality
:*Stereotyping the out-group as weaker, evil, or stupid
:*Direct or indirect peer or supervisory pressures
:*Self-censorship by team members
:*Illusions of unanimity

First, realizing that you and your group are affected by or susceptible to conformity pressures and groupthink is very important. Next, in order to create a norm of conflict, it is essential that a feeling of psychology safety is present. This can be instated by encouraging objections, criticisms, and altering perspectives. Also, as a leader, one should avoid making clear statements about your preferences, create subgroups, have outside experts come in to observe the decision making process, and re-examine the next best alternatives once a decision has been reached. Finally, limiting the size of the group and assigning roles that make conflict commonplace (such as a “[[w:Devil%27s_advocate|Devil’s Advocate]]”) will help to discourage and minimize compliance pressures.  After the Challenger explosion, NASA took similar steps to avoid future disasters in which they instituted a verbal and video recorded affirmation from several NASA officials that certify flight readiness. Furthermore, NASA's managers instituted a veto policy in which anyone at any level is given the authority to stop the flight process. 

In addition to avoiding groupthink and conformity pressures, positive conflict is more likely to generate a sense of membership, involvement, and enthusiasm from all group members and is also more likely to lead to the infusion of more creative and innovative ideas. This results from each team member having the opportunity to voice his or her own perspective on the issues being decided by the group. When individuals feel more involved in the decision making process, they are more likely to state a high satisfaction level with their team and are additionally more likely to want to continue working as a member of that team. 

Creating a [[w:Heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] team is another way to encourage diverse perspectives, opinions, and ideas. Heterogeneous groups also have a broader knowledge base resulting from a variety of experiences, backgrounds, skills, and achievements. Comparable to other investment strategies that are somewhat more risky (in terms of the increased likelihood for ensuing conflict levels), diverse teams stand a greater chance for potential return and favorable results as well.

==='''Negative conflict'''===

[[File:Soc-psy intergroup.svg|thumb|250px|right|Interactions]]
In diverse and heterogeneous teams, negative conflict has a tendency to emerge in varying degrees due to the mere dynamics of having diverse individuals with differing backgrounds, ideas, and potential agendas coming together. Negative conflict can arise in several different arenas including the following: 
:*Conflict can arise between factions or groups within a team.
::*Subgroups, or factions, can develop within a team. Each group has their own opinions and will stick together and oppose other factions within the team. Organizations can be greatly divided by such factions
:*Conflict can develop between team members and the leader of the team. 
::*Team members can disagree with the team leader. This can lead to refusal to follow the direction of the team leader. There may be conflict with management because management has not given clear goals to the team or may not be supporting the team. The organization could have a culture that does not allow teams to work effectively. 

:*Conflict can form between the different teams or departments in the organization. 

Unlike positive conflict, negative conflict is better if  avoided and must be swiftly addressed and resolved when it does present itself. Due to the dangerous nature and destructive effects negative conflict has on productivity and moral, it may potentially lead to Human Resource Management issues or even a lawsuit. In order to set the stage so that interpersonal conflict is avoided or at least minimized, firms can prevent the establishment of in-groups and out-groups, foster open communication and trust, understand the various personality styles that comprise a group, and coach effective communication skills and perspective taking skills to team members. 

An example of a firm, where the formation of in-groups and out-groups fostered so much negative conflict, was the Lehman Brothers firm, this in-group and out-group culture lead to the selling of the firm. Within this firm, a strong separation between Traders and Bankers literally divided the corporation and led to its ultimate demise. Differences between the functions were exaggerated and there was a perception that each of the divisions was pursuing its own unique and more valuable objectives. There was not a unified vision within the company and personality conflict was commonplace. The Traders believed that the Bankers were lazy &quot;Ivy League&quot; graduates who were awarded greater benefits simply to uphold the status-quo. The Bankers perceived the Brokers as less intelligent, blue collar workers who deserved less compensation and rewards.  Creating in-groups and out-groups in a company leads to an unhealthy competition between the groups. Each faction ends up battling for a greater share of the company’s limited resources and an “us” vs. “them” rational emerges, while energy is wasted on trying to prove which group is better rather than to maintain common goals. As demonstrated by the infamous Robbers Cave Experiment conducted by Muzafer Sherif, working toward a common goal and maintaining common purpose is essential for group unity and contributes to the reduction of personal conflict. In this experiment, 22 boy scouts were assigned to two separate camps and neither group was aware of the other's existence. Each boy formed a strong identification with his own group, and the scouts were even allowed to select a group name. The first contact between the two groups was to play a competitive sport and friction emerged between the groups almost immediately. During the resolution phase of the experiment, a task was developed in which the two groups were forced to cooperate and work together toward achieving a common purpose that neither group could achieve alone. A broken-down truck that needed to be towed back to the camp was staged, and the two groups had to combine their man-power to tow the truck. By the end of the experiment, the in-groups and out-groups had merged, and the entire group even insisted upon riding back home on the same bus together. In addition to forming a super-ornate goal for group members to achieve, pointing out what group members have in common and defusing stereotypes is a way to prevent the formation of an out-group. 

Fostering support, trust, and open communication is also essential if relationship conflicts are to be reduced and quickly resolved. Open communication can be established by the following: 

:*'''Establish ground rules.'''
::*Take turns when talking and do not interrupt. Ensure that each team member has equal time when stating their perspective. Listen for something new and say bring something new to the discussion. Avoid restating the facts and “talking in circles.” Avoid power plays and eliminate status or titles from the discussion
:*'''Listen compassionately'''  
::*Avoid thinking of a counterargument while the other person is speaking. Listen to the other person’s perspective rather than listening to your own thoughts. Don’t make an effort to remember points.
:*'''Point out the advantages of resolving the conflict.'''
:*'''Maintain a neutral vantage point and be willing to be persuaded.'''
:*'''Avoid all-or-none statements such as “always” and “never” and point out exceptions when these statements are used.'''
::*(IE: What does it look like when Marketing does consult sales before acting?)
:*'''Create a goal of discovery rather than of winning or persuading.'''
:*'''Be alert to common goals and where goals overlap as each party is communicating their perspective.'''
:*'''Use clarifying statements to ensure the other party feels understood and listened to such as, “What I heard you say is that you feel unappreciated and that you lack vital feedback to help you perform, is this correct?”'''
:*'''Help team members to separate the problem from the person.''' 
:*'''Use techniques such as role-playing, putting oneself in the competitor’s shoes, or conducting war games. Such techniques create fresh perspectives and engage team members.'''
:*'''Team members should recognize each other for having expressed his view and feelings.'''
::*Thanking one another recognizes the personal risk the individual took in breaking from group think and should be viewed as an expression of trust and commitment toward the team.
:*'''Help each team member to understand one anothers' perspective, and help them to re-frame the situation.
::*The exact same situation can often be viewed differently by several individuals. To illustrate, what did you see first in the picture below, the young woman or the old woman?

[[Image:Youngoldwoman.jpg|thumb|200px|Which do you see?]]

Once a team has received coaching on how to communicate effectively, address conflict situations immediately as they arise. Letting tense situations fester will only allow time for animosity to polarize and grow.  Helping team members to reframe the problem and see it from the other individual’s perspective can also be accomplished directly, via cross-training and job shadowing which allows each team member to draw from a frame of reference by walking in the other team member's shoes.  Utilizing the [http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/ Big 5 personality test] descriptions will also add an element of understanding to the group dynamic. To illustrate, if Jimmy is highly extroverted, neurotic, and conscientious, it may help Tim, who is not quite as extroverted as than Jim and who is more agreeable, to understand where Jimmy’s seemingly endless ability to voice his irritation with others is stemming from, and he may not take it as personally. In addition, Jimmy may better understand and get less irritated with Tim’s perceived inability to take initiative and make decisions efficiently. 

Finally, understanding common stereotypes and mental shortcuts that are used when passing judgment on others will make team members more aware of how these shortcuts are leading to bias conclusions. The common cognitive biases and a brief description are as follows: 

:*[[w:Self_fulfilling_prophecy|Self Fulfilling Prophecy]]: the tendency to engage in behaviors that elicit results which will (consciously or subconsciously) confirm our beliefs.

:*[[w:Halo_effect|Halo Effect]]: the tendency for a person's positive or negative traits to &quot;spill over&quot; from one area of their personality to another in others' perceptions of them

:*[[w:Primacy_effect|Primacy Effect]]: the tendency to weigh initial events more than subsequent events.

:*[[w:Primacy_effect|Recency Effect]]: the tendency to weigh recent events more than earlier events

:*[[w:Availability_heuristic|Availability Heuristic]]: a biased prediction, due to the tendency to focus on the most salient and emotionally-charged outcome.

:*[[w:Selective_perception|Selective Perception]]: selectively attend to data that supports your conclusion while omitting valid evidence that does not. 

:*[[w:Actor-observer_bias|Actor-Observer Bias]]: the tendency for explanations for other individual's behaviors to overemphasize the influence of their personality and underemphasize the influence of their situation. This is coupled with the opposite tendency for the self in that one's explanations for their own behaviors overemphasize their situation and underemphasize the influence of their personality.

:*[[w:Hindsight_Bias|Hindsight Bias]]: sometimes called the &quot;I-knew-it-all-along&quot; effect, the inclination to see past events as being predictable.

:*[[w:Illusory_correlation|Illusory Correlation]]: beliefs that inaccurately suppose a relationship between a certain type of action and an effect

:*[[w:Egocentric_bias|Egocentric Bias]]: occurs when people claim more responsibility for themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would.

:*[[w:False_consensus_effect|False Consensus Bias]]: the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them.

:*[[w:Fundamental_attribution_bias|Fundamental Attribution Bias]]: the tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior

:*[[w:Just-world_phenomenon|Just World Phenomenon]]: the tendency for people to believe that the world is &quot;just&quot; and therefore people &quot;get what they deserve.&quot;
   
:*[[w:Self_serving_bias|Self Serving Bias]]: the tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests

:*[[w:Illusion_of_transparency|Illusion of Transparency]]: people overestimate others' ability to know them, and they also overestimate their ability to know others.

:*[[w:Ingroup_bias|Ingroup Bias]]: the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups.

== Why is Conflict Resolution Important in a Team Setting? ==

Whether we embrace it or avoid it, conflict is an inherent part of the human condition.  Unlike certain tasks or responsibilities, conflict is not isolated to one or another aspect of life.  With conflict looming all about us, why should we even bother trying to resolve it?  Or, if conflict is inherent to being human, is it then presumptuous to even attempt its resolution?  We propose that, in the vast majority of instances of team conflict, avoidance is a worse solution than engagement with the conflicting situation.  Moreover, avoided conflict will lead to less optimal solutions and may even prevent the team from finishing a project.  Thus, from a manager’s perspective, it is a simple equation of a cost/benefits analysis in that the cost to the organization is greater when teams avoid conflict than when they engage it.  In this chapter we will discuss the symptoms of conflict and recommend solutions for their resolution.

Conflict absorbs team resources that could be better utilized working towards the team’s goals.  As discussed, managers should manage conflict in a way that leads the team towards completion of team goals.  

== What are the Symptoms of Team Conflict? ==

Almost everyone has endured the experience of being part of a team that was plagued with conflict.  Whether in a large group that erupts in anger and can’t finish a meeting, or a small group of two or three individuals that resort to backbiting and gossiping to vent frustration over a conflict, everyone has been a part of a team where conflict has gotten out of control.  With this in mind, there are several symptoms of conflict that can be identified in groups which can help groups to recognize and manage conflict before it tears them apart.  By identifying the following symptoms related to communication, trust, and opposing agendas, the team leader can identify conflict before it erupts.  As you read through these symptoms, think of the teams that you are a part of and look for symptoms that exist in your team. 

One common symptom of conflict is a lack of [[communication]] or a lack of respectful communication.  This is most often seen when teams fail to have meaningful meetings.  Most often, non-communicating meetings are characterized by team members sitting and listening to what the boss has to say.  Often chatter or silence prevails in teams.  A lack of communication can also be noted when team members don’t get along, and so refuse to talk to each other.  These feuds create barriers within teams and prevent communication in the team.  
A lack of communication or disrespectful communication leads to a lack of trust, which is another symptom of team conflict.  Teams that fail to produce desired results often lack the trust in one another as team members necessary to succeed.  Without trust in a team, verbal or non-verbal conflict becomes the norm of the team. Team members spend more energy protecting their own positions and jobs then they do producing what is required for the team’s success. When trust erodes in a team, the habit of blaming others becomes the norm as individuals try to protect themselves.  Team members become enemies that compete against each other rather than allies that build and help one another to achieve a common goal.  Teams that lack trust often gossip about other members or have frequent side conversations after meetings to discuss opposing opinions.  Such activity sucks strength out of the team and its purpose. 

Another symptom of team conflict can be seen when team members have opposing agendas.  This is not to be confused with members who have different opinions.  Having different opinions in a group can be very healthy if managed correctly because it can create better ideas and ways of getting the job done.  However, when team members have opposing agendas, more is at stake than differing opinions; it is two individuals fiercely committed to the exact opposite approach.  Opposing agendas can create confusion in team members and can cause them to lose sight of their role in the team and the team’s final goal.  Teams must work toward a common goal in order to be successful.  Extreme effort must be made to reconcile differences, or such a team can look forward to failure.

== What are Appropriate Solutions to Conflict? ==

As mentioned above, conflict is a natural and necessary element of a healthy team experience.  If a team never experiences conflict, it is less likely to be as productive as a team that does experience conflict.  This is especially true if the task that a team is attempting to complete is complex in nature or highly detailed.  Without having members question specific actions, decisions, or the specifics of the proposed solution, it may appear to the team that there is only one way in which to solve the problem or complete the task.   

One way in which a team can avoid being unproductive is by selecting members with different backgrounds.  This can be difficult because people often assume that individuals who think similarly and get along with one another will be more productive when working together.  But this is not necessarily true.  In many cases having groups of people who think alike and are not willing to voice their disagreement can be detrimental, or even dangerous.  Popular examples of this group think phenomenon are noted in the Kennedy Administration’s disaster with regards to the Bay of Pigs, or those involved with the Challenger shuttle launch. Differences among team members should however, be task orientated and not personal or relationship oriented.  Relationship conflicts are rarely productive.  If potential members of a team have a history of conflict due to relationships and not in relation to tasks, one or both should probably not be chosen as a team member.  Additionally, peacekeepers should also be avoided, unless the team environment fosters a very safe atmosphere where the peacekeeper will feel comfortable enough to speak out in the team setting.  In this case, a difference in opinion could be beneficial, but it might not be presented due to the member’s disproportionate desire to avoid conflict.  

Avoiding the potential for group think, relationship conflicts, and peacekeepers in choosing team members will help to promote healthy conflict.  But commitment is equally important.  If team members are individually or collectively indifferent toward the overall goal, they probably will not perform well.  A lack of commitment can also lead to a lack of conflict.  If the team is committed to the overall goal and members are well chosen, there can be a healthy dose of conflict in the process to complete the task.

When conflict does occur, it is important to address it immediately.  Although developing a solution to the conflict may take time, acknowledging it will help to ensure that it can become productive to the team. “Whatever the problem, effective teams identify, raise, and resolve it. If it’s keeping them from reaching their goal, effective teams try to do something about it. They don’t ignore it and hope it goes away.”  By not addressing conflict, the leader risks sending the message that conflict is unmanageable and cause vested members to become complacent or feel their input is not valued.  In the worst scenario, a conflict that is not resolved could go from being task orientated to personal.

== How Can a Team Prevent Negative Conflict? ==

Conflict may be inevitable on a team and may even have a positive effect, “the absence of conflict is not harmony, it’s apathy.”  However, most of us have had experience with the crippling side of conflict. In this section we offer insight into how other teams have successfully managed conflict and make recommendations for mechanisms to put into place in order to prevent harmful conflict. 
How do successful teams manage conflict?

Three business professors, who studied teams which had learned how to successfully “fight” in a team without allowing the conflict to become destructive, found some common themes as to how such teams function.  First, successful teams worked with more, rather than less information and debated on the basis of facts.  Second, teams developed multiple alternatives to enrich the level of debate.  Third, productive teams shared commonly agreed upon goals and objectives.  Fourth, teams injected humor into the decision-making process.  Fifth, teams maintained a balanced power structure.  And sixth, teams resolved issues without forcing consensus.

In another study, which surveyed 15,000 team members and their assessments of their team mates, two professors found that the most important behaviors in team relationships are openness and supportiveness, “Regardless of whether it was a working relationship with a peer, a superior, or a direct report, the result was the same. The two factors identified as most important were openness and supportiveness.”  Moreover, the authors identify specifically what is meant by these two adjectives within a team context: openness “refers to the ability to surface and deal with issues objectively,”  while supportiveness “refers to bringing out the best thinking and attitude in the other person.”

From the above insights into successful teams, we start to see that such teams put a high value on fact-based decisions and are able to set up mechanisms that bring out the best in each team member and facilitate information sharing.  Drawing from these insights, then, what specific measures, should a new leader or newly formed team put into place to ensure the team can withstand conflict and even gain the benefits of creativity that comes out of conflict?

== How Do Teams Prevent Damaging Conflict? ==

In order to prevent damaging conflict, the team leader must lay a conflict-friendly foundation for the team. The following approach will help the team leader to set the stage for conflict that is creative and productive:

# Set a clear goal for the team.
# Make expectations for team members explicit.
# Assemble a heterogeneous team, including diverse ages, genders, functional backgrounds, and industry experience. 
# Meet together as a team regularly and often. Team members that don’t know one another well doesn’t know positions on the issues, impairing their ability to argue effectively. Frequent interaction builds the mutual confidence and familiarity team members require expressing dissent. 
# Assign roles such as devil’s advocate and sky-gazing visionary and change these roles up from meeting to meeting. This is important to ensure all sides of an issue have been considered. 
# Use techniques such as role-playing, putting oneself in the competitor’s shoes, or conducting war games. Such techniques create fresh perspectives and engage team members. 
# Actively manage conflict. Don’t let the team acquiesce too soon or too easily. Identify and treat apathy early, and don’t confuse a lack of conflict with agreement. 

== Resolving Conflict ==

Interpersonal conflict should be managed and resolved before it degenerates into verbal assault and irreparable damage to a team. Dealing with interpersonal conflict can be a difficult and uncomfortable process.  Usually, as team members, we use carefully worded statements to avoid frictions when confronting conflict. 
 
The first step to resolving interpersonal conflict is in acknowledging the existence of the interpersonal conflict. Recognizing the conflict allows team members to build common ground by putting the conflict within the context of the larger goal of the team and the organization. Moreover, the larger goal can help by giving team members a motive for resolving the conflict. 

The Rosetta Stone for dealing with conflict is communication.  As team members we all understand the inevitability of interpersonal conflicts. Moreover, as we have established above, open and supportive communication is vital to a high performing team.  One way to achieve this is by separating the problem from the person. Problems can be debated without damaging working relationships. When interpersonal conflict occurs, all sides of the issue should be recognized without finger-pointing or blaming. Above all, when team member gets yelled at or blamed for something, it has the effect of silencing the whole team. It gives the signal to everyone that dissent is not allowed, and, as we know, dissent is one of the most fertile resources for new ideas. 

When faced with conflict, it is natural for team members to become defensive.  However defensiveness usually makes it more difficult to resolve a conflict.  A conflict-friendly team environment must encourage effective listening. Effective listening includes listening to one another attentively, without interruption (this includes not having side conversations, doodling, or vacant stares).
The fundamentals to resolving team conflict include the following elements: 

# Prior to stating one’s view, a speaker should seek to understand what others have said. This can be done in a few clarifying sentences, 
# Seek to make explicit what the opposing sides have in common. This helps to reinforce what is shared between the disputants, 
# Whether or not an agreement is reached, team members should thank the other for having expressed his view and feelings. Thanking the other recognizes the personal risk the individual took in breaking from group think and should be viewed as an expression of trust and commitment toward the team. 

=== How Can Teams Resolve Conflict Between Factions? ===

In resolving conflict between factions, the team leader should start by bringing the groups together and acknowledging there is a conflict. The team leader should make sure all group members are clear about the group goal.  Not only should each group member understand what the goal is, they each need to be willing to work toward achieving it. 
 
Set ground rules for the group if this has not been done.  An important rule to include is to eliminate outside politicking.  When disagreements or issues arise, they should be discussed within the group.  Factions should not have separate discussions about the problem.  If ground rules have already been established, discuss whether all agree with them and are willing to follow them.  Discuss the methods and processes that will be used to reach the team goal.  Again, it is important to get all team members working together towards the common goal.

The team leader should stay alert to one faction forcing a particular solution.  If such an instance arises, those forcing a solution should be asked to articulate the reason behind their thinking.  Once the thinking has been articulated, there can be open discussion as to the merits and drawbacks to the proposed solution. 

=== What Should a Team Leader Do To Resolve Conflict and Promote Team Performance? ===
Team leaders have the responsibility of resolving conflict within their teams.  There are things that team leaders can do to make a team where conflict resolution occurs naturally.  One thing that team leaders can do in their groups to resolve conflict is to set up team rules from the outset.  As discussed earlier, such team rules can guide team members to resolve conflict between themselves, rather than going to the leader to resolve all conflict.  Team leaders should foster an environment in their teams that is safe and positive.  Such an environment will help foster communication and will help team members to resolve conflicts.  Team leaders can also provide retreats and other activities away from the office that will help to build team unity and trust.  These factors will also strengthen a team and help to avoid negative conflict before it begins. 

Team leaders can also strictly monitor performance issues in their group.  Performance issues that go unresolved create relationship conflict and a lack of motivation and morale.  Performance issues in individual team members must be addressed immediately in order to avoid issues in the group.  This doesn’t mean that team leaders always need to eliminate poor performing team members immediately.  Sometimes it is the responsibility of the team leader to provide extra training to team members when they’re struggling, to help them meet expectations.  When attitudes need to be changed, awareness can be brought to how a team member’s attitude negatively affects the team and invitations can be given for attitudes to improve.  

In this process it is vital for the team leader to remember that accountability must be held with team members.  Without accountability in a team, focus on the goal will not occur and teams won’t produce desired outcomes.  Accountability promotes achievement and helps team members to reach their potential.  A lack of accountability can produce great task conflict and relationship conflict.  Full accountability can help produce a feeling of fulfillment and achievement and teams will achieve their optimal performance.

=== How Can a Team Member Resolve a Conflict with the Team Leader? ===

If a team member has a conflict with the team leader, the first step is to identify the type of conflict.  If the conflict relates to the goal of the team, then it would appear that the goal is not clear.  The conflict can also relate to the processes being used by the team.  In either situation, the team member can bring up the issue in a group meeting.  Ask that the goal be clarified so that all team members understand what it is.  If processes were never discussed and decided on by the team, now would be an appropriate time to do so.  If the team leader does not want to discuss these issues in a team meeting, the team member should approach the leader separately to discuss.  The team member should explain the issue and why the current situation is not working.  Again, ask that the team be allowed to discuss these issues.

If the conflict is interpersonal between the team leader and a team member, the issue should be discussed privately between the two.  The team member should go to the leader and explain that there appears to be conflict and that he or she would like to resolve it.  LaFasto and Larson outline an approach that can be used to resolve conflict called the Connect Model.  The steps involved in the model are as follows: 

# Commit to the relationship. 
# Optimize safety. 
# Narrow to one issue. 
# Neutralize defensiveness.
# Explain and echo.
# Change one behavior each.
# Track it!

These steps provide a great review of what has been discussed throughout this chapter and will help to resolve the issue between a team leader and team member.    

In summary, team conflict is an important and integral part of any team that exists. As we have outlined it in this chapter, conflict, if approached effectively and managed appropriately, can exponentially work in the favor of any team. Appropriate management of the relative type of team conflict at hand is critical for teams to be successful.  This chapter has discussed several of the aspects of team conflict and how they can be best managed and potentially resolved. These concepts will help teams improve their functionality and dynamic effectiveness in an effort to reach their ultimate goals in reaching to be a high performing team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rape is an an act in which a victim is forced into sexual activity, in particular sexual penetration, against his or her will. The word originates from the Latin ''rapere'': to seize or take by force. The Latin term for the act of rape itself is ''raptus''.

Originally, the word rape was akin to rapine, rapture, raptor, and rapacious, and referred to the more general violations, such as looting, destruction, and capture of citizens that are inflicted upon a town or country during war, e.g. the Rape of Nanking. Today, some dictionaries still define rape to include any serious and destructive assault against a person or community. This article, however, focuses primarily on sexual assault. Rape is an issue of central concern to many feminists.

==Violent rape==
&quot;Violent rape&quot; is when violence beyond the rape itself is a part of the assault. This may include physical force or threat of harm, including death threat or threat against a family member. People who commit violent rapes include both strangers and people whom the victim already knows. Proportionally more violent rapes are likely to be reported. &lt;ref&gt; Bachman, R., &amp; Saltzman, L. (1995). Violence against women: Estimates from the redesigned survey (No.
NCJ-154348). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Statutory rape==
National and/or regional governments, citing an interest in protecting minors, consider people under a certain age to be unable to give informed consent, and accordingly treat any sexual contact with minors as &quot;rape&quot;, even if he or she agrees to the sexual activity. The age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent is called the age of consent. The age set by each state vary in accordance with local standards, and range from 12 to 21. Sex which violates age-of-consent law, but is neither violent nor physically coerced, is sometimes described as &quot;statutory rape&quot;, the name of a legally-recognized category in the United States.

== Acquaintance (&quot;date&quot;) rape ==
The term, &quot;acquaintance rape&quot; (or &quot;date rape&quot;) refers to rape or non-consensual sexual activity between people who are already acquainted, or who know each other socially — friends, acquaintances, people on a date, or even people in an existing romantic relationship — where it is alleged that consent for sexual activity was not given, or was given under duress. In most jurisdictions, there is no legal distinction between rape committed by a stranger, or by an acquaintance, friend or lover.

There is often more difficulty in securing conviction against an assailant who is known by the victim at the time. This is due to the &quot;grey&quot; nature of the situation. In what is colloquially described as a &quot;grey rape&quot; case, the victim is unable to demonstrate non-consent although he or she expresses displeasure at the encounter. The expression, &quot;grey rape&quot;, refers to the absence of information — there is nothing &quot;grey&quot; in the act itself: if the act was non-consensual at the time it occurred, then it is considered rape, even if not actionably so. Contributing factors to &quot;grey&quot; rape include poor communication by either party, misleading or (deliberately) misreading body language, or the feeling by one party of being unsure or unable to express what one wishes (which may be due to many reasons). The standard of proof required for non-consensual sexual activity is often harder to meet (or easier to deny) than when two strangers meet, or where there has been violence.

In general, some evidence suggests that rapists are far more likely to know their victims than not. Other reports suggest that it can work both ways. Not only is acquaintance rape more common than previously thought, but situations of this kind can more often give rise to false allegations than had been expected (see False reporting).

== Male rape == 
Men can also be raped. According to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics, for 2003 [2], 9.9% of rape and sexual assault victims in the United States, age 12 and older, are male; therefore, nearly 17 out of every 100,000 males are victims. According to the data for 2004, this number has fallen to 2.95%; therefore, slightly more than 5 out of every 100,000 males are victims. Many of these male victims are likely children and there may be many more male victims under age 12 (not included in BJS figures).

==Gang rape==
Gang-rape (also known as &quot;pack rape&quot;) occurs when a group of people participates in the rape of a single victim. It is far more damaging for the victim, and in some jurisdictions, is punished more severely than a rape by one person. &quot;Gang bang&quot; is also a slang term for consensual group sex. (It is not to be confused with the slang word &quot;gangbanger&quot; referring to a member of a criminal gang; the &quot;bang&quot; in that word refers to the sound of gunfire.)

According to Roy Hazelwood, a profiler of sexual crimes, gang rape &quot;involves three or more offenders and you always have a leader and a reluctant participant. Those are extremely violent, and what you find is that they're playing for each other's approval. It gets into a pack mentality and can be horrendous.&quot;

      <comment>/* Sentence Structure */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several different types of sentences.  Each are classified based on their structure and their purpose.

==Sentence Structure==
Using a variety of sentences helps the reader follow the flow of a writer’s thoughts. Choosing between simple, compound, and complex sentences and mixing them up throughout the material will keep the reader interested. Varying the length of the sentences also keeps the reader involved.

Reading material that marches along becomes tedious. For example:

''The band marched along the street, and the director signaled for the drums to play. A red car stopped at the intersection, and the parents walked beside the band. The parents squirted water into the musicians’ mouths, and the trumpet players started to play. The band marched past the intersection, and the red car proceeded down the street''.  

Reading this group of compound sentences becomes boring. If the writer mixes up the types of sentences like the example below, the sentences will flow more easily for the reader. 

''As the band marched along the street, the director signaled for the drums to play. A red car stopped at the intersection. While the parents walked beside the band, they squirted water into the trumpet players’ mouths. The trumpet players started to play. The band marched past the intersection, and the red car proceeded down the street.''  

The first sentence is complex, and the second one is simple. The third is again complex while the fourth is simple. The fifth sentence is compound. The choppiness is gone, and a flow is created.

Sentence structure is determined based on the number of clauses in the sentence.  A clause can be independent or subordinate.

===Independent clause===

* Full sentence pattern that can operate on its own and does not function within another sentence pattern.
* Contains a subject plus a verb and any objects, any modifiers.
*It either stands alone or could stand alone.
--Example: May studied in the library for her final exam.

===Subordinate clause===

*Pattern like a full sentence (has subjects and verbs) but functions within a sentence.
*Can function as a noun, adjective or adverb.
*Can not stand alone as a complete sentence.
*Sometimes called a dependent clause.
--Example: After May studied in the library for her final exam, she went home.

===Complement Clause===
*Ordinary --- If you examine the structure of the entire sentence, you will see that this complement clause is taking the place of a direct object.  This is common for ordinary complement clauses.  Certain verbs, which your text goes into in detail, allow this. 
-- Example:     I know [that James went to Yale]. 
*Noun --- In a noun complement clause construction, the complement clause occurs after a noun.  The number of nouns that can be used in this construction is limited.  Some examples are 'the fact', 'the rumor', 'the suggestion', 'the idea', etc. 
-- Example:  I love the idea [that chimps can talk]. 
*Adjective --- In an adjective complement clause construction the clause occurs after an adjective. 
-- Example:  I am pleased [that George went to the party].

===The Relative Clause===
A relative clause--also called an adjective or adjectival clause--will meet three requirements. First, it will contain a subject and verb. Next, it will begin with a relative pronoun [who, whom, whose, that, or which] or a relative adverb [when, where, or why]. Finally, it will function as an adjective, answering the questions What kind? How many? or Which one? The relative clause will follow one of these two patterns:

 Relative Pronoun [or Relative Adverb]  +  Subject  +  Verb  =   Incomplete Thought  

 Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Subject]  +  Verb  =  Incomplete Thought

===Examples=== 

; Simple sentence
: One independent clause with no subordinate clauses.  It does not contain more than one full sentence pattern.
:: ''Without love, life would be empty.''
: This sentence contains a subject (life), a verb (would be) and 2 types of modifiers (Without love and empty).

; Compound sentence
: Composed of two or more independent clauses with no subordinate clauses.  The two clauses are usually joined by a comma and a conjunction or a semicolon.
:: ''Together we stand, but united we fall.''
: This sentence contains 2 clauses which are joined by &quot;but&quot;.

; Complex sentence
: Composed of one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.
:: ''They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.''
: &quot;that sow in tears&quot; is the subordinate clause.

; Compound-complex sentence
: Contains at least two independent clauses and at least one subordinate clause.
:: ''Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.''
: This sentence contains two independent clauses (one before and one after the comma) and each independent clause contains a subordinate clause (&quot;what you eat&quot; and &quot;what you are&quot;).

==Sentence Purpose==

* '''Declarative sentence''' - used to make a statement
*: ''My dog barks at everything.''

* '''Imperative sentence''' - used to make a request or demand
*: ''Give me that.''

* '''Interrogative sentence''' - used to ask a question
*: ''What are you doing?''

* '''Exclamatory sentence''' - used to make an exclamation
*: ''I don't want that!''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of Feminist Philosophy==

The very beginnings of Western philosophy have included discussions about the status of women. Plato spoke of women's roles in ''The Republic''. He claimed that while there are some obvious physical differences between men and women, there are some women that are taller, stronger, etc. than most men. Furthermore, Plato claimed that there are no differences between men and women's ability to understand reality and make reasonable judgements about it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm|last=Kemerling|first=Garth|date=2006-08-01|title=Plato: The Republic 5-10|accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Plato's student, Aristotle held a very low opinion of women. Aristotle in his work, ''Politics'' claims that women ought to be treated as property. Furthermore, the best a woman can achieve is to rear a fine family. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xari.htm|last=Roberts|first=Andrew |date=2006-08-01|title=Aristotle on reason, the state, slavery and women |accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics of Interest to Feminist Philosophers==

Feminism within philosophy is a very large field; the topic encompasses most, if not all, disciplines that philosophy covers. Feminists have an interest in subjects ranging from Aesthetics to the Philosophy of Religion, thus it would be dishonest to say that Feminist philosophers study one particular subject or intersection. We can, however, safely say that Feminist philosophers are interested in how gender, race and class (among other things) affect and are affected by philosophy. 

Below is a general list of topics that have prominent Feminist interest.

===Analytic Philosophy===

===Contenental Philosophy===

===Philosophy of Science===

===Aesthetics===

===Ethics===

==Famous Feminist Philosophers==

===John Stuart Mill===

===Simon de Bouviour===

==Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL)==
*''Please see [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/DLBCL#Primary_Mediastinal_Large_B-cell|DLBCL/PMLBCL]] section for background information


'''''Chemotherapy regimens:''''' DA-EPOCH-R, MACOP-B, VACOP-B, NHL-15, R-CHOP

'''''Treatments:'''''

*'''Dunleavy, 2012''' (NCI) PMID 23574119 -- &quot;Dose-adjusted EPOCH-rituximab therapy in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.&quot; (N Engl J Med. 2013 Apr 11;368(15):1408-16)
**Phase 2 prospective prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) and filgrastim without radiotherapy in 51 patients with untreated primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  
**Outcome: The patients had a median age of 30 years (range, 19 to 52) and a median tumor diameter of 11 cm; 59% were women. During a median of 5 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 93%, and the overall survival rate was 97%. Among the 16 patients who were involved in the retrospective analysis at another center, over a median of 3 years of follow-up, the event-free survival rate was 100%, and no patients received radiotherapy. No late morbidity or cardiac toxic effects were found in any patients. After follow-up ranging from 10 months to 14 years, all but 2 of the 51 patients (4%) who received DA-EPOCH-R alone were in complete remission. The 2 remaining patients received radiotherapy and were disease-free at follow-up.
**Conclusion: Therapy with DA-EPOCH-R obviated the need for radiotherapy in patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.

*'''Padova, 2007''' (Italy) PMID 17379431 -- &quot;Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma: results of intensive chemotherapy regimens (MACOP-B/VACOP-B) plus involved field radiotherapy on 53 patients. A single institution experience.&quot; (Mazzarotto R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Jul 1;68(3):823-9.)
**Retrospective. 53 consecutive patients with PMLBCL (90% Stage I-II) treated with induction [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#Pro-MACE-MOPP|ProMACE-MOPP]] (n=2), [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#MACOP-B|MACOP-B]] (n=11), and [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#VACOP-B|VACOP-B]] (n=40), followed by IFRT. RT started 3-4 after chemo, modified mantle and SCV if involved at diganosis. Dose 30.6/17 - 39.6/22 (mean 36/20). Treatment completed in 80%. Median F/U 7.8 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS 93%, DFS 87%. Response after chemo: CR 38%, PR 57%. If PR, 92% obtained CR after IFRT
**Conclusion: Intensive chemo + IFRT efficacious; IFRT plays a pivotal role in inducing CR

*'''Verona, 2004''' (Italy)(1982-1999) PMID 14735179 -- &quot;Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL): long-term results from a retrospective multicentre Italian experience in 138 patients treated with CHOP or MACOP-B/VACOP-B.&quot; (Todeschini G, Br J Cancer. 2004 Jan 26;90(2):372-6.)
**Retrospective. 13 Italian centers. 138 patients with PMLBCL treated with [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations#CHOP|CHOP]] (n=43) or [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MACOP-B/VACOP-B]] (n=95). 76% patients in CR received IFRT
**Outcome: CR CHOP 51% vs. MACOP-B/VACOP-B 80% (SS); EFS 40% vs. 76% (SS). IFRT improved outcome, irrespective of chemo
**Conclusion: MACOP-B/VACOP-B better than CHOP; consolidation IFRT improves outcome in CR patients

'''''Clinicopathologic Studies:'''''
*'''Nebraska''' - PMID 10071267, 1999 -- &quot;Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma: a clinicopathologic study of 43 patients from the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group.&quot; (Abou-Elella AA, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):784-90.)
**Conclusion: The clinical features of PMLBL do not appear to be significantly different from those of nonmediastinal DLBL. Younger median age of 42 yrs is much less than median age for nonmediastinal DLBL.

'''''Reviews:'''''
*'''Savage, 2006''' - PMID 16720849, 2006 &amp;mdash; &quot;Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.&quot; Savage KJ. Oncologist. 2006 May;11(5):488-95.

==Testicular==
*'''International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group 10 [IELSG-10]''' - Phase II - R-CHOP, IT-MTX, RT to contralateral testis
**Multinational. 53 pts, Stage I-II primary testicular lymphoma. R-CHOP21 x 6-8, 4 doses of intrathecal MTX, RT 30 Gy to the contralateral testis (for all pts). RT 30-36 Gy given to the pelvis for Stage II.
**'''2011''' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21646602 PMID: 21646602]-- &quot;First-Line Treatment for Primary Testicular Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma With Rituximab-CHOP, CNS Prophylaxis, and Contralateral Testis Irradiation: Final Results of an International Phase II Trial.&quot; (Vitolo U, JCO online before print June 6, 2011.)
***Median f/u 65 mo. All pts received R-CHOP, 50 received CNS prophylaxis, 47 received testicular RT. 5-yr PFS 74% and OS 85%. 10 pts with relapses: 2 in LNs, 5 in extranodal organs, 3 in CNS. 5-yr CNS relapse rate 6%. No contralateral testis relapses. 10 pts died (6 from lymphoma). 
***Conclusion: Good outcome for PTL with chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis and RT to the contralateral testis. CNS prophylaxis deserves further investigation.

==Primary Bone Lymphoma==
*'''Rare Cancer Network; 2012''' (1987-2008) PMID  22079728 -- &quot;Early-Stage Primary Bone Lymphoma: A Retrospective, Multicenter Rare Cancer Network (RCN) Study.&quot; (Cai L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 May 1;83(1):284-91.) -- Median f/u 41 m.
**Multi-institutional. 116 pts, Stages I-II (I-80%, II-20%). Pathology was re-classified using the WHO classification (DLBCL in 78%).
**75% received chemoradiotherapy. 88% received chemo (+/- RT). Chemo was CHOP in 68%, R-CHOP in 32%. 
**CR in 74%. LF in 10%. LC: 5-yr 92%, 10-yr 80%. OS: 5-yr 76%, 10-yr 72%. LSS (lymphoma-specific survival): 78% at 5 and 10 yrs.
**Distant progression in 15% at a median of 7 months. 
**By RT dose: LF 12% (for &lt;40 Gy) vs 8% (&gt;40 Gy); NS. LF was in-field in 50%.
**Independent prognostic features: IPI score, RT dose, CR, and chemo.
**Conclusion: Good prognosis. Chemotherapy followed by RT is superior to rt-&gt;chemo. RT plays a role in local control. Better outcome for more than 6 chemotherapy cycles and more than 40 Gy RT.

*'''Italy; 2004''' (1983-2001) PMID 15183479 -- &quot;Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the bone: treatment and analysis of prognostic factors for Stage I and Stage II.&quot; (Barbieri E, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 1;59(3):760-4.) -- Median f/u 149 m (12 yr)
**77 pts with Stage I (44) or Stage II (33) primary bone lymphoma. All pts had RT to median 40 Gy; 67 pts had chemo.
**CR in 94.8%. Relapse in 18.2% at median of 23 months. 15-yr DFS 76.6%, OS 88.3%. 
**Prognostic factors: Age &lt;40 was the only significant factor for worse DFS. 
**Conclusion: &quot;In PLB the CMT seems to produce a better outcome than RT alone; that still remains the best treatment for local disease control. Radiation therapy alone should be reserved for mandibular tumors, which are usually very small and earlier diagnosed.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important for designers of mass-market User Interfaces to keep in mind that not all users are equally computer savvy. A mass-market operating system, such as Windows, has amongst its user base both beginners, as well as experienced power-users. What makes an OS interface more user-friendly for a first-time user may not be user-friendly to a power-user. For instance, the 'Clippy' assistant in Office may be of assistance to first-time users. Yet it is often described as annoying for seasoned users of office suite software, and in many cases may detract from the usability of the software.

As a rule, operating systems meant for more advanced users have fewer graphical configuration tools, and may have more of a focus on speed than looks.  As an example, Slackware Linux has virtually no configuration tools and so is seen as a power-user's operating system, while Ubuntu has most tasks automated and so is seen as a user-friendly operating system.

Nearly all operating systems, even if they have a easy-to-use GUI, also allow users to go around the GUI to hand-tweak the configuration.
&quot;It is a significant advantage to all users if advanced users can make hand-tweaked modifications to config files when serious problems arise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wiki: PreferenceEditorPattern]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have the idea of making the computer present one user interface by default to new users, then later present a different &quot;advanced user interface&quot; to &quot;advanced users&quot;.
This is generally regarded as a well-meaning mistake.&lt;ref&gt;

==Nasal NK/T lymphoma==
===History===
Before 2000, NK/T lymphomas were not a clearly-defined entity and were lumped together with other lymphomas of the nasal cavity.
===Clinical features===
NK cell has worse prognosis than B or T cell lymphoma.
&lt;br&gt;Nasal lymphomas in Western populations have a better prognosis than in Asian countries. This may be due to a higher proportion of NK lymphomas or EBV-associated tumors in Asia.

*Hong Kong, 1998 - PMID 9440725 &amp;mdash; &quot;Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the nose and nasopharynx: clinical features, tumor immunophenotype, and treatment outcome in 113 patients.&quot; Cheung MM et al. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):70-7. 
**113 pts.

===Treatment===
====Overview====
RT is recommended as the primary treatment. Consolidative CT should be considered for pts with adverse risk factors or Stage IIE disease.

====Modality====
*'''Japan, JCOG0211''' - phase I/II
**33 pts total; 23 pts on phase II. Stage IE-IIE. Concurrent chemo/RT with 50 Gy and DeVIC (dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, carboplatin) x 3 courses.
**'''2009''' PMID 19805668 -- &quot;Phase I/II study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for localized nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma: Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study JCOG0211.&quot; (Yamaguchi M, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Nov 20;27(33):5594-600.)
***27 pts treated to recommended dose from phase I. Median f/u 32 months. 2-yr OS 78%. (Historical control of RT alone: 45%) 77% with CR, 1 pt with PR.
**Conclusion: chemo/RT is safe and effective

*'''Korea''' - phase II
**30 pts. Stage IE-IIE. Concurrent chemo/RT with median 40 Gy and weekly cisplatin. Followed by 3 cycles of VIPD (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, dexamethasone).
**'''2009''' PMID 19884539 -- &quot;Phase II trial of concurrent radiation and weekly cisplatin followed by VIPD chemotherapy in newly diagnosed, stage IE to IIE, nasal, extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma: Consortium for Improving Survival of Lymphoma study.&quot; (Kim SJ, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec 10;27(35):6027-32.)
***Response rate to cisplatin+RT: 100% (73% CR, 27% PR). Overall CR rate (after VIPD): 80%. 
***3-yr PFS 85%, OS 86%. 
**Conclusion: recommend concurrent chemo/RT

**Retrospective. 100 pts. Various types (many were T-cell). RT alone or chemo-&gt;RT.

*MDACC, 1997 (1947-93) - PMID 9241082 &amp;mdash; &quot;Lymphoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses: improved outcome and altered prognostic factors with combined modality therapy.&quot; Logsdon MD et al. Cancer. 1997 Aug 1;80(3):477-88. 
**''Note:'' per the Working Formulation, most were diffuse large cell type. Immunophenotype was not available for most patients.
**Retrospective. 70 pts. Western population. 
**Improved FFP in those treated with CMT vs RT alone.

**All pts are NK/T (CD56+). 79 pts (61 chemo+RT, 18 RT alone). CR in 68.4%. Of those, 44% relapsed. 5-yr DFS 35.5%, OS 37.9%. No difference between those treated with RT alone vs combined modality.

*South Korea, 2004 (1976-98) - PMID 15234048 &amp;mdash; &quot;Angiocentric T-cell and NK/T-cell lymphomas: radiotherapeutic viewpoints.&quot; Koom WS et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 15;59(4):1127-37.
**102 pts. RT alone to median dose of 45 Gy. 72% CR, but most of those experienced relapse, and 47% of all pts had local failure.
**Conclusion: high local failure rate with RT alone. Plateau in dose response curve around 54 Gy.

*China, 2005 (1983-2003) - PMID 16382127 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy as primary treatment for stage IE and IIE nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.&quot; Li YX et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 1;24(1):181-9. 
**Retrospective. 105 pts. Stage IE and IIE. Pts received RT alone or combined modality. Initial RT resulted in CR of 83% vs CR of 20% for initial chemotherapy. OS and PFS were similar for RT alone and CMT.
**Conclusion: recommend RT as primary therapy. Addition of CT does not lead to improved survival.

====RT dose====
Doses &gt;50 Gy are recommended.

*'''Japan''', Sakata - PMID 9208902 - recommend &gt;50 Gy

== Overview ==

'''''Dementors''''' are the guards of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban Prison]]. It is difficult to determine what their features are, because they conceal themselves completely under flowing black cloaks.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At its first appearance, a Dementor is described as a &quot;cloaked figure&quot;. &quot;Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood.&quot; When we first see it, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we do see a part of it: there was &quot;a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, greyish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water; the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.&quot;

Dementors are dark creatures that consume human happiness, creating an ambiance of coldness, darkness, misery and despair. Because of their power to drain happiness and hope from humans, they have been set the duty of being guards at Azkaban, where they prevent the prisoners from having the will or ability to escape.

This creature has the property that only wizards can see it. Muggles can still feel them, though. Its only known ability, besides the happiness drain, is the ability to perform the &quot;Dementor's Kiss&quot;, which is the act of extracting the human soul through the mouth, leaving nothing more than a living body. This process is irreversible.

They &quot;are among the foulest creature that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life,&quot; as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]].

The only spell we are aware of which is able to repel these creatures, is called the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when Harry asserts that the Patronus charm is the only way to battle Dementors, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] tells him that he is wrong; but this supposed different way of tackling Dementors is never described.

== Analysis ==

From his first exposure to them, Harry is much more sensitive to the effects of Dementors than anyone else – Harry alone, of the six people present in the train compartment, passes out when the Dementor enters to search it. Harry is very much afraid that this is a display of weakness, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 10|just before Christmas]], when he discusses the matter with Professor Lupin. Lupin explains that Harry is more deeply affected because Dementors work by extracting good memories, leaving nothing but the bad recollections, and Harry has a much grimmer history than anyone else.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] has managed to block the attempt to place Dementors inside the school, but cannot prevent the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] from positioning them outside the grounds, at all the known entry points to the school. Their stated purpose at that time is to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] from entering the castle. One must wonder how the Ministry believed that would work, as Sirius had already escaped from Azkaban, and so must have some way of evading the Dementors. Possibly this is just the Ministry doing anything so that it appears to be doing something, as it so often does.

One also wonders why the Dementors would stay on as Azkaban guards, when there are so many people elsewhere in the world for them to suck emotion out of. Perhaps it was a mistake allowing so many of them to visit Hogwarts and discover exactly how thin the takings were in the prisoners at Azkaban, relative to the rest of the world. It is certainly true that they abandoned Azkaban with great alacrity in the middle of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

While it is never stated, there is an implication that the Dementors are a created being, rather than one that occurs naturally. The statement in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], that the Dementors are breeding, leads us to believe that they are of natural origin. Perhaps, like guard dogs, they were created from a naturally-occurring magical creature, possibly the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Lethifold|Lethifold]], by selective breeding methods, or by means of magical enhancement of the traits in which Wizards were interested.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the Minister for Magic attributes the gloominess of the weather to escaped Dementors breeding and multiplying. Why are Harry and Ron unable to recognize this?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Although the Dementors leave Azkaban in the middle of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' to join [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], one has to wonder, given their earlier actions, whose side they are on from the beginning.

All through ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', though the Dementors are nominally seeking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], they seem to have fixated on Harry, to the point of trying to administer the Kiss to him rather than Sirius when both of them are trapped.

At the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', the Dementor that Cornelius Fudge has brought along with him, &quot;for his protection,&quot; administers the Kiss to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] before Fudge can interrogate him. If the Dementors had already allied with Voldemort, this would be sensible as it would increase the delay before Voldemort's return would be made public. Of course, the Dementor could have recognized Crouch as an escaped Azkaban inmate; however, that is unlikely, as Crouch had been replaced in Azkaban by his mother some ten years previous to our story, and the substitution had not then been noticed.

The two Dementors who attack Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] near [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] are apparently under orders from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], or at least so she claims [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 32|near the end of that book]]. There is some question at the time of the attack as to whether Umbridge was actually being controlled by Voldemort, as Harry's scar did later twinge at one point when she held his hand. Sirius, in conversation with Harry, dismisses that idea, though, saying that as bad as Umbridge is, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order]] does not believe her to be controlled by Voldemort.

From the long sequence of things done by the Dementors that directly hinders the Wizarding world, one must conclude that they are more inclined to follow Voldemort than the good Wizards, and additionally that at the best of times, Wizarding control over the Dementors is very tenuous indeed. It may be an error to assume that Dementors are evil, however. It is more likely that they are amoral, possibly having insufficient intelligence to have any real concept of morality, and simply follow the main chance. Harry is targeted, not because he is Harry, but because he is, to Dementors, a better source of the energy they require than Sirius. Barty is attacked only because he is helpless and a suitable energy source. And the only reason the Dementors choose to follow Voldemort is because he frees them from their duty to Azkaban, allowing them access to the richer pickings on the mainland.

It is a shame, perhaps, that Snape never elucidates his comment about there being a better spell to eliminate Dementors. If they are breeding, as Fudge says at the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', then they will likely need to have their numbers cut down. As it is, we don't know if there is any method of effectively doing that; the Patronus charm will repel them, but we don't know of anything that will destroy them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As more sophisticated tools have been developed, our understanding of the universe has improved. Some proposed models of the universe were proven wrong, and other ideas are still with us today.

==Measuring distances in the universe==

The distances at the scale of the universe are gigantic, and our everyday metres and even kilometres are too small to be used. We need to use units that are more appropriate for large distances. Often, other units are convenient to use because of the way they are measured.

===The light-year===

One light-year is defined as the distance light travels in one year. As you know, light travels at &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{8}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;ms^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and so the distance it covers in one year is enormous. One light year is approximately &lt;math&gt;10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; ''m''.

===The astronomical unit===

The astronomical unit is defined as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. It originates from the fact that it was possible to measure the distances of the planets, but only in multiples of the distance between the Earth and Sun. It is still useful today for distances within the solar system. It is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;1.5 \times 10^{11}&lt;/math&gt; ''m''.
[[Image:Parallax Example.png|308px|thumb|A simplified example of parallax.]]
===The parsec===

One parsec is simply the reciprocal of half the angle of parallax of a star, when observed from Earth at two opposite points of its orbit. Parallax is the apparent change in position of an object against a fixed background when the position of the observer changes, like how buildings seem to move faster than background hills when you're in a car. It is convenient to find from the measured angle, and is therefore used mainly for the distances of stars. This concept is covered in more detail in [[A-level Physics/Cosmology/Stars and Galaxies|Stars &amp; Galaxies]]. One parsec is approximately &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; ''m'', or 3.26 light-years.

==Overview of the solar system==
[[Image:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|250px|The Solar System, showing the Sun, the planets, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and a comet.]]
Our solar system consists of the Sun, the planets and an asteroid belt. Additionally, there are comets that have highly elliptical orbits, and return to the solar system at regular intervals.

===Planets===

There are eight planets orbiting the Sun (Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet), which is at the centre of the solar system. Most planets also have natural satellites, or moons, orbiting them. The table below outlines the main features of the planets, relative to the Earth:

===Asteroid belt===

There is a concentration of small, rocky asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, which is known as the asteroid belt. There are hundreds of thousands of these planetoids orbiting the Sun, and are sometimes called minor planets.

===Comets===

Comets are lumps of rock, frozen water, methane and ammonia that orbit the Sun, and are typically only a few kilometres in diameter. They have very eccentric (elliptical) orbits and therefore vary greatly in their distance from the Sun. When they are near the Sun, they have long tails of approximately 1AU, due to the Sun's radiation.

==The progress in the understanding of the universe==

The accepted model of the Solar System has been subject to great controversy over the decades. In the old '''geocentric''' model, the Earth was originally placed in the centre of the Solar System, and had the other planets and the Sun orbiting it. Now, the accepted model places the Sun in the centre, with the Earth and other planets orbiting around it.

===Copernicus===
[[Image:Retrograde-motion-of-mars.png|right|thumb|300px|The retrograde motion of Mars]]
[[w:Nicolaus Copernicus|Nicolaus Copernicus]] found the old '''geocentric''' model unnecessarily complicated. Instead of having the Earth in the centre of the universe, he decided to place the Sun in the centre, which we now call the '''heliocentric''' model. This model could very easily explain the movement of the planets and the Sun across the sky, and in particular the '''retrograde motion''' of Mars, where it would appear to move &quot;backwards&quot; across the sky for several weeks. This retrograde motion of Mars was previously explained by '''epicycles''' where it would &quot;loop-the-loop&quot; around at certain points. With Copernicus' new model, it was explained that since the Earth was closer to the Sun than Mars, there will be sections where the Earth will &quot;overtake&quot; Mars, and will make Mars apparently move backwards across the sky.

====Opposition to Copernicus====

Copernicus' heliocentric model was rejected by most people mainly because of religious beliefs at the time, and although it seemed to simplify the motion of the planets, it was less accurate than the geocentric model at fitting the observed movements of the planets.

People also argued that if the Earth was moving, the stars would have a detectable parallax. Copernicus claimed that the stars were too far away to detect any parallax, and with more sensitive equipment, he has now been proved correct. Another argument against the heliocentric model was that objects all fall towards the Earth, and so it must be the centre of the universe. This was the intuitive conclusion before Newton revolutionised our ideas about motion.

===Kepler===
[[Image:Kepler-first-law.png|right|thumb|150px|An elliptical orbit with the Sun at one of the foci]]
Johannes Kepler improved upon Copernicus' original model by using elliptical orbits instead of circular ones. He devised three laws of planetary motion:

====Kepler's first law====

Kepler found that the planets fit the observed pattern better with the heliocentric model if they travelled in ellipses, not circles, and had the Sun at one of the foci of these ellipses. Therefore Kepler's first law states:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Kepler's second law====
[[Image:Kepler-second-law.svg|left|thumb|150px|Equal areas are covered in equal amounts of time]]
Now that the planets had elliptical orbits, it would not make sense for them to travel at the same speed at all points of their orbit. The planets would speed up nearer the Sun, and move slower when they were further away from the Sun. Kepler observed that the imaginary triangle formed between the planet at two points in its orbit and the Sun always had the same area provided the two points of the planets orbit had the same time difference between them. From this it follows that a planets orbit is faster nearer the Sun than further away from it. Kepler's second law states that:

The line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:Semimajoraxis.png|right|thumb|The semi-major axis of an ellipse]]

====Kepler's third law====

Kepler realised that the distance of a planet from the Sun and its orbital period were related by the formula: &lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto d^3&lt;/math&gt;, where T is the time taken for one orbit, and d is the distance from the Sun, although it is actually the length of the semi-major axis (which is half of the longest diameter of the elipse).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the distance from the Sun.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Galileo===
[[Image:The Phases of Venus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Phases of Venus.]]
Galileo Galilei was the first person to use a telescope to look at the night sky. He was able to view many things that weren't visible to the naked eye, such as the imperfectness of the surface of the moon, and the fact that there were many faint stars in the sky. Both of these supported Copernicus' ideas.

====Galileo and Venus====

When Galileo observed Venus with his telescope. he noticed that it went through phases, like the Moon. He also noticed that when Venus was a crescent, it was much larger than when it was full. This observation was evidence that Venus was orbiting around the Sun and not Earth.

====Galileo and Jupiter's Moons====

Galileo also observed four objects orbiting Jupiter, which are now known as the [[w:Galilean moons|Galilean moons]] They supported the view that not everything orbits the Earth.

===Newton's universal law of gravitation===

When Issac Newton created his [[A-level_Physics/Forces%2C_Fields_and_Energy/Gravitational_fields#Newton.27s_ideas_of_gravity|universal law of gravitation]], he attempted to show that Kepler's observations of planetary motion agreed with it. This was significant evidence to show that he was correct.

Newton's law of gravitation can be used to give a formula for the planets in the form &lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto d^3&lt;/math&gt;:

The force of gravitational attraction between the Sun and a planet is equal to the centripetal force required to keep the planet in its orbit:
:&lt;math&gt;F=G\frac {m_1 m_2}{d^2} = \frac{m v^2}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The period of the planets orbit can be given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Time\ taken = \frac {distance}{velocity}&lt;/math&gt;

Where the distance is the circumference of a circle, &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \times d&lt;/math&gt; (note that ''d'' is distance from Sun, and is therefore the radius, not the diameter). This gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2 \pi d}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

Which we can re-arrange to make ''v'' the subject and substitute into &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; in the centripetal force equation:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{2 \pi d}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 d^2}{T^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G\frac {m_1 m_2}{d^2} = \frac{4 \pi^2 m d}{T^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating ''m'', the mass of the planet, and tidying up:

:&lt;math&gt;G \frac{m T^2}{4 \pi^2 d^3} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

And finally, making &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; the subject:

:&lt;math&gt;T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{Gm} d^3&lt;/math&gt;

We now have a formula in the form &lt;math&gt;T^2 \propto d^3&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\frac {4 \pi^2}{Gm}&lt;/math&gt; as the constant of proportionality, where ''m'' is the mass of the Sun.

====The discovery of Neptune====

In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published very accurate observations in the orbit of Uranus. However, soon after this, the orbit of Uranus was observed to deviate from the published values. In 1845 John Adams, using Newton's universal law of gravitation, calculated  the orbit of another planet outside of Uranus whose gravity would account for the '''perturbations''' in Uranus' orbit. Neptune was discovered in its predicted position a year later. Pluto was discovered in a similar way, since it was causing further perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.

====Problems encountered with Newton's theory====

Although Newton's theory was very successful in explaining the motion of the planets, and had even been used to discover unknown planets, there were still some problems with it:

*The orbit of Mercury was observed to have a different orbit to the one predicted by the theory. This has now been resolved by Einstein's [[A-level_Physics/Cosmology/Relativity|general theory of relativity]].
*If every object in the universe attracts each other, then the entire universe should have collapsed because of the gravitational attraction. To solve this, Newton came up with the idea that the universe was infinitely large, and that matter was uniformly spread throughout. This led to its own problems, though, namely [[A-level_Physics/Cosmology/Structure of the universe|Olber's paradox]], which states that an infinitely large universe will always have a star on any given line of sight, and so the night sky should actually be bright. This has been resolved with the observations of an [[A-level_Physics/Cosmology/Structure of the universe|expanding universe]] by Edwin Hubble.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Calabrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists ==

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication research and the development of communication theory.  Information exchange is a basic human function in which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty.  Uncertainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication.  Through the development of URT, these scholars pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty research.

Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153).  The study of information is basic to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical research in the field of interpersonal communication.  URT places the role of communication into the central focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).  The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of interpersonal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social sciences.

== The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview ==

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field.  Interpersonal communication is most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology.  Prior to the 1960s, only a modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication.  Heath and Bryant (2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960, scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted to study it as a significant and unique aspect of human behavior” (p. 59).

The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of an interpersonal field.  Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well.  Research trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved through effective communication (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000).

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion, social influence, and small group processes.  Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, balance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005).  Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology, played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider, Kelley, and Hovland. 

By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction, relational development, and relational control.  This was influenced by the research of such scholars as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut.  During the later part of the decade and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.  Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416).

Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as a function of developing relationships.  Research into interpersonal communication theory typically focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships.  It has been recognized that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975).  Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole.  This chapter strives to focus on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication.  Their work is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our understanding of interpersonal processes.

== Defining Uncertainty ==

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of communication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined and studied.  One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information theory.  Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.  Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work also contributed to the development of URT.

Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the information theorists as well as Heider's (1958) research in attribution.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100).  The greater the level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to predict behaviors and occurrences.

During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things that a stranger can believe or potentially say”

Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining relationships.  High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development.  Uncertainty can cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence (West &amp; Turner, 2000).  Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious to engage in initial interactions.  West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking.  In interactions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions.  When high uncertainty exists it is often difficult to reach this goal.

Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty and predictability can also inhibit a relationship.  Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too much certainty and predictability can deaden a relationship; too much uncertainty raises its costs to an unacceptable level. Relationship building is a dialectic of stability and change, certainty and uncertainty” (p. 271).  Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.  The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce uncertainly.

== Early Influences ==

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.  The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

=== Leon Festinger (1919-1989)===

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Iowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin.  Lewin, one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a substantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication.  After graduation, [[Festinger]] initially worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics.  After Lewin's death, Festinger worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research (Samelson, 2000).

Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed Lewin’s theories.  Several of Festinger's theories were highly influential on the emerging field of interpersonal communication and on the development of URT.  Festinger is best known for the theories of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison.  Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual.  Lewin foreshadowed CDT in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982).  CDT allows for three relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equilibrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another (West &amp; Turner, 2000).  Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and discomfort that individuals seek to reduce.

Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities.  To evaluate the self, the individual usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self.  This need for social comparison can result in conformity pressures (Trenholm &amp; Jensen, 2004).  Berger and Calabrese (1975) related social comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107).

Festinger received the Distinguished Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.  Festinger’s legacy is significant, and his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research.  Aronson (in Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).

=== Fritz Heider (1896-1988)===

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz.  During his time in Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Köhler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Lewin.  Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: “I want to pay tribute to [Lewin's] stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work” (Heider, 1958, p. vii).  In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).

Heider’s 1958 publication, ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations'', signified a major breakthrough in the study of interpersonal communication (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000).  At this point, social psychologists like Heider expanded their research to focus on interpersonal relations as an important field of study.  Though many social psychologists focused on behavior in interpersonal relations, their research served as a gateway for research examining communication in interpersonal relationships.  Heider’s text provided one of the first forums for discussing relational phenomena.

Heider’s work reflected Lewin’s cognitive approach to behavior.  Heider (1958) focused on theories in cognitive consistency, emphasizing that individuals prefer when their cognitions are in agreement with each other.  Heider examined how individuals perceive and evaluate the actions and behaviors of others, a focus reexamined in Berger and Calabrese’s development of URT.  Heider stated: “persons actively seek to predict and explain the actions of others” (Berger &amp; Bradac, 1982, p. 29).  Heider’s theory of “naïve psychology” suggested that individuals act as observers and analyzers of human behavior in everyday life.  Individuals gather information that helps them to predict and explain human behavior.  “The naïve factor analysis of action permits man to give meaning to action, to influence the actions of others as well as of himself, and to predict future actions” (Heider, 1958, p. 123).  

When examining motivations in interpersonal relations, Heider (1958) found that affective significance is greatly determined by causal attribution.  Heider states: “Thus, our reactions will be different according to whether we think a person failed primarily because he lacked adequate ability or primarily because he did not want to carry out the actions” (1958, p. 123).  The condition of motivation becomes the focus and is relied on for making judgments and also interpreting the action.

Heider was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  His influence continues to grow after his death in 1988.

=== Claude E. Shannon (1916-2001) and Warren Weaver (1894-1978)===

Claude E. Shannon received his B.S. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Shannon worked for the National Research Council, the National Defense Research Committee, and Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he developed the mathematical theory of communication, now known as information theory, with Warren Weaver.  Shannon went on to teach at MIT until his death in 2001.  During his lifetime Shannon was awarded the Leibmann Prize, Ballantine Medal, Who's Who Life Achievement Prize, and the Kyoto Prize (“Claude Elwood Shannon”, 2002).

Warren Weaver received his B.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin.  Weaver worked as faculty at Throop College, California Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin, and served in World War One.  Weaver was also an active member of the Rockefeller Foundation, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and Salk Institute for Biological Studies, serving in many leadership roles.  He was awarded UNESCO's Kalinga Prize before his death in 1978 (Reingold, 2000).

Shannon and Weaver significantly contributed to the systematic approach to the study of communication.  Both theorists were engineers who sought to explain information exchange through cybernetic processes.  They were the first to effectively model information, as they sought to explain how to attain precise and efficient signal transmissions in the realm of telecommunications.  In their theory of information, Shannon and Weaver (1949) showed that the need to reduce uncertainty motivates individual’s communication behavior.  This concept was later extended by Berger and Calabrese (1975) in the development of URT. 

Information theory provided the connections from information to uncertainty and uncertainty to communication that facilitated the development of URT.  “Shannon &amp; Weaver’s (1949) approach stressed the conclusion that information is the number of messages needed to totally reduce uncertainty” (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000, p. 145). Individuals have a desire to reduce uncertainty and they are able to fulfill this need by increasing information.  Individuals increase information through communication (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949).  These concepts are further explored in the examination of information-seeking strategies in URT.

== Uncertainty in the Modern Era ==

=== Charles R. Berger: Biography ===	

Charles R. Berger received his B.S. from Pennsylvania State University and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Michigan State University.  After graduation, Berger worked at Illinois State University at Normal, Northwestern University, and the University of California at Davis, where he continues to work today as the chair of the Department of Communication.  Berger has been involved with the International Communication Association since the 1970s, is an active member of the National Communication Association, and belongs to such professional groups as the American Psychological Society, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and the Iowa Network for Personal Relationships (“Charles R. Berger”, 2001).

Berger has published on a variety of topics in interpersonal communication including: uncertainty reduction, strategic interaction, information-seeking, attribution, interpersonal attraction, social cognition, and apprehension.  In the past thirty-five years, Berger has published approximately forty articles appearing in the ''Communication Education, Communication Monographs, Communication Research, Communication Theory, Communication Quarterly, Communication Yearbook, Educational and Psychological Measurement, Human Communication Research, Journal of Communication, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology Journal of Social Issues, Journal of Personality, Personal Relationship Issues, Speech Monographs, Western Journal of Communication,'' and the ''Western Journal of Speech Communication''.  Berger has coauthored five books and contributed to over thirty other texts.  In 1982, Berger received the Golden Anniversary Book Award, presented by the Speech Communication Association, for his text: ''Language and Social Knowledge''. 

=== Richard J. Calabrese: Biography ===

Richard J. Calabrese received his B.A. from Loyola University, two M.A. degrees from Bradley University, and his Ph.D. from Northwestern University.  Calabrese has taught at Bradley University, the University of Illinois at Urban, and Bowling Green University.  Calabrese became a professor in communication at Dominican University in River Forest, Illinois, in 1967, where he continues to work today.  Currently, Calabrese is the director of the Master of Science in Organization Management Program at Dominican University and also a consultant for organizational communication (“Richard Joseph Calabrese”, 2001).

Calabrese is a member of the International Association of Business Communicators, the Speech Communication Association, and is involved with the National Communication Association.  Calabrese is the coauthor of ''Communication and Education Skills for Dietetics Professionals''.

=== A Theory of Uncertainty Reduction: “Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication” (1975). ===

In 1971, Berger became an assistant professor of communication at Northwestern University.  During this time, Calabrese studied under Berger, receiving his Ph.D. in 1973.  In 1975, Berger and Calabrese published “Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication,” which serves as the foundation of URT.  This article inspired a wave of new research examining the role of uncertainty in communication.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) formed URT, also known as initial interaction theory, to explain the role of communication in reducing uncertainty in initial interactions and the development of interpersonal relationships. 

The theory was developed, like other interpersonal theories before it (Heider, 1958), with the goal of allowing the communicator the ability to predict and explain initial interactions.  Though Berger and Calabrese did not explore the realm of subsequent interaction, they did strongly recommend that future research should investigate the application of the framework of URT to developed relationships.  Especially in initial encounters, there exists a high degree of uncertainty given that a number of possible alternatives exist in the situation (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949).  But individuals can use communication to reduce this uncertainty.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) maintained that “communication behavior is one vehicle through which such predictions and explanations are themselves formulated” (p.101).  Individuals have the ability to decrease uncertainty by establishing predictable patterns of interaction.  Because of this, reducing uncertainty can help foster the development of relationships.

Berger and Calabrese (1975) found that uncertainty was related to seven other communication and relational-focused concepts: verbal output, nonverbal warmth, information seeking, self-disclosure, reciprocity, similarity, and liking.  From those concepts, the researchers introduced a collection of axioms, or propositions, supported by past uncertainty research.  Each axiom states a relationship between a communication concept and uncertainty.  From this basis of axioms, the theorists were able to use deductive logic to infer twenty-one theorems that comprise the theory of uncertainty reduction (West &amp; Turner, 2000).  The procedure used to develop the axioms and theorems was adopted from Blalock (1969).  A complete list of the axioms and theorems of URT is available in Appendix A. 

Central to URT is the supposition that in initial interactions, an individual’s primary concern is to decrease uncertainty and increase predictability regarding the behaviors of the self and the communicative partner.  This idea is based on Heider's (1958) notion that individuals seek to make sense out of the events he perceives (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975).  Individuals must be able to engage in proactive and retroactive strategies to learn how to predict what will happen and also explain what has already happened.

Heath and Bryant (2000) stated: “Uncertainty-reduction theory is a powerful explanation for communication because it operates in all contexts to help explain why people communicate as they do” (p. 271).  The impact of Berger and Calabrese (1975) on the field of interpersonal communication was and continues to be prolific.  In the past thirty years, this article has generated a plethora of research, changing the way that relationships are explored and analyzed.

=== Expansions on Uncertainty Reduction ===

Although URT was primarily formed to explain behavior in initial interactions, its application has since been expanded to incorporate all levels of interpersonal relationships.  “Uncertainties are ongoing in relationships, and thus the process of uncertainty reduction is relevant in developed relationships as well as in initial interactions” (West &amp; Turner, 2000, p. 141).  The following section will examine uncertainty reduction research since its introduction in 1975.

==== A. Charles Berger ====

Since its conception, Berger has produced a plethora of research expanding URT to better fit the dynamic nature of interpersonal relations.  Berger (1979) established that three predeceasing conditions must exist for an individual to reduce uncertainty.  These motivations to reduce uncertainty include: a potential for costs or rewards, deviations from expected behavior, and the possibility of future interaction.

In 1982, Berger teamed up with James J. Bradac, formerly of University of California at Santa Barbara (1980-2004), to publish a book devoted to uncertainty reduction research.  Their text, titled ''Language and Social Knowledge: Uncertainty in Interpersonal Relations'', was also edited by Howard Giles, originator of Communication Accommodation Theory and also faculty of UCSB.  In this text, the authors focused on the function of communication, and specifically language, as a proponent for reducing uncertainty.

Berger and Bradac (1982) proposed six axioms that built on URT’s original seven axioms to extend the relationship between uncertainty reduction and language.  Through the use of these axioms the authors specifically examined the role of language as an uncertainty reducing agent.   The authors further arranged uncertainty into two categories: cognitive uncertainty and behavioural uncertainty (Berger &amp; Bradac, 1982).  Cognitive uncertainty refers to uncertainty associated with beliefs and attitudes.  Behavioural uncertainty refers to uncertainty regarding the possible behaviors in a situation.  This categorization helped researchers identify the origins of uncertainty, which resulted in an increased ability to address the discomfort produced by uncertainty.

Berger and Bradac were cognitive that URT would be more useful if its influence was extended to include developed relationships as well as initial interaction.  Berger and Bradac (1982) alleviated this by stating that uncertainty reduction was critical to relational development, maintenance, and dissolution as well.  Berger again related his research to Heider (1958) by stating that individuals make casual attributions regarding communicative behavior.  As relationships further develop, individuals make retroactive and proactive attributions regarding a partner’s communication and behavior (Berger &amp; Bradac, 1982).  

Berger (1987) highlighted the role of costs and rewards in relationships by stating that “uncertainty reduction is a necessary condition for the definition of the currency of social exchange, and it is through communicative activity that uncertainty is reduced” (Berger, 1987, p. 57).  Berger (1987) also expanded URT by claiming that three types of information-seeking strategies are used to reduce uncertainty: passive, active, or interactive strategies.  This is related to the concepts of information theory (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949), emphasizing that increased information results in decreased uncertainty.

==== B. Developments from Other Researchers ====

The latter improvements made by Berger expanded the scope and value of URT.  Other researchers also made contributions to further developments of URT.  Since its introduction in 1975, URT has been expanded from a theory of relational development to one also important in established relationships. The following sections examine the contributions made by current interpersonal researchers to URT.

; William Douglas
: William Douglas was a student at Northwestern University while Berger was on faculty.  The two scholars collaborated in their study of uncertainty in 1982, and Douglas continued in the same vein of research after graduation.  Douglas’ research has appeared in major communication journals including: ''Communication Monographs, Communication Research, Human Communication Research, Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media'', and the ''Journal of Personal and Social Relationships''.  Douglas’ research in uncertainty accounts for individual differences when examining initial interactions.  Much of his research expanded previous work in initial interaction, examined global uncertainty, self-monitoring, and the relationship of verbal communication to uncertainty reduction.	
: Douglas (1987) examined one of the motivations to reduce uncertainty originally posited in Berger (1979): the anticipation of future interaction.  In this study, question-asking in situations of varying levels of anticipated future interaction was analyzed.  Douglas found that high levels of mutual question-asking occurred when the level of anticipated future interaction was moderate. This finding suggested that individuals seem to avoid negative consequences (Douglas, 1987).  Douglas (1990) expanded this verbal communication to uncertainty relationship by discovering that question-asking resulted in uncertainty reduction which in turn resulted in increased levels of disclosure.		
: Douglas (1991) defines global uncertainty as “uncertainty about acquaintanceship in general” (p. 356).  In this article, Douglas found that individuals with high global uncertainty are less likely to engage in question-asking, self-disclosure, and are evaluated as less competent communicators than individuals with low global uncertainty.  Findings also suggested that high global uncertainty positively correlates to communication apprehension.  This has a negative effect on relational development and can result in low levels of relational satisfaction.		

; Uncertainty-Increasing Events : Sally Planalp and James Honeycutt (1985) also made substantial contributions to uncertainty reduction research.  Planalp and Honeycutt recognized that communication does not always function as an uncertainty reducing agent, but can also serve to increase uncertainty when information conflicts with past knowledge.  The authors researched what specific events lead to increased uncertainty in interpersonal relationships and their effects on both the individual and the relationship.  The results found that uncertainty-increasing events were very likely to result in relational dissolution or decreased closeness of the relational partners.  This research was very beneficial because it led to better explanations regarding the role of communication in uncertainty reduction. 

; Romantic Relationships : Malcolm Parks and Mara Adelman (1983) sought to expand the breadth of URT to apply to romantic relationships.  Data was collected from individuals in premarital romantic relationships through questionnaires and telephone interviews.  Individuals who communicated more often with their romantic partner and their partner’s network (family and friends) perceived greater similarity to their partner.  They also received greater support from their own network (family and friends), and experienced a lower degree of uncertainty (Parks &amp; Adelman, 1983).  These findings support URT’s axioms that greater verbal communication and similarity serve to decrease uncertainty (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975), and also extends the scope of URT to romantic relationships.

; Relational Maintenance : In recent years, studies have begun to link uncertainty reduction to relational maintenance processes.  Dainton and Aylor (2001) connected relational uncertainty positively to jealousy and negatively to relational maintenance behaviors.  These results suggested that individuals are less likely to engage in relational maintenance when high uncertainty exists in the relationship. 
 
; Cultural Studies : Research conducted by William Gudykunst and Tsukasa Nishida (1984) expanded URT’s scope to intercultural contexts.  Specifically the researchers examined the effects of attitude similarity, cultural similarity, culture, and self-monitoring on attraction, intent to interrogate, intent to self-disclose, attributional confidence, and intent to display nonverbal affiliative behaviors (Gudykunst &amp; Nishida, 1984).   Research conducted on individuals of the Japanese and American cultures found a positive correlation between each of the variables indicating that uncertainty varies across cultures.

==== C. Criticisms of URT ====

Berger (1987) recognized that URT “contains some propositions of dubious validity” (p. 40).  Like many other successful theoretical approaches, Berger and Calabrese’s (1975) theory of uncertainty reduction has inspired subsequent research that served both as supporting evidence and in an oppositional role to the theory.  These criticisms help to clarify the underlying principles of the theory and suggest ways for improvement for future research.

Michael Sunnafrank (1986) argued that a motivation to reduce uncertainty is not a primary concern in initial interactions.  His belief was that a “maximization of relational outcomes” (p. 9) was of more significant concern in initial encounters.  Sunnafrank argued that the predicted outcome value (POV) of the interaction had a greater effect on uncertainty.  Berger (1986) combated Sunnafrank’s arguments by acknowledging that outcomes cannot be predicted if there is no previous history of interaction regarding the behavior of the individuals.  Berger claims that Sunnafrank’s arguments simply expanded URT: that by predicting outcomes (using POV) individuals are actually reducing their uncertainty (Berger, 1986). 

Kathy Kellermann and Rodney Reynolds (1990) also tested the validity of URT.  Their primary concern was axiom three, which related high uncertainty to high information seeking (see appendix A).  Their study of over a thousand students found that a want for knowledge was a greater indicator than a lack of knowledge for promotion of information-seeking (Kellermann &amp; Reynolds, 1990).  These researchers emphasized that high uncertainty does not create enough motivation to result in information-seeking; rather a want for information must also exist.  

Canary and Dainton (2003) explored uncertainty reduction in terms of relational maintenance across cultural contexts and found that the applicability of URT may not hold to multiple cultures.  Canary and Dainton (2003) focused on the concept of uncertainty avoidance in cultures stating: “individuals from cultures with a high tolerance for uncertainty are unlikely to find the experience of uncertainty as a primary motivator for performing relational maintenance” (p. 314).  This leads to a general questioning of validity of URT other cultures.

== Legacy and Influence ==

Research has found that communication plays a critical role in initial interactions and relational development.  Berger and Calabrese (1975) were the first to investigate the role of communication in initial interactions with the development of a theory of uncertainty reduction.  Its widespread influence led to its adoption in other relational and communicative contexts such as small group, mass communication, and computer-mediated communication. 

The influence of URT is well noted by others in the field: “Postulates by Berger and Calabrese prompted more than two decades of research to prove, clarify, and critique uncertainty reduction’s explanation of how people communicate interpersonally” (Heath &amp; Bryant, 2000, p. 275).  Berger and Calabrese (1975) generated additional studies on uncertainty reduction accomplished by such scholars as Hewes, Planalp, Parks, Adelman, Gudykunst, Yang, Nishida, Douglas, Kellerman, Hammer, Rutherford, Honeycutt, Sunnafrank, Capella, Werner, and Baxter.  URT has withstood the test of time, proving itself as a heuristic theory with utility that increases with subsequent research.

== Appendix A: Axioms and Theorems of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ==

=== Axioms of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ===

# Given the high level of uncertainty present at the onset of the entry phase, as the amount of verbal communication between strangers increases, the level of uncertainty for each interactant in the relationship will decrease. As uncertainty is further reduced, the amount of verbal communication will increase.
# As nonverbal affiliative expressiveness increases, uncertainty levels will decrease in an initial interaction situation. In addition, decreases in uncertainty level will cause increases in nonverbal affiliative expressiveness. 
# High levels of uncertainty cause increases in information seeking behavior. As uncertainty levels decline, information seeking behavior decreases. 
# High levels of uncertainty in a relationship cause decreases in the intimacy level of communication content. Low levels of uncertainty produce high levels of intimacy. 
# High levels of uncertainty produce high rates of reciprocity. Low levels of uncertainty produce low reciprocity rates. 
# Similarities between persons reduce uncertainty, while dissimilarities produce increases in uncertainty.
# Increases in uncertainty level produce decreases in liking; decreases in uncertainty level produce increases in liking.

=== Theorems of Uncertainty Reduction Theory ===

# Amount of verbal communication and nonverbal affiliative expressiveness are positively related.
# Amount of communication and intimacy level of communication are positively related.

In the 3rd chapter on &quot;uncertainty reduction&quot; 2nd's paragraph you mention an author Health. The author's name is not Health but Heath.

each section will follow how i am currently being taught. i will draw diagrams in gimp and upload them. i will steal from wherever is nessisary (gpl'ed texts), and include problem sets along with solutions.
as this is materials science, i would advocate different levels of material, levels 1-5 with increasing difficulty. --[[User:Mfadock|Mfadock]] 20:00, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Snowhare. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Snowhare~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Materials science is the study of the structural and functional properties of materials. It focuses on the factors inherent within materials that influence their properties. These factors include composition, the structure of the matter within the material and the type and quantity of defects that are present. It is a multidisciplinary subject that draws upon and feeds back to the learning in just about every field of science and engineering in some way or another placing the subject in a central role to many of the activities in these related subjects.

This book is aimed at those studying materials science at the undergraduate level in university whether as their major field or as a single module of a related engineering course.

In the previous chapter we learned what digital information is. Digital information is represented as bits, which can take on values of either 1 or 0. In this chapter we begin to explore how to perform calculations and do other work using digital information.

Much of what we will be discussing was formalized by [[:w:George Boole|George Boole]] (1815–1864) in his paper ''An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities'', published in 1854. It had few applications at the time, but eventually scientists and engineers realized that his system could be used to create efficient computer logic. The branch of mathematics involving digital logic is aptly named Boolean Algebra.

== Basic Operators ==

Digital logic has three basic operators, the AND, the OR and the NOT. These three operators form the basis for everything in digital logic. In fact, almost everything your computer does can be described in terms of these three operations. Fortunately, these operations are not difficult to understand, as their meanings resemble the meanings of the words as used in every day language.

=== AND ===

The symbol for the AND operation is a single dot. A mathematical expression using AND looks like this.

&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

The value of an AND expression is 1 only if both input values are 1. Otherwise, the value is 0. That is, the above expression equals 1 if and only if A '''and''' B are 1. The AND operation can be described with the following truth table.

{{Truthtable2|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;|0|0|0|1}}

=== OR ===

The symbol for the OR operation is a plus sign. A mathematical expression using OR looks like this.

&lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt;

The value of an OR expression is 1 when at least of of the input values is 1, and 0 otherwise. That is, the above expression equals 1 if either A '''or''' B is 1. The truth table for the OR operation is as follows.

{{Truthtable2|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt;|0|1|1|1}}

=== NOT ===

NOT is the simplest operation. AND and OR are binary operations, since they require two values as input. NOT is a unary operation, and looks like this.

&lt;math&gt;\overline{A}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of a NOT expression is the opposite value of the input value.

{{Truthtable1|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;|&lt;math&gt;\overline{A}&lt;/math&gt;|1|0}}

==NAND and NOR==

If the AND, OR and NOT operators are combined, then the NOR and NAND can be created:
*A NAND B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{A \cdot B}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the inverted output of the AND gate.
*A NOR B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;. This is just the inverted output of an OR gate.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center
! NAND !! NOR
|-
|&lt;math&gt;Q=\overline{X \cdot Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;Q=\overline{X + Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|1|1|1|0}}
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|1|0|0|0}}
|}

==XOR and XNOR==

Two other important gates are the exclusive-OR and exclusive -NOR operators, XOR and XNOR. This is sometimes denoted by a plus sign in a circle.
*A XOR B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{A} \cdot B + A \overline{B} = A \oplus B &lt;/math&gt;. This is true only if exactly one of the inputs is one.
*A XNOR B is &lt;math&gt;\overline{\overline{A} \cdot B + A \overline{B}} = \overline{A \oplus B}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the inverted output of an XOR gate: it is only true if both input are the same.

{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center
! XOR !! XNOR
|-
|&lt;math&gt;Q={X \oplus Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;Q=\overline{X \oplus Y}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|0|1|1|0}}
|{{Truthtable2|X|Y|Q|1|0|0|1}}
|}

XOR represents a modulo-2 addition, which means that if you add 1 to 1, you wrap around back to 0. This is very useful function in digital electronics, but it is not an important concept in Boolean algebra.

==Formal Mathematical Operators==

In the field of logic, which is part of discrete mathematics, there is an alternative notation to the addition/multiplication type we have seen:

*AND is represented by &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; Therefore &lt;tt&gt;A AND B&lt;tt&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;.
*OR is represented by &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; Therefore &lt;tt&gt;A OR B&lt;tt&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;.
*NOT is represented by &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;tt&gt;NOT A&lt;tt&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt;.

Unfortunately, computer science, engineering and mathematics seem unable to establish a consensus, so we are stuck with both forms of notation.  Other books, and especially those that deal more with pure logic or discrete mathematics may have various notations, so if other books are consulted, then the other notation needs to be known. As this is an engineering book, we will not use this notation.

==Boolean Algebra Laws==

Boolean Algebra, like regular algebra, has certain rules. These rules are Associativity, Distributivity, Commutativity and De Morgan's Laws. Associativity, Commutativity and Distributivity only apply to the AND and OR operators. Some of these laws may seem trivial because you are so used to them. However, when Boolean algebra was created with its different rules, every axiom we take for granted in &quot;normal&quot; algebra no longer was guaranteed to apply. These laws have been proved to hold under Boolean algebra.

====Associativity====
{{Wikipedia|Associativity}}
Associativity is the property of algebra that the order of evaluation of the terms is immaterial.

:&lt;math&gt;A+(B+C) \iff (A+B)+C \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot(B \cdot C) \iff (A\cdot B) \cdot C \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Distributivity====
{{Wikipedia|Distributivity}}
Distibutivity is the property that an operator can be applied to each of the terms within the brackets.

:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot (B+C) \iff (A \cdot B)+(A \cdot C) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A+(B \cdot C ) \iff (A+B) \cdot (A + C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Commutativity====
{{Wikipedia|Commutativity}}
Commutativity is the property that order of application of an operator is immaterial.
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot B \iff B \cdot A \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A+B \iff B+A \,&lt;/math&gt;

====De Morgan's Law====
{{Wikipedia|De Morgan's Law}}
De Morgan's Law is a consequence of the fact that the NOT or negation operator is not distributive.

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P \cdot Q} \iff \overline {P}+ \overline {Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P+Q} \iff \overline {P} \cdot \overline {Q}&lt;/math&gt;

De Morgan's laws (named after [[:w:Augustus De Morgan|Augustus De Morgan]], 1806–1871) tell us: a NAND gate gives the same output as an OR gate with inputs complemented; a NOR gate gives the same output as an AND gate with inputs complemented. These complemented-input gates are also known as bubbled gates because of the way that they are indicated on a symbol, i.e., by including a small 'bubble' on each input, in the same fashion that circles are drawn on the outputs of the NOT, NAND and NOR gates.

[[image:DeMorganGates.GIF]]

[[image:baops.gif]]

De Morgan's laws are the most useful while simplifying a boolean expression. An easy way to remember these laws is &quot;Change the sign, break the line&quot;.

{{Digital Circuits/Exercise

|By constructing the appropriate truth tables, verify the laws of:
#Associativity of the AND operator,
#Ditributivity of the OR operator,
#Commutativity of the OR operatar,
#De Morgan's Law for the NAND operator.
| 
#We see that the truth tables for

}}

===Operator precedence===
It is important to note that
:&lt;math&gt;A.B+C \ne A.(B+C)&lt;/math&gt;
This can be seen as either AND having a higher precedence or the fact that associativity does not hold between AND and OR or that it is an invalid application of distributivity.

Another way of looking at this is the application of our understanding of normal algebra, where the analogy between OR being addition and AND being multiplication is made.  We would never make this error if this were normal algebra with numbers rather than Boolean entities.

===Other Rules===

All of these laws result in a number of rules that apply to all Boolean expressions. These laws have names, but it is only important that you are able to apply them where needed! Note that many rules have two forms - this called duality, and we will discuss it later.

|-

|-
| 5a ||rowspan = 2 | Absorption ||&lt;math&gt;A+(A \cdot B) = A \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| 5b || &lt;math&gt;A \cdot (A + B) = A \,&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| 6  || Involution or Double Negation ||&lt;math&gt;\overline{\overline{\,A}}=A&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 7a || rowspan = 2 | Consensus Theorem ||&lt;math&gt;A\cdot B+\overline{A}\cdot C + B\cdot C = A\cdot B + \overline{A}\cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 7b || &lt;math&gt;(A+B)\cdot (\overline{A}+C) \cdot (B+C) = (A+B)\cdot (\overline{A}+C)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Principle of Duality===
The principle of duality tells us: If, in a boolean equation, we interchange the AND and OR operators and interchange '0' with '1' then the resultant boolean equation is also true.

;Example 1:
:If we are aware that &lt;tt&gt;A.(B+C)=(A.B)+(A.C)&lt;/tt&gt; (law of distributivity of the AND operator) then by the principle of duality, we can say that &lt;tt&gt;A+(B.C)=(A+B).(A+C)&lt;/tt&gt; (law of distributivity of the OR operator).

;Example 2:
:Consider the identity law for the OR operator: &lt;tt&gt;A+0=A &lt;/tt&gt;. Applying duality, we get the identity law for the AND operator: &lt;tt&gt;A·1=A&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Boolean Simplification==

It is often the case that you want to simplify a given Boolean function. For example, you might want to reduce the number of logic gates required to implement that particular function. Simplification is done by repeated application of the rules and laws of Boolean algebra. Bear in mind that you sometimes have to apply them backwards to get the minimal form. NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR all need to be expanded to just AND, OR and NOT in order for simplification to work.

[[Digital Circuits/Karnaugh Maps|Karnaugh Maps]] are a more formal way of doing this for the guaranteed smallest form, but we will do it by hand for now.

===Examples===

Simplify the following expressions.
#&lt;math&gt;B.A. \overline {A}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A. \overline {B} + A.B&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 1====

Using rule 4b, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;B \cdot 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This is directly rule 5, so &lt;math&gt;B.A. \bar {A} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====

Using distributivity, we can take A out of the brackets, giving 
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot (\overline{B} + B)&lt;/math&gt;

Using rule 4a, we see that:
:&lt;math&gt;A \cdot 1 = A&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore see that &lt;math&gt;A. \overline {B} + A.B = A&lt;/math&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cnelson. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cnelson~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Subjunctive ^_^ ==

It's actually quite simple.

The present tense through future tenses use the present stem. I'm using the word amo, amare, amavi, amatus - to love, so the present stem is &quot;am&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Present:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amo'''r'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              1st person (pl): ama'''mur'''   &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: ama'''ris'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            2nd person (pl): ama'''mini'''   &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: ama'''tur'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): ama'''ntur'''  &lt;br /&gt;

Imperfect:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amaba'''r'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              1st person (pl): amaba'''mur'''   &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amaba'''ris'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            2nd person (pl): amaba'''mini'''   &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amaba'''tur'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): amaba'''ntur'''  &lt;br /&gt;

Future:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amabo'''r'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;              1st person (pl): amabi'''mur'''   &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amabe'''ris'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            2nd person (pl): amabi'''mini'''   &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amabi'''tur'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): amabu'''ntur'''  &lt;br /&gt;

For the perfect verbs, use the fourth principle part. Then, add the correct form of &quot;to be&quot;. For perfect, you use the present to-be verb (sum, es, est...). For pluperfect, you use the imperfect (eram, eras, erat...) and for future perfect, you use the future tense. (ero, eris, erit)We're continuing with amo. Don't forget to make the usual &quot;us&quot; ending of your verb into an &quot;i&quot; when you're doing plurals.&lt;br /&gt;

Perfect:&lt;br /&gt;
1st person: amatus sum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;           1st person (pl): amati sumus  &lt;br /&gt;
2nd person: amatus es&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;             2nd person (pl): amati estis &lt;br /&gt;
3rd person: amatus est&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;            3rd person (pl): amati sunt&lt;br /&gt;

Pluperfect:&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">VB.NET supports a number of data structures called Collections. Collection can be either zero or one based, depending on how they are declared. A collection is similar to an array in that it can store multiple data entries. However, most collections have advanced methods associated with them that distinguish them from [[../Arrays|Arrays]]. Some of these collections are:

== ArrayList ==
An ArrayList is a dynamic array, the size increases and shrinks when needed and stores elements as generic Object's, this provides us with the ability to store objects with differing types.

=== Add method ===
To add objects to the ArrayList use the System.Collections.ArrayList.Add(Object) method
The following is an example of adding String objects to an Arraylist.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
   Module Module1
   Sub Main()

       Dim MyArrayList As System.Collections.ArrayList = New ArrayList()
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;a&quot;))
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;b&quot;))
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;c&quot;))
       MyArrayList.add(New String(&quot;d&quot;))
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press enter to continue&quot;)
       Console.ReadLine()

   End Sub
   End Module
&lt;/source&gt;

== Queue ==
A queue is a [[w:FIFO|first-in/first-out]] style collection. A queue has two unique methods used to enqueue and dequeue information from it. Using the System.Collections.Queue.Enqueue method, an object can be added to the end of the collection. Items can later be removed using the System.Collections.Queue.Dequeue method. This method will take the first object in the queue collection and then remove it from that collection.

== Stack ==
[[Image:Programming-stack.png|float|right]]
A stack is a [[w:LIFO (computing)|last-in/first-out]] style collection. A stack has three unique methods used to store and retrieve information from it. Using the System.Collections.Stack.Push method, an object can be added to the top of the stack, pushing the objects below it lower into the stack. Items can later be removed from the stack using the System.Collections.Stack.Pop method. This method will return the object at the top of the stack and remove it from the stack. Another method, System.Collections.Stack.Peek, is similar to the Pop method except it returns the object ''without'' removing it from the stack.

== SortedList ==
A SortedList collection is a collection of objects that are sorted both by index (similar to an array) and by key. A key works in a manner similar to that of an index; however, unlike an index, a key can be any object.

== Generics ==
Generics provide data structures that work for a variety of data types.  While the collections discussed above store items as objects, generic collections store the values in a more specific type such as String or Integer.
===List===
A List(Of Type) allows a set of values to be accessed by index or as a collection. You can therefore mix array and collection syntax on the same set:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
       Dim Weekdays As New List(Of String)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Monday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Tuesday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Wednesday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Thursday&quot;)
       Weekdays.Add(&quot;Friday&quot;)
       
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Accessing members by index...&quot;)
       For i As Integer = Weekdays.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1
           Console.WriteLine(Weekdays(i))
       Next i
       Console.WriteLine(&quot;Accessing members as a collection...&quot;)
       For Each s As String In Weekdays
           Console.WriteLine(s)
       Next s
&lt;/source&gt;

----

Niki, the robot, lives on a chessboard with 8 by 8 squares. At any time Niki has a defined orientation looking either west (&lt;), north (^), east (&gt;) or south (v) and uniquely lives on one of the squares. Niki can be programmed by a sequence of the following commands:

----
&lt;pre&gt;
move'n'pick
&lt;/pre&gt;
Moves one square in the current direction and picks up an item, if present. Items are denoted with '*' on the board.

&lt;pre&gt;
turn right
&lt;/pre&gt;
Changes the direction of niki clockwise.

&lt;pre&gt;
goto LABEL if wall
&lt;/pre&gt;
LABEL can designate the position of any of the commands listed before this one in the program, i.e. the branch can only be upwards in the program. The command branches there if right ahead of Niki there is a wall, which means the border of the board or a wall between squares denoted with 'W'. Otherwise the next command is being executed.
----

If Niki moves and a wall is ahead, nothing happens.

=== Problem 1 ===

Niki looks east.

I suggest merging this into [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]], where I am already contributing. It already has some Linux-specific commands (lsmod, modprobe) and at least one builtin command (cd). One idea might be to move this page to Guide to UNIX/Commands/Index, then wait for contributors to link commands to their descriptions. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:44, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== Man to wiki ==

Since the man pages for the gnu commands are also GPL, is it reasonable to have a bot creating wiki pages from man pages? --[[User:Sbenza|SamSam]] 20:43, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:Most of the GNU &quot;man&quot; manuals (like [http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?manpath=linux&amp;query=ls ls]) refer you to the &quot;info&quot; manuals (like [http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html coreutils]). By the texinfo source of the coreutils manual, I read, ''Permission is granted to copy, distribute, and/or modify this document under the terms of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]... with no Invariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover Texts.'' This statement seems compatible with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]].

:At one point I considered taking text from the coreutils manual to fill in missing commands for [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]]. I decided against this. Instead, I am planning to make links to the coreutils manual on GNU's web site, the various *BSD manual pages, and the [[lqwiki:|Linux Questions wiki]].

:However, you, or other contributors, might take text from GNU manuals. In this case, the [[GFDL]] section 4 item I seems to require the creation of a &quot;History&quot; section describing how the GNU version and then the modified Wikibooks version was made. (If you, or other contributors, do not want to modify the GNU manual text, but want it in wiki format, then [[wikisource:|Wikisource]] might be a better place.)

:However, many GNU manuals contain Invariant Sections or Cover Texts. In these cases, they seem to be incompatible with [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]], and cannot be used on Wikibooks. This includes the gcc and emacs manuals. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:00, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

==Aditional command and enchement proposal==
===commands===
i'm unshure that they belongs to coreutils but i've founded on all my systems(gentoo,qtopia embedd,knoppix)

-wget (downloader)

-losetup(link a file to a dev in order to mount loop files (ex:/knoppix.img to /dev/loop/0))

-md5sum

==enchement proposal==
why not making a command line tutorial with the folowing things:
the | that is a pipe
the &gt; that write the data to a file
etc...
and a link to a bash script programing guide at the end of this book
and use this guide as in introduction for the bash script programing guide</text>

* How can you have one third plus two thirds PLUS four percent of the population ?!? A population of 104% it's too much, isn't?

1/3 and 2/3 are understood as approximate. It's not like it's a big deal. &quot;every year 21 babies are born&quot; was a big deal until I figured out that was for every 1000 population, which was not obvious from the way it was phrased. A much, much bigger deal was the 81% of the population works, which is just dumb. That's simply not the way employment statistics works. Just because there's 18% unemployment doesn't mean there's 81% employment, let alone that 81% ''of the population'' works.

And this is to say nothing of the white supremacist racism which I've ripped out of there pronto. Or the revisionist &quot;Hugo Chavez is responsible for the actions of his enemies&quot; which just makes me want to puke. [[User:70.26.56.242|70.26.56.242]] 20:51, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may've read or heard people say that your '''weight''' would be different on the Moon, or on other planets and their moons. Does this mean that when you leave the Earth you somehow become fatter or thinner, without gorging on food or going on a diet? &amp;nbsp;Hopefully you'll be glad to hear the answer is no! &amp;nbsp;Here's why:

=== Gravity ===
Have you ever wondered why everything on the Earth doesn't just float up into the sky and off into space? &amp;nbsp;Or perhaps why you land back on the ground whenever you jump up?

So far as we know, everything in the Universe tries to pull on everything else. This pull is what's known as '''gravity'''. It's actually very weak, but the more bulky things are and the nearer they are to each other, the stronger the pull becomes. The more bulky something is, the more it pulls on other things around it.

Compared to [each of us], the Earth is very bulky, so its pull on [each one of us] is very strong. That's why we don't all float away from the Earth – and why, whenever we jump up, we're pulled back down to the ground. We each pull on the Earth, just as it pulls on [each of us]. [Each of us] is tiny compared to the Earth, though, so our pull on the Earth is tiny too.

Other places in our Solar System [– and in the rest of the Universe –] are much more bulky than the Earth, while others are much less bulky than the Earth, so

{''Still too complicated / sentences too long:''} Other places in our Solar System and the rest of the universe are more or less bulky than the Earth, so their gravity is more or less than that here on Earth. So, if we leave the Earth and visit them, their pull on us will be more or less than that we know here on Earth. The Moon, for example, is &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; bulky than the Earth. If you weighed yourself there with a bathroom scale, it would say you weighed &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than when you weighed yourself with it on the Earth. This is why people say your weight is different at different places in the Solar System or the rest of the universe! &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; haven't changed &amp;ndash; what's changed is the strength of the gravity keeping you on the surface of whatever place you're visiting.
----
{''Mention planet and comet formation?''} {''Perhaps even some simple(!) imagery to suggest curved space (without using that phrase) in place of &quot;pull/ing&quot;?''}
----

=== Orbits and weightlessness ===

You don't even have to travel that far from the Earth to experience this change. If you travel fast enough around it, the Earth's surface will keep curving away from you as fast as Earth's gravity pulls you toward it. You'll keep going round and round the Earth, never getting any closer to it. This is called orbiting the Earth and the path you follow around the Earth is called an '''orbit'''. Since you don't get any closer to the Earth, it's as if the Earth is no longer pulling on you and so you have no weight &amp;mdash; you're '''weightless'''.

The same is true if you travel fast enough around anything else in the universe. The speed you'll need depends on how bulky it is and how far away you are from it.

mass in science does not mean weight! weight is mass times acceleration due to gravity. or in formula form w=9.8m/s₂*m
so to figure weight all you do is the mass of an object times 9.8m/s₂ 

Alexa J. an8th grader


I happened by this module and was astonished by its opening sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This is a myth-busting section to help you avoid getting confused about what it means to talk about your ''mass, or the more commonly used term for this, weight'', on another planet.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If this module is meant to be &quot;myth-busting&quot;, it surely must not start with something that can read as ''confirming'' the very misunderstanding it is setting out to undo, viz that 'mass' and 'weight' are interchangeable terms and concepts! (see italics)

I read further and was dismayed to see that the article fell into this trap by the third paragraph of the 'What are mass and gravity?&quot; section. Note the shift from referring to mass to referring to weight (underlined):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;People used to think that that if you dropped a &lt;u&gt;massive&lt;/u&gt; object (like a canon ball) from a height that it would fall to Earth more quickly than a &lt;u&gt;li&lt;/u&gt;g&lt;u&gt;hter&lt;/u&gt; object (such as a ball bearing)...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, as mentioned in the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#Leaning Tower of Pisa|Leaning Tower of Pisa]] thread above, the Leaning Tower of Pisa story is unsubstantiated (and most likely apocryphal).

Wishing to remove these errors and clarify the material, I've tried rewriting the opening two sections. I hope I have kept them sufficiently straightforward and that people find my contribution helpful. I plan to review the remaining sections soon.

I think this Wikijunior book could be great and I look forward to sharing it with my niece in the not-too-distant future.

Best wishes,&lt;/br&gt;

:Did you actually read any of the authorities cited above, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]]?  Obviously not.

:What you need to distinguish is mass and force.  ''Weight'' is an ambiguous word; it can be either mass (in its physics jargon meaning, not, for example, what a bodybuilder refers to in discussing muscle mass, and not a church service either) or certain particular kinds of force (but not forces such as the thrust of a rocket or the tension due to a spring or rubber band).

:Of course, that isn't the only word which has more than one meaning.  Kids age 8-11 may well know the word &quot;massive&quot;, but they're likely to know it in the meanings related to occupying a large volume, or a large part of their field of view, not in the technical jargon meaning common in college physics.  You'd have a hard time convincing them at this stage that an ant, or a bacterium,  is &quot;massive&quot;&amp;mdash;and most of their parents will also think you are off your rocker if you make that claim.

Thank you for your prompt response.

I have read the authorities cited above. I am trying to keep in mind, however, that this module is in a science-based book meant for young people. It is an opportunity to introduce (or confirm) the distinction science makes between mass and weight, before the ambiguous or metaphorical uses of these terms in common parlance and literature instil any confusion. I have reviewed the module's opening statement and hope it satisifies your point.

I note your mention of force above and inclusion at the end of [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] ¶2. Force is a concept that is also prone to variable use and meaning outside science. Since I believe it is possible to write the module's opening sections without referring to it directly, I chose to do so in order to keep the content as straightforward as possible. I have simply adopted the use of &quot;pull&quot; that was already in place before I edited [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] ¶2. The same applies as regards avoiding the term &quot;inertia&quot; or the verb &quot;accelerate&quot;.

I also use &quot;move&quot; rather than &quot;speed up&quot; (or &quot;accelerate&quot;) as I can imagine a young person thinking that in order for something to speed up it must already be moving.

I agree that my use of &quot;massive&quot; is probably too adult; thank you for pointing this out. I also remembered that it has that rap/hip-hop slang sense of &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;a gang or collective&quot;. Rest assured that I don't see myself trying to convince anyone that an ant or bacterium is &quot;massive&quot;.

On re-reading the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] section, I was unconvinced by the &quot;There is always a balance between...&quot; sentence. I've now amended it, but am still not wholly convinced. What's being implied is the proportionality between forces and masses, but &quot;proportionality&quot; is a long word and another concept...

:You don't seem to understand that it isn't the normal usage, the usage those children are going to be most familiar with, which &quot;instills confusion&quot;.  That normal usage is quite legitimate and proper, well justified in history, in linguistics, and in the law.

:Speaking of confusion, there wouldn't be any chance that you yourself would be so confused as to think that when my ketchup bottle has a &quot;net weight&quot; of &quot;24 oz (1 lb 8 oz) 680 g&quot;, that any of those units either '''are''' or '''should be''' units of force, are you?  Or that a gold bar with a &quot;troy weight&quot; of 402.09 oz would have a ''different'' weight in Hammerfest, Norway than it would in Quito, Ecuador? The troy ounce is a &quot;unit of weight&quot; isn't it, as almost any dictionary will tell you?  But there is not, and never has been a troy ounce force.  It isn't is any different, of course, if that gold bar's weight is expressed as 12.5064 kg as is stamped on the top one in the pile shown here.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gold_ingots.jpg]  Gold buyers and sellers wouldn't be silly enough to weigh their gold in newtons, or in pounds-force.

:Because if you don't understand those basic facts, then you are the one likely to instill confusion.  You can make the point that in the sciences the sciences, the word &quot;weight&quot; is often limited to a different meaning than what these children are most accustomed to, and that they as well as grownups often use various meanings of the word without having the distinctions clear in their own minds.  But just remember, we are fortunate that nobody ever gave any high school chemistry teacher or college physics professor any say-so as to what the word ''weight'' means when we buy and sell salt or gold or platinum or diamonds (''carat weight'', where one carat is exactly 1/5 gram) or anything else.  Nor in the medical sciences, when the doctor or nurse measures our body weight, and uses it to calculate our BMI.

:Furthermore, those who use it that way own this word; they have the prior claim to it, by a long shot.  They've been using this English word that way for over a thousand years, back into the &quot;Old English&quot; days.  It is the newer, spinoff variant that &quot;instills confusion&quot;; a meaning that only showed up on the scene about 275 years ago.

:The use of the term ''weight'' is much more uniform and consistent and correct within commerce in general than it is in science in general.  That Canadian standard above got it right, using &quot;nearly always&quot; in describing the former context, and the weaker terminology &quot;primarily&quot; in connection with science and technology.

:Consider, for example, that agricultural scientists in the U.S. and Canada (yes, today) often use &quot;bushels by weight&quot; in publishing the yields of different varieties on their test plots, and measure the quality of various grains and legumes and oilseeds using a &quot;1,000 kernel weight&quot; in grams.  Biologists and paleontologists measure the ''body weight'' of animals in the same way that medical doctors do, using the same units (in metric units, they use the proper SI units:  '''always''' grams or kilograms (occasionally metric tons), never kilonewtons and the like).

:I'll leave it to you to check out things like &quot;atomic weight&quot;, &quot;formula weight&quot;, &quot;gram-equivalent weight&quot;, and the like. And abbbreviations such as &quot;at. wt.&quot;, common on many of the zillions of Periodic Tables of the Elements found on the internet, many on the sites of colleges and universities around the world.

:It isn't your car mechanic, or your hairdresser, or a long-haul truck driver, or the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker, who are going to use terms such as &quot;molecular weight&quot; and &quot;atomic weight&quot; in connection with their work.  They are only used in connection with the sciences such as chemistry and physics.

:NASA, of course, tells us that the &quot;weight&quot; of the Apollo 11 lunar module, at liftoff of its ascent stage, was 10,776.6 pounds. (See NASA's [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-37_Selected_Mission_Weights.htm Selected Mission Weights] page; other sources will tell you that this liftoff was accomplished with a thrust of about 3,500 pounds-force, which may help you understand the meaning NASA uses here.)  You can find lots of other use of weight with the same meaning as ''mass'' has in physics jargon among rocket scientists and engineers.

:On to other things:  It takes no force to &quot;move&quot; something, or more precisely, to keep it moving. That is an all-too-common misconception; we don't need to reinforce that incorrect idea in the minds of these children. The force is needed only to accelerate it, or to overcome some other force that is accelerating it in a different direction from the direction in which it is moving, such as friction (but we are ignoring air resistance in the examples, so that doesn't apply). 

:Force isn't the word you need to avoid; much better to avoid the ambiguous word &quot;weight&quot;.  Of the various meanings of force, there is usually only one of them which we measure and assign a numerical value; there isn't any real difficulty in either using that word or making it clear what we mean by it.

Thank you for your latest thoughts.

I appreciate your concern that a (young) reader is likely to have had the notions of mass and weight conflated through everyday use and so may be unsettled to read that, as regards science, they are distinct attributes. In view of this I have therefore amended the opening paragraph.

No, I don't think the weight of a ketchup bottle or the other objects you mention need be described in units of force, as usually they exist in the same relatively strong (and near-uniform) gravitational field. If they are taken from the Earth to another body in the universe, however, they may once again exist in a relatively strong gravitational field, but it won't be the same strength as that of the Earth. Hence their weight - which still need not be measured in units of force - will not be the same as before. This module is in a book about our solar system, about bodies with gravitational fields whose strengths differ from that of the Earth, so surely the distinction between mass and weight is pertinent?

I agree that my phrasing &quot;takes more/less effort to move&quot; in [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#What are mass and gravity?|What are mass and gravity?]] ¶4 might be read as implying that, friction aside, force is constantly required to keep something moving. Thank you for pointing this out. I hope my amendments suffice.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 02:44, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:Conflated?  That isn't exactly the proper description of what happens.
:There are indeed two &quot;distinct attributes&quot; involved here.
:But a &quot;difference&quot; between weight and mass isn't something that '''just exists'''.  It needs to be created; there is no God-given meaning assigned to our ''words''.
:The questions here are matters of history and of the law.  The science involved here is '''semantics''', a branch of the science of '''linguistics''', not astronomy (and also not chemistry, not physics).
:That &quot;difference&quot; can, of course, be created, within the limited jargon usage of a particular book, even a particular classroom, and to a lesser extent within some broader field of activity.  That doesn't mean that the difference exists outside that context, however.
:Beyond that, what is it that you don't understand about millions of uses '''in science''' of the word ''weight'' with the very same meaning that ''mass'' usually has in physics jargon?   Is it just that you don't know what &quot;molecular weight&quot; means, that you don't know what the weight in grams of 1,000 kernels of wheat means, you don't know what an &quot;egg weight&quot; of 65 g ([[w:Welsumer]]) means, etc.?  You didn't address that point at all. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 14:56, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

Hello again.

I too believe &quot;there is no God-given meaning assigned to [] words&quot;. I appreciate that people come to use the words 'mass' and 'weight' interchangeably because almost all of us spend almost all our lives in the same, effectively constant circumstance: Earth's gravitational field. But the distinction between mass and weight becomes pertinent as soon as this circumstance can no longer be assumed - when, for example, other planets in our solar system are considered, as they are in this book.

I hope this clarifies how I addressed your point in my previous message (&quot;No, I don't think the weight of a ketchup bottle or the other objects you mention need be described in units of force, as usually they exist in the same relatively strong (and near-uniform) gravitational field.&quot;).

::BTW, thanks for making it abundantly clear that there are cases in which confusion has already been instilled in some people, with your confused ramblings about the ketchup bottle.  The strength of the gravitational field is totally irrelevant; 1 lb 8 oz of ketchup on Earth is still 1 lb 8 oz of ketchup on Mars, and 680 g of ketchup on Earth is still 680 g of ketchup on Mars.  That's just as it should be.  If that weight &quot;still need not be measured in units of force&quot; (as you said above), just how in the world are you imagining that that weight &quot;will not be the same as before&quot;?   In fact, it is actually stronger than &quot;need not&quot;; it is &quot;ought not&quot;.  It certainly wouldn't be pertinent to claim that the net weight of that bottle of ketchup would change, would it?  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 16:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

The mass of the ketchup would remain the same, but its weight would change. I believe this is meant to be the point of the module.

If I recall correctly, Mars' gravitational field is around a third that of the Earth, so a weight of 1 lb 8 oz of ketchup on Earth would become 8 oz on Mars and a weight of 680 g would become about 227 g.

What someone measures with scales is weight, even if (thanks to their Earth-bound circumstance) they also then equate that measurement with mass. One way to measure the mass of an object regardless of gravity is to multiply the object's volume by its density.

:You can certainly '''choose not to''' call this quantity of ketchup ''weight'', if you so desire.  But that is '''your only option.'''
:Note also that your making this choice will not affect the meaning of the word ''weight'' when someone else uses it in this context.  Nor will your making this choice give you any standing that they are making some kind of error in doing so.
:It is '''not a legitimate alternative''' for you to continue to call the quantity we measure in the sale of ketchup or gold or anything else by the name ''weight'', but to misapply a definition of this ambiguous word which is incorrect in that context.

:Most 10 years olds should already know enough to have great difficulty with your claim that 680 g on the Earth would be 227 g on Mars.  It is a little different with pounds--those Fred Flintstone units are like obsolete software, no longer fully supported and updated.  Like that old software, they will probably continue to work for your own use for some time, but if you eventually want to communicate with the rest of the world, they might fall short.  With the metric units, the keepers of our standards have been telling us for 45 years to stop using kilograms-force, and they are finally disappearing.  However, nobody is ever going to bother to tell us to stop using pounds-force without telling us to use pounds of any kind.  That doesn't really matter much to this discussion, however; we do not and never have used pounds-force in the sale of goods by weight.

:You also seem to have no understanding whatsoever of how balances work, and you appear totally clueless about the way in which the scales used in commerce are tested and certified for that use.  See, e.g., [[w:weighing scale]].
:There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that if you are accused of giving short weight, some government weights and measures official would mistakenly measure force instead of mass in determining whether legal charges should be brought against you. 
:Note also that while the law does define a pound as 0.45359237 kg exactly (see U.S. version above), it does not define a pound force.  Now ask yourself, &quot;Why in the world does the law bother to define a pound in the first place?&quot;  It is, of course, for the protectionof consumers, as a tool to help keep merchants honest.   The law quite properly defines the units we can legally use for that purpose (grams and kilograms and pounds and ounces in the United States, for example).

::I think our discussion hinges on what you, I and scientists make of the following scenario.

::We are on Earth and have an object, say a bottle of ketchup. We place it on one side of a balance - a comparator - and then see how many identical blocks need to be placed on the other side of the comparator to achieve equilibrium. Let's say it's five.

::We then take a spring and measure its length whilst unstretched; let's say it's nine units. We hang the bottle of ketchup from it and find the length of the spring is now (say) twelve units.

::We travel to Mars with the bottle of ketchup, the comparator, the blocks and the spring. On Mars we place the bottle of ketchup on one side of the comparator and find that the number of blocks needed on the other side to achieve an equilibrium is...? I - and I believe you and the scientists - would say five.

::We take the spring and - I hope you agree - find its length whilst unstretched is still nine units. We hang the bottle of ketchup from it and find the length of the spring is now...? Because Mars' gravitational field is about a third that of the Earth, I - and I believe scientists - would say &lt;i&gt;ten&lt;/i&gt; units, not twelve. What do you say?

::The comparator is measuring (more accurately, comparing) mass, whereas the spring is measuring weight. The mass remains constant between the Earth and Mars (and elsewhere). The weight changes. I believe this is significant in a book about celestial bodies, especially one to be read by young people.

:::The real question is, which of those measurements likely to meet the requirements of the law when it comes to selling ketchup (or gold or whatever) '''by weight'''.  We only need to look at what is actually done for measurements on the Earth today; there are significant variations in the strength of the gravitational field on Earth.  Even if you limit yourself to ''sea level'' on Earth, the variation is 0.53%, more than one part in 190, and there are variations with elevation wrt to sea level as well as with latitude.  It would certainly make a difference if force were measured rather than mass if you were buying or selling a 400 oz t bar of platinum, wouldn't it?  Or those 12½ kg gold bars I mentioned earlier, measured to the nearest 100 milligrams?  Your homework:  If that top gold bar weighs 12.5064 kg, how much force would it exert due to gravity at Hammerfest, Norway?  How much force would it exert due to gravity at Quito, Ecuador?  Any units of force you like, to however many significant digits (can't be more than six) you can get.

:::In fact, many spring scales have &quot;NOT LEGAL FOR TRADE&quot; or words of similar import right on their face.  A few spring scales are legal for trade, but they must be tested and certified before they can legally be used.  The same applies, of course, to any other kind of scale, including piezoelectric load cell devices or whatever.  Some of you probably remember those old Toledo Scale Company scales, with the motto &quot;HONEST WEIGHT:  NO SPRINGS&quot; boldly presented to the customer.

:::Do you have any idea whatsoever how that testing is done?
:::Rather than your &quot;blocks&quot;, a government inspector will come in with a few ''standard weights'' and test the scale in operation, in the very location in which it is used.  Maybe, for example, a 200 g weight and a 100 g weight, and they will see what the scale reads with one or the other or both of them, placed at varying locations on the weighing pan, see if it makes any difference if weights are being added or being taken away, things like that.
:::But what, exactly, is it that is known about those reference weights?  It isn't the amount of force that these weights exist.  They don't custom-make new weights which have a different mass, so that they can tell precisely how much force these weights exert at each particular location, and thus are useless outside that location.
:::Moreover, they wouldn't want to do that, even if they had some easy way of doing so.  We are interested in ''how much stuff we have,'' and we don't really care much about ''how hard it will press down on the table''.

:::You would, of course, also have to separate the weighing of the empty bottle, and the bottle including its contents, since we are interested in the ''net weight'' when we buy and sell goods by weight.

:::Now, let's check your understanding of history.  Let's suppose that somebody added a new word ''weyghte'' or (whatever spelling might have been used at the time, there was very little standardization in spelling then and what did exist was often slightly different from what we use now) to the English language some time over 1,000 years ago, using it to mean the quantity that they measured with one of those ''comparators'' you talked about.  So what, exactly, did this new word ''weyghte'' mean at the time, using everything we know now?

:::To put it another way, people have been weighing things for 7,00&amp;ndash;8,000 years or so, since long before the word weight entered the English language (that is, of course, the word we use today to refer to measurements made before the English word existed).  But nobody used any weighing devices that were not those mass-measuring balances, outside the past 200 years.

:::When the metric system was invented, nobody used weighing scales that were not mass-measuring balances.

:::Sir Isaac Newton never used weighing scales that were not mass-measuring balances.  Probably in part because of his day job as Master of the Mint, he liked to weigh things in troy ounces and troy grains (he often used French ''toises'' and ''pieds'' for length, however).  Of course, there is one way in which the troy units differ from their avoirdupois cousins, and differ from grams and kilograms as well&amp;mdash;there is not today and never was a troy ounce force.

:::Note that those '''comparators''', the mass-measuring type of scale we normally call a balance, were the only scales that existed at the time.  They couldn't have used anything else.  Spring scales didn't even show up in the picture until the '''Nineteenth Century''', and the various types of load cell devices are even newer than that.

:::Of course, thanks to the work of some 17th century pioneers, we are now able to distinguish between the ''mass'' of an object as that term is used in physics jargon, and the ''force that it exerts due to gravity''.  But after we humans got to be so all-fired smart three centuries ago, '''what exactly did we change about the quantity we measure when we buy and sell goods by weight?'''    '''Answer:  absolutely nothing.''' That is the most relevant point to be made here.  What exactly did we change about '''what we call this quantity?  Answer:  Nothing.'''  We still call it '''''weight''''', even if a few people are misguided enough to think that calling it '''''mass''''' instead is a sign of their intellectual superiority, and many more are even more misguided and have deluded themselves into believing that since it is in fact called ''weight'', it cannot possibly be the same thing as ''mass''.

Yes, as in an earlier reply, I acknowledge that people now, in history, in everyday life, in law, in literature and so on have and continue to use the words 'mass' and 'weight' without distinction. Since the seventeenth century, however, science has come to use these words to refer to distinct attributes. 'Mass' and 'weight' might have continued as synonyms in science - probably for weight, following the realisation that we're all living, measuring, buying, selling, writing and legislating in the same gravitational field - and a third word adopted, derived or invented to refer to amounts of matter, but this isn't what has happened. Science has come to use 'mass' to refer to amounts of matter and 'weight' to refer to the effect amounts of matter have in gravitational fields. That this has happened might not matter as regards all our everyday Earth-bound activities, but it does when thinking and writing about other celestial bodies, notions such as orbits and so on. Furthermore, drawing some attention to a distinction such as that science makes between mass and weight is a great opportunity to remind young people that new awareness can result from considering something otherwise taken as innocuous or for granted.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 01:43, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

:Of course we use them without distinction, in contexts where no distinction can be made.

:Why do you keep repeating things like &quot;might have continued as synonyms in science&quot;?  Just what, exactly, is it that you cannot understand about '''nearly seven and a half million Google hits for &quot;molecular weight&quot;'''?  That's not even considering ''atomic weight'' and ''at. wt.'' and ''formula weight'' and the like.  Let's deal with that before we go any further, okay?

:Where did you get the idea that the '''medical sciences''' are somehow excluded from '''science'''?

:Sure, &quot;it does [matter] thinking and writing about other celestial bodies.&quot;  But just where in the world do you imagine that Lunar Module was, when '''NASA''' tells us that its '''weight''' at liftoff of its ascent stage was &quot;10,776.6 lbs&quot;?

[[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 03:57, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm going to agree with David here.  There is a definite difference between weight and mass, and it needs to be made clear in a scientific book with an aim of instructing children.  Mass is the amount of matter in an object.  Weight is the force due to gravity being exerted on an object.  Grams is a unit of mass.  Newtons is a unit of force.  There is no scientific confusion in those terms.  

For an experiment, take a bathroom scale and climb a mountain.  You '''will weigh less''' at the top than at the bottom.  This is because a bathroom scale does not measure mass-  it measures weight.  Think of how it works-  it works by you depressing a spring due to the force of you standing on it.  Its working by measuring the force, '''not''' the mass.

So, how do we have pounds and ounces defined in terms of grams?  Such as the ketchup bottle or troy ounce you mentioned?  Simple-  weights are always reported in terms of weight at sea level.  When you assume a certain distance from a center of known mass, you can convert from mass to a weight by multiplying by g at that distance, then multiplying by the conversion factor.

Also, despite however many google hits you found, the correct term is not &quot;atomic weight&quot;.  It is &quot;atomic mass&quot;.  The reason for the term confusion is the same as the reason in other spheres-  antiquated usage from pre-physics days when we didn't know there was a difference.  If you search for atomic mass, you will find almost 15 millio google hits-  almost 3 times atomic weight.

I'm sorry Metric100, but your argument is wrong.  (By the way, does the name strike anyone else with irony)?  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 02:28, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, you are right.  Grams are units of mass, newtons are units of force.  When &quot;weight&quot; is measured in grams, it is a measurement of mass.  On those rare occcasions when &quot;weight&quot; is measured in newtons, it is a measurement of force.  That's what this module has tried to make clear. (Of course, there are also grams-force, units that have been deprecated since the International System of Units was introduced in 1960.  We still see far too many vestiges of their use, but almost never for anything that is called &quot;weight&quot;.  Rather, they are still used for things such as the thrust of jet and rocket engines, for tension of bicycle spokes, for pressure gauges in kg/cm², and things like that.)

:You have a totally confused notion of the definition of pounds and ounces.  Some sources have been cited above; I'll cite some more just after this reply.  Just look at that official definition in United States law, for example, the Federal Register Notice of July 1, 1959.  Show me where it says anything about gravity, or kilograms-force, or anything along those lines.  There's absolutely nothing like that in the definition.

:We often use spring scales in our bathrooms, because they are '''cheap''' and they do a reasonable job of recording differences over time, as long as we always use the same one.  But if you want to know what we are measuring, you need to look at what we measure when we get serious about our weight, and go to the doctor's office or the gym.

:Of course, your claim that pounds and ounces are defined &quot;in terms of weight at sea level&quot; is patently absurd.  What, exactly, is this &quot;weight at sea level&quot; in your estimation?  Note that the normal acceleration of gravity at the poles is 32.25780 ft/s², but normal gravity at the equator is only 32.08766 ft/s² (and local anomalies will make the total difference at sea level slightly more than that).  So, what would you say the &quot;weight&quot; is of that 12.5064 g gold bar, in the Wikipedia image linked to above?  How many pounds would that be, at sea level at the North Pole?  How many pounds would that be, at sea level at the equator?

:All those &quot;molecular weight&quot; hits are &quot;antiquated usage from pre-physics days&quot;?  Get real.  You can start by explaining why 25,800 of those hits were at the Harvard University site, and 773 of them at the site of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the keepers of our standards in the United States.


:You get more hits for &quot;atomic mass&quot; for two simple reasons. First, you didn't do an exact phrase search. To do that you need to put quotation marks around them, or use the advanced search input.  Doing that, I get 561,000 for &quot;atomic weight&quot; and 654,000 for &quot;atomic mass&quot;.  Second, there is a unit of mass called the &quot;atomic mass unit&quot;, or the modern preferred name &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; with the symbol &quot;u&quot; rahter than the obsolete &quot;amu&quot;.  Searching for site that include &quot;atomic mass&quot; but do not include &quot;atomic mass unit&quot; or &quot;atomic mass units&quot;, I get only 512,000 hits.  The same point can be made by looking at molecular weight, because we don't have a &quot;molecular weight unit&quot;.  Searching for the exact phrase &quot;molecular weight&quot; today, I get 8,400,000 hits, but searching for &quot;molecular mass&quot; I get only 1,780,000 hits.  

No irony at all; I'm smart enough to know what a pound is, and how it differs from a [[w:pound-force]], and what a [[w:kilogram-force]] is as well, and the difference between an ounce of platinum and an ounce of palladium, the difference between a Canadian ounce of Coca-Cola and a U.S. ounce of Coca-Cola, and the difference between a U.S. ounce of evaporated milk and a U.S. ounce of sweetened condensed milk, and the difference between a U.S. pint of blueberries and a U.S. pint of blueberry ice cream.  Can you come up with any better reasons to strongly prefer the modern post-1960 metric system.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 14:13, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== Use of Kilograms as a unit of &quot;weight&quot; ==

In this instance, I think it is very misleading to use the term &quot;kilogram&quot; for weight measurements.  Where we are at an impasse over is trying to find a way to describe the effects of gravity upon us when we are in a substantially different gravitational field, like standing on the Moon or Mars.

The most appropriate SI unit for describing the difference is the newton (OK, you've won that point Metric1000), because clearly a 100 kg person standing on a spring scale on the Earth will push down with 1000 newtons, while on the Moon it would only be 170 newtons.  The problem here is that your ''mass'' would still be 100 kg, and to this point Metric1000 is technically correct, but misses the point that the effect of gravity would be quite a bit different.

It is also correct that even space medicine discussions still use the term &quot;weight&quot; for astronauts while in orbit, even though they are in a micro-g environment (the ISS does have its own gravitational field, BTW, affecting some experiments done there).  The truth is, however, those discussions are done to relate to Earth-bound measurements and to keep consistant health concepts, not to describe the effects of a change of gravitational field.

The whole point of this section is to try and convey the fact that there are differences between the properties of mass, which doesn't change from one gravitational field to another, and to describe the effect of applying force while in that environment which does change.  You can still be crushed to death by a 1000 kg object traveling at 40 km/hr if you are between that object and a wall on the Moon.  Gravity will not make one bit of difference.  On the other hand, playing a game of soccer (to choose a more international sport) is going to be played quite a bit different on the Moon than on the Earth.  Hitting a golf ball on the Moon (it happened during the Apollo XV mission) is going to have that ball travel much further than on the Earth for several reasons, even with problems of trying to hit the ball while in a spacesuit.

Where this section needs to be rewritten is to come to a compromise between ignoring the fact that mass is the same everywhere and that gravitational fields do change.  Rather than trying to suggest that if you &quot;weigh&quot; 100 kg (using this as an example here) on the Earth you would &quot;weigh&quot; 17 kg on the Moon, it would be better to describe that if you can jump up 40 cm here on the Earth that you would be able to jump up much higher on the Moon.  Or if you can &quot;lift&quot; 100 kg on the Earth that you would be able to &quot;lift&quot; 600 kg on the Moon.

In short, rather than trying to digress into &quot;weight&quot; vs. &quot;mass&quot;, lets describe the effects of the change of gravity.  What is the same, and what is different?  If you were in a Jovian gravitational field, how different would things be with gravity going the other way?  Would your bones break just trying to jump at all?  How about on Phobos, where you could accidentally jump &quot;off&quot; the moon entirely if you jumped up too long, and that even a gentle pushup might take a couple of hours to come back to the ground after going more than 1 km high from that gentle push.

We can do a better job than the typical science textbook on this subject, and for that I do appreciate what Metric1000 is trying to accomplish by raising that bar.  On the other hand, we need to also acknowledge that there are distinctively different effects for many human activities when the gravitational environment is changed.  How do we describe that very different environment?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:07, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:It is much more misleading to bury your head in the sand and pretend that kilograms and pounds (units of mass) are not used to measure &quot;weight&quot;.
:We have ample evidence on this talk page showing that many of the editors here do not understand what that means.  Let's not raise another generation of kids with the same misconceptions.
:It is absolutely essential that we explain that the ''weight'' these students are most familiar with—''weight'' as we use it for buying and selling goods by weight, and for measuring human ''body weight'' for the purposes of health and fitness (the reasons we normally weigh ourselves)—is the same thing that some scientists like to call ''mass''.
:Otherwise, you are pretty much saying what I've been saying all along.  I guess I'll have to put together a list of all the silly statements that were originally placed in these modules, before I fixed them up a little bit. Claims that kilograms would change, etc. 
:For that golf ball, you'll get essentially the same speed off the club as you would swinging in a spacesuit on Earth; it just takes gravity longer to pull it back to the surface.  Of course, remember that in jumping, it is the change in the height of the center of gravity that matters most, and high jumpers and pole vaulters do not clear the bar in an upright position.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 13:37, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

::There are other effect that can be taken into consideration with the golf ball as well... Lack of atmospheric drag, and an increased curvature of the surface will also have a significant impact (the golf ball is on a sub-orbital ballistic trajectory, after all).  Still, I'm going to ignore those extra factors for this article.&lt;p&gt;I'm going to introduce a new &quot;section&quot; into this article going over precisely the concepts I've discussed, to explain what is different and what is the same in different gravitational fields.  Send arrows my way if you don't like what I've put in.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:03, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::: The &quot;formula&quot; that I used to determine height was trying to approximate how high a typical kid can jump up, and then go backward to try and find what the &quot;takeoff velocity&quot; was to reach that height.  Going backward, I found the time it took to get that high and doubled it to determine how long the kid is in the air.  Using basic equations of the laws of motion and assuming a consistant &quot;take off&quot; velocity I got the amount of time you would spend before accelleration due to gravity would bring that velocity to zero.  Plugging that time into the time-distance motion formula (1/2at^2+vt+s) in turn gave me the height a kid would reach if they were jumping up.&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I think this is a better way to approach the subject.  And these are things that kids can relate to as well...perhaps better than &quot;how much I weigh on X&quot;.  I'd like to do some calculations on a kid kicking a ball, but I need to determine the vertical component to do the calculations.  Any thoughts? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:19, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::::The curvature is totally irrelevant on the scale of a golf ball's travel.
::::Other factors come into play in lifting things, too, of course.  For example, whenever you lift something, you are also lifting at least part of your own body at the same time.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 12:23, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::While I would agree you are also &quot;lifting&quot; your arm, but as I pointed out that only on the Earth itself is this a significant factor anyway.  I'm just trying to present some &quot;hard numbers&quot; that kids can compare their experiences to that do show a difference in gravity has different experiences.  I would also like to try and find some experiences that would demonstrate where pushing mass is the same regardless of what planet or moon you happened to be standing on.  Getting hit by a bullet from a gun and getting crushed by a car against a wall seem a little too gruesome for a kids book, even though it is an accurate depiction.  I would be very careful about pushing large mass objects around on Phobos, because kenetic energy of an object will be identical everywhere.  You just don't have the large acceleration due to gravity like you find on the Earth.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:58, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

'''There is only one pound, but it has two definitions.''' I oppose the idea that references to pound as mass, or pound as weight, must be corrected. See [[User:Kernigh/pound]] for details. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:28, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, there are still three pounds in use as units of mass, and one and only one pound-force.  Pounds-force are uniquely identified by that name.  They are such a recent spinoff that of all the hundreds of different pounds used at various times and places throughout history, only one of them has spawned a unit of force of the same name that has seen anysignificant use.

:As far as your user page goes, you do understand that slugs are a 20th century invention, first used early in that century but not appearing in physics books until about 1940, don't you?  And completely gone from almost all physics books now, except maybe in a table of conversion factors?

:When the U.S. first defined the pound as 0.4535924277 kg exactly, slugs did not exist.

:Do you know what a poundal is?  Tell us.  Note also that poundals did exist in 1893/1894, and the metrologists doing the redefining of the pound would have been aware of their use.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 10:45, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

::I Dont really see any reason for all the confusion. Why would you write something that--while it might be factually correct in some limited sense--only serves to increase confusion?

:::Get real.  My ketchup bottle, and that of the American kids this is apparently aimed at now, says it has a &quot;net weight&quot; of &quot;24 oz (1 lb 8 oz) 680 g&quot;.  Both English and metric units, that's standard.  That's &quot;weight&quot;, whether it is pounds or pounds and ounces or grams.  Those are units of mass, not units of force, whether they are pounds or ounces or grams.  No manufacturer ever makes two different measurements to put on the label, and no manufacturer ever varies the relationship between those two numbers based on the local gravity at the place where this product will be sold (and variations on Earth certainly are great enough to that it would vary at the gram level if these were grams force).

:::Even in the United States, many hospitals measure the &quot;weight&quot; of their patients in kilograms, and those are the proper units for this used throughout the world.  When pounds are used in the United States, this &quot;weight&quot; is not measured by a different method than when it is measured in kilograms, and it is not measured using units that are not units of mass just as the kilograms used throughout the world are units of mass.
:::There are already a zillion sources cited here for those facts.  Did you forget to ask yourself the obvious question, &quot;Why in the world does the law bother to define a pound in the first place?&quot; 
 
:::Those kids, and even our Whiteknight in shining armor, have not only seen that &quot;net weight&quot; on packages, but have also heard of other things like &quot;carat weight&quot; and &quot;bantamweight&quot; and maybe even a unit of mass (never of force) called a &quot;hundredweight&quot;; a few probably even know what &quot;atomic weight&quot; means.

::::Mass ignorance is not correctness, no matter how many ketchup bottles the equivalency is listed on. On earth, gravity is ''basically'' a constant, with a value that can be reasonably rounded off and used in general. When your ketchup bottle shows that the product weighs a certain amount (be it in pounds or ounces), the eqivalent mass in SI can be calculated out in grams. Too few people are familiar with Newtons to make a direct weight -&gt; weight conversion. The fact that gravity is nearly equivalent in all places where a person could make a perminent residence in which to store and consume their ketchup, does not change the fact that the conversion formula is pretty standardized. Also, keep in mind that the people marketing the ketchup are rarely scientists or engineers, but are instead artists and business majors who may not all be well-versed in the specifics of unit conversions. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::You are absolutely right about mass ignorance not being correctness.  It isn't, of course, a matter of &quot;the conversion formula is pretty standardized&quot;.  There's no &quot;pretty&quot; about it.  Rather, it is in fact exact.  Pounds are, by definition, units of mass exactly equal to 0.45359237 kg, since that international agreement of 46 years ago.

:::::It wasn't, of course, &quot;artists&quot; and &quot;business majors&quot; who did the redefining, though there's a pretty good chance they could do better than Whiteknight would.   I'm absolutely buffaloed figure out why anybody would think that it would be a good idea to measure a quantity that varies with the strength of the local gravitational field, when we are buying and selling goods by weight.

:::::The defining was instead done by the experts in the field, the professional metrologists of the national standards laboratories of six of the major industrial nations of the world. 

:::::Of course it also is not a matter of &quot;Too few people are familiar with Newtons to make a direct weight -&gt; weight conversion.&quot;  That is quite ludicrous on two grounds.  First of all, there is no place in the whole world where newtons are legal units for the sale of goods.  Second, there is no place in the world where the sale of goods in pounds-force is legal; you are not starting out with pounds-force in the first place.

:I was referring to troy pounds (which, unlike their avoirdupois cousins, and unlike grams and kilograms as well, are never units of force, and metric pounds still in informal use in much of the world, stemming from 19th century redefinitions of various local pounds.  They are 500 g exactly, and naturally those are units of mass as well.  Note also that from the time of Henry VII until at least after 1850, there were no independent primary standards for an avoirdupois pound.  Rather, they were defined as an exact fraction of a different unit of mass, just as they are today, only in that case the other unit of mass was the troy pound and today it is the kilogram.  THere were then, and are now, various secondary standards representing the avoirdupois pound, of course.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 20:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[w:Natsume Soseki|Natsume Soseki]] (夏目漱石) is one of Japan's most important authors. This is a short work by him.

== イズムの功過 ==
'''夏目漱石'''

大抵(たいてい)のイズムとか主義とかいうものは無数の事実を几帳面（きちょうめん）な男が束（たば）にして頭の抽出（ひきだし）へ入れやすいように拵（こしら）えてくれたものである。一纏（ひとまと）めにきちりと片付いている代りには、出すのが臆劫（おっくう）になったり、解（ほど）くのに手数がかかったりするので、いざという場合には間に合わない事が多い。大抵のイズムはこの点において、実生活上の行為を直接に支配するために作られたる指南車（しなんしゃ）というよりは、吾人（ごじん）の知識欲を充たすための統一函である。文章ではなくって字引である。

 [[wikt:イズム|イズム]] = &quot;ism&quot; (e.g., communism, socialism, realism)
 [[wikt:功過|功過]] (こうか) = merits and demerits; good and bad points
 [[wikt:主義|主義]] (しゅぎ) = doctrine or principle; rule
 [[wikt:無数|無数]] (むすう) = uncountable number, countless; infinite
 [[wikt:拵える|拵える]] (こしらえる) = to make; to manufacture
 [[wikt:一纏|一纏め]] (ひとまとめ) = bundle; pack; bunch


同時に多くのイズムは、零砕（れいさい）の類例が、比較的緻密（ちみつ）な頭脳に濾過（ろか）されて凝結（ぎょうけつ）した時に取る一種の形である。形といわんよりはむしろ輪廓（りんかく）である。中味（なかみ）のないものである。中味を棄てて輪廓だけを畳（たた）み込むのは、天保銭（てんぽうせん）を脊負う代りに紙幣を懐（ふところ）にすると同じく小さな人間として軽便（けいべん）だからである。

この意味においてイズムは会社の決算報告に比較すべきものである。更に生徒の学年成績に匹敵（ひってき）すべきものである。僅（わずか）一行の数字の裏面（りめん）に、僅か二位の得点の背景に殆どありのままには繰返しがたき、多くの時と事と人間と、その人間の努力と悲喜と成敗（せいはい）とが潜（ひそ）んでいる。

従ってイズムは既に経過せる事実を土台として成立するものである。過去を総束（そうそく）するものである。経験の歴史を簡略にするものである。与えられたる事実の輪廓である。型である。この型を以て未来に臨（のぞ）むのは、天の展開する未来の内容を、人の頭で拵（こしら）えた器（うつわ）に盛終（もりおお）せようと、あらかじめ待ち設（もう）けると一般である。器械的な自然界の現象のうち、尤（もっと）も単調な重複（ちょうふく）を厭（いと）わざるものには、すぐこの型を応用して実生活の便宜を計る事が出来るかも知れない。科学者の研究が未来に反射するというのはこのためである。しかし人間精神上の生活において、吾人がもし一イズムに支配されんとするとき、吾人は直（ただち）に与えられたる輪廓のために生存するの苦痛を感ずるものである。単に与えられたる輪廓の方便として生存するのは、形骸（けいがい）のために器械の用をなすと一般だからである。その時わが精神の発展が自個天然の法則に遵（したが）って、自己に真実なる輪廓を、自（みずか）らと自らに付与し得ざる屈辱を憤（いきどお）る事さえある。

精神がこの屈辱を感ずるとき、吾人はこれを過去の輪廓がまさに崩れんとする前兆と見る。未来に引き延ばしがたきものを引き延ばして無理にあるいは盲目的に利用せんとしたる罪過（ざいか）と見る。

過去はこれらのイズムに因って支配せられたるが故に、これからもまたこのイズムに支配せられざるべからずと臆断（おくだん）して、一短期の過程より得たる輪廓を胸に蔵して、凡（すべ）てを断ぜんとするものは、升（ます）を抱いて高さを計り、かねて長さを量（はか）らんとするが如き暴挙である。

自然主義なるものが起（おこ）って既に五、六年になる。これを口にする人は皆それぞれの根拠あっての事と思う。わが知る限りにおいては、またわが了解し得たる限りにおいては（了解し得ざる論議は暫（しばら）く措（お）いて）必ずしも非難すべき点ばかりはない。けれども自然主義もまた一つのイズムである。人生上芸術上、ともに一種の因果によって、西洋に発展した歴史の断面を、輪廓にして舶載（はくさい）した品物である。吾人がこの輪廓の中味を充※(「仞」のにんべんに代えて牛へん、第4水準2-80-18)（じゅうじん）するために生きているのでない事は明（あきら）かである。吾人の活力発展の内容が、自然にこの輪廓を描いた時、始めて自然主義に意義が生ずるのである。

一般の世間は自然主義を嫌っている。自然主義者はこれを永久の真理の如くにいいなして吾人生活の全面に渉（わた）って強（し）いんとしつつある。自然主義者にして今少し手強（てごわ）く、また今少し根気よく猛進したなら、自（おのずか）ら覆（くつがえ）るの未来を早めつつある事に気がつくだろう。人生の全局面を蔽（おお）う大輪廓を描いて、未来をその中に追い込もうとするよりも、茫漠（ぼうばく）たる輪廓中の一小片を堅固に把持（はじ）して、其処
（そこ）に自然主義の恒久（こうきゅう）を認識してもらう方が彼らのために得策（とくさく）ではなかろうかと思う。

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an alternate version of the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] module which:

# Tries to stay simple and succinct (although I realise there's room for improvement, e.g. shorter sentence lengths, fewer subclauses, etc);
# Does not refer to mass (uses &quot;bulk&quot; or &quot;bulky&quot; instead);
# Does not refer to force (uses &quot;pull&quot; instead);
# Does not refer to units;
# Does not &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; that weight changes, but rather that (underline emphases added):
:: &quot;You may've read or heard people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y that your weight would be different on the Moon...&quot;;
:: &quot;[the bathroom scale] would &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y you weighed less than when you weighed yourself with it on the Earth. So people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y your weight has changed...&quot;
:: &quot;it's &lt;u&gt;as if&lt;/u&gt; ... you have no weight...&quot;

If people think this approach is a starter then I think a couple of illustrations or diagrams and perhaps a table of what a bathroom scale would say you weighed on other planets would add interest to the page.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 02:30, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:IMHO (this is a talk page after all, I'm not adding content here), the whole premise that we should avoid units, nor discuss differences between mass and weight is simply a school of thought on this topic, and just one of several approaches.  The whole point to this discussion is to describe the effects of a variation of gravity from one place to another.  The problem with the previous [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight]] is that it violated NPOV standards with no attempt to have a compromise or come to a true neutral point of view on the topic.

:This module is a fork of content, and as such will eventually have to be reconsiled and/or merged with the other module.  It is fine to try and write another module that gives an alternative point of view seeking compromise and still being technically accurate.  Perhaps that is exactly what we need to do:  Write several different modules and then try to &quot;vote&quot; on which one is best for inclusion into Wikijunior Solar System.  Thanks for trying to be a solution to the problem rather than a cause.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:53, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== good job on this ==

This is a pretty good start, although i warn that some of the current explanations can be a little bit technical and convoluted (remember, the target audience is children, not feuding, well-educated wikibookians). Although, maybe kids can understand this stuff, i can't remember how smart i was when i was a kid. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for your encouragement, Whiteknight. I reread the text earlier and agree it could and probably should be further simplified (e.g. shorter sentences, such as for &quot;The Moon, for example, is less bulky than the Earth, so if you weighed yourself there...&quot;). I'd hope, however, that given further simplification, a couple of illustrations and maybe a table, it's nearer an end rather than a start &amp;mdash; if, that is, more people think it's worth using. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 22:50, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

== Well written -- maybe too much for this book ==

This is a well-written module.
I think it is too much for a book that is supposed to be only 48 pages in total, and which already contains a section on gravity, mass, and weight ([[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight]]).

The book is overloaded.  It will soon be large enough to be a textbook for a year-long course in the solar system for elementery students.

Though this section is mostly well-written, I would be happy to remove it entirely.  Perhaps it could find a new home in another book.  A physics book for children.  &quot;Force and Motion -- how things move&quot;.

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 12:07, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for your comments, SV Resolution. I agree that its all too easy for Wikijunior books to become overgrown, but this module [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] is offered as a ''replacement'' for [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] (or, at least, most of a replacement). I feel a decision needs to be reached as to whether one or other of these modules is included, or none like them at all. I think there's a case for including such a module, as I've already come across areas in the book where it might usefully be referenced, e.g. the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Comets|Comets]] module which I have been (but have currently suspended) copyediting. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 12:26, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

I think either [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] or [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] would be too much for this book.  Before either of these two sections were begun, there was already a subsection of [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System]] called [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System#About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] (sorry for the earlier, confusing typo)  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 16:11, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

: Ah, I see what you mean. I also see the page needs a little formatting attention (e.g. dashes) so I intend to review it. Are there any Wikijunior contributors able to test the Solar System content on some young people, to see what might be missing, boring, over-pitched, etc? &amp;nbsp;I think this is very important. Unfortunately I am not readily able to do so.

: Thanks again for your interest, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 21:50, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I have had trouble with some of the obtuse language in both this module [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight]]. The latter module (gravity, mass, and weight) contained wording about inertia which I removed (though you can still see in the source - &quot;edit this page&quot;).

:: This module (weight and gravity) was an alternate approach without mentioning mass. But it does mention mass; it uses the word ''bulky'' instead of the word ''mass''.

:: As it is, I have little familiarity with Wikijunior, and I prefer not to claim that these modules are &quot;well-writen&quot;. I was wondering if the best solution was to move both modules out of Wikijunior. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:43, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for your input, Kernigh. The consensus, although small, seems to be to include neither module. I'll therefore let some time pass and then, if they're still there, remove mention of the [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About weight and gravity]] from the [[Wikijunior Solar System#Main modules|Main modules]] and [[Wikijunior Solar System#Other modules|Other modules]] lists. Apologies for not making clear that it was the ''word'' &quot;mass&quot; I was aiming not to use, for the sake of younger readers. Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 14:17, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

:I think this module has merit.  I don't think it should be moved out of Wikijunior.  Just out of Wikijunior Solar System. &quot;How Things Move&quot; -- dyamics for children.--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 01:56, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Nineteenth century ==

* 1837 - Charles Babbage designs the first programmable computer called the &quot;Analytical Engine&quot;.  This was designed to use punch cards of the type used in Jacquard looms. Ada Lovelace wrote a program for the machine. The Analytical Engine is probably the first &quot;Turing Complete&quot; computer design.
* 1847-1854 George Boole develops Boolean algebra which is the foundation of the hardware design of all modern digital computers.
* Mid-late nineteenth century mechanical and electromechanical adding machines developed and widely used.

== The 20's ==

* 1920's - German Enigma Machine, an electromechanical rotor machine is widely used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Although this was not a computer, being more like an advanced adding machine, its role in World War II stimulated computer design for decryption machines.

== The 30's ==

* 1936, May 28 - Alan Turing submits &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot;

*1966 - internet - Larry Roberts heads the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's project to create the first ever packet switched network, largely considered unworkable by experts
*1968 - software - Doug Engelbart presents his team's work in a 90-minute live public demonstration of a personal (super) computer. This demonstration is now known as The Mother Of All Demos. Among other things, the NLS system has hypertext and distributed collaboration.
*1968 - hardware - Intel formed by Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, &amp; Andy Grove.
*1969 - software - Unix created at AT&amp;T's Bell Telephone Labs by Ken Thompson &amp; Dennis Ritchie.

Despite early successes with children, Alan Kay will decide that this is a more or less impossible goal and fall back on reimplementing Smalltalk.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1972&lt;/span&gt; C programming language created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/span&gt; Unix rewritten in C, becoming the first operating system written in a language other than Assembly, which action decisively wins for Unix the OS wars despite its many shortcomings.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1973&lt;/span&gt; Gary Kildall writes the CP/M operating system.

*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1978&lt;/span&gt; - Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of ''The C Programming Language'' (&quot;K&amp;R&quot;).

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; Steve Jobs visits Xerox PARC in exchange for allowing Xerox to invest $1 million in Apple. He's shown the first ever computer network, the first ever graphical interface and object-oriented programming. Xerox will soon disinvest from Apple, before its success.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; Ted Nelson convenes The Xanadu Group to work on a storage system for his visionary sophisticated hypertext system called Xanadu.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; May - [[w:Seattle Computer Products|Seattle Computer Products (SCP)]] a Seattle, Washington microcomputer hardware company thanks to Tim Patterson had a working prototype for Intel's 8086 by May 1979. Tim Patterson, hired in June 1978 by SCP's owner Rod Brock, was successful in redirecting the company's focus, a process that began after his attendance at a local seminar on Intel's just-released 8086 in late summer 1978.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; November - Seattle Computer Products (SCP) begins shipping its first S-100 bus 8086 CPU boards to customers including Microsoft BASIC as an option, but no operating system was available. It will soon be one of the first manufacturers of computer systems based on the 16-bit Intel 8086 processor and a crucial player in the history of the industry, even a cautionary tale. 

== The 80's ==
{{TODO|Cleanup, add Microsoft formation and Microsfot BASIC, Missing IBM and Itel path.}}
*In the United Kingdom of the early 1980s, the pioneer of computing technology was Cambridge-educated Sir Clive Sinclair. Sinclair had made his money on innovative electronic products such as calculators and radios. In fact Sir Clive is credited with the invention of the world's first pocket television. In 1980 Sinclair released the sub-£100 ZX80. This paved the way for the ZX81 and the biggie, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in 1982. The Spectrum became Britain's fastest-selling computer, despite its relative paucity of features compared to rival computers such as the Commodore 64 and the Amstrad 464.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; - Usenet is created as a &quot;poor man's ARPANET&quot;.

*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; June - Commodore debutes the VIC-20 (VIC 1001 in Japan, VC-20 in Germany) at the Consumer Electronics Show. First computer in history to produce over one million units.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; April - Seattle Computer Products (SCP) start development of QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System). Tim Patterson the author was charged to develop a new OS for 16-Bit machines based on CP/M after SCP business stalled due to the delay of [[w:CP/M-86|CP/M-86]] OS that was expected by the end of 1979. Developed over a four-month period. QDOS 0.11 was finished in August 1980. SCP is oblivious to the fact that Microsoft has represented the OS to IBM as their own product.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; September - Seattle Computer Products (SCP) began shipping QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System).
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt; December - Microsoft buys QDOS after selling it to IBM for a massive profit. The original O/S CPM/86 by Digital is not ready for release and IBM needs something to bridge the gap. Bill Gates negotiates an unusual contract which lets Microsoft retain the right to independently market QDOS, which it proceeds to do as MS-DOS. This one borrowed piece of software launches Microsoft's meteoric rise to success. 
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1981&lt;/span&gt; August - The IBM PC is introduced. 8-bit computing is widespread on the desktop, but the 16-bit IBM machine is about to change that.
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1981&lt;/span&gt; November - Commodore's MOS Technology finishes the VIC-II video processor chip. Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel orders a 64K computer using this chip.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/span&gt; -  Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie publish the second edition of ''The C Programming Language'' (covering &quot;ANSI C&quot;).

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/span&gt; - OS/2 is released.
*&lt;span class=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/span&gt; The Giant Magneto-Resistive effect is discovered, which will soon enable a second speedup in the rate of increase of hard drive capacities. The MR and GMR together turn storage from the slowest growing of the (storage, computation, networking) triad into the fastest, upsetting the economics of computation forevermore.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;1989&lt;/span&gt; [[w:Tim_Berners-Lee|Tim Berners-Lee]] creates HTML.

*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1990&lt;/span&gt; - Microsoft launches Windows 3.0, the first version to achieve widespread use, and then drops out of development for OS/2. Microsoft proceeds to take OS/2 technology as the core for Windows NT.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1990&lt;/span&gt; Self is publicly released.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1991&lt;/span&gt; The Self team moves to Sun Microsystems where they develop Just-In-Time compilation HotSpot technology that will eventually make its way into Java.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1991&lt;/span&gt; - Sun begins work on Java as an inferior version of Smalltalk aimed at C/C++ developers.
*&lt;span class=&quot;software&quot;&gt;1991&lt;/span&gt; - Linus Torvalds releases the first version of Linux, his free Unix kernel clone; now used by millions of users worldwide usually on top of GNU.

Thin client processing gets new life.
*&lt;span class=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/span&gt; Dual core processors permit Moore's Law to continue by reducing microprocessor heating. Clock speeds level off at 4000 MHz and chip resolution heads for 65 nm. Motherboards with up to 16 64-bit processors are available. Multiple-gigabyte memories for desktop computers are available. 200 gB hard drives are common.

== The 10's ==
{{NOTE|The time line ends here since it is improbable to determine how any new technology will impact or be relevant on the long run. For instance in 2010 April, Apple releases the iPad will still be hard to claim that it was an innovation in itself and with a long lasting impact or for instance claiming that 2010 was the year that Dual-Core processing and 64-bit Operating systems become standard is also a stretch.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting Started ==

=== Things you need ===

*[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3&amp;displaylang=en .Net Framework 1.1]
*[http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/ Visual Studio .Net]
*[http://desktop.google.com/developer.html Google Desktop SDK]

=== How to get started ===

You need to create a COM object

=== What is a COM object and why do I need to create it? ===

GD uses COM objects as plugins. Actually these are like ActiveX components. They are meant to be reusable.

=== How to create a COM object ===

In Visual Studio, create a C# Class Library. 

=== Preliminary code for the Class Library project ===

You should implement two (2) methods: 

 static void ComRegisterFunctionAttribute(Type t) {
 ''include initialization code here''
 }

This function is called whenever you register your COM object to the system. You can put initialization code here, like code that will register our plugin to GD (Details later). 

 static void ComUnregisterFunctionAttribute(Type t) {
 }

This function is called whenever you unregister your COM object. 

You should have the following statement:

 using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

=== What kind of files are created when I compile my Class Library project? ===

After building your Class Library project, Visual Studio will generate the following file types in your output folder: .dll and .tlb

The .dll file generated is actually a COM object that we need to register to the system.

=== How to load/register a COM object ===

 Use: regasm [dllfile] /tlb

Regasm.exe is located in your .Net Framework bin folder.

=== What method/code is first executed after I load a COM object? ===

The system makes a call to ComRegisterFunctionAttribute so it is necessary that you implement this method. It is here where we put our initialization, like a block of code that will register our plugin to GD.

=== Registering the plugin to GD ===

 try {
 GoogleDesktopRegistrarClass registrar = new GoogleDesktopRegistrarClass();
 // Start component registration by specifying our attributes
 object[] descriptions = {
 &quot;Title&quot;, pluginName,
 &quot;Description&quot;, pluginName,
 &quot;Icon&quot;, &quot;&quot;
 };
 
 registrar.StartComponentRegistration(controlGuid, descriptions);
 
 IGoogleDesktopRegisterDisplayPlugin displayRegistration = 
 (IGoogleDesktopRegisterDisplayPlugin)
 
 registrar.GetRegistrationInterface(&quot;GoogleDesktop.DisplayPluginRegistration&quot;);
 
 displayRegistration.RegisterPlugin(controlGuid, false);
 // Done with component registration.
 registrar.FinishComponentRegistration();
 }
 catch (Exception e) {
 MessageBox.Show(&quot;Exception thrown during registration. Description=&quot; + e.Message);
 }

=== What happens when my plugin is registered in GD? ===

Your plugin will appear in the add/remove panel list in Google Desktop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mental Math - A Guide to Effective Mental Calculations ==
''Note about Notation: This book generally uses the English/U.S. styles of notation. This includes using commas as a way to divide up the thousands in long numbers (e.g. 32,000 = thirty-two thousand), it will use full stops (periods) as decimal points.''
Calculating things in your head can be a difficult task. If you can't remember what you've worked out or simply don't know how to solve a problem then it can be very challenging and frustrating. But by learning and practicing the methods of using mathematical patterns, you can dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of your arithmetic.  These methods are often called &quot;High Speed Mental Math&quot;.
Mental Math is a valuable skill to have, even in the computerized world we live in:
# With good mental math skills you can save yourself time by not needing to pull out a calculator (or cell phone) every time you want to do a task.
# Mental math skills will improve your ability to estimate results, thus having a better ability to catch errors from computer-derived results.  For example, while a calculator will generally give the right answer, based upon what was typed in, if you accidentally typed the wrong number, you might not catch your error if you didn't have good mental arithmetic skills.

== Addition ==
The foundation of all arithmetic is addition, also known as summing. Similar to all mental math calculations, you can improve your ability to add numbers by learning to use some basic patterns.
=== Changing the Order of Addition ===
Often when looking for a pattern to help you quickly do an addition problem, it can help to change the order that you add things.  For example, 8+1 is the same as 1+8, and in both cases you just count up one from 8, to get the answer 9.   If you get stumped on an addition problem, try changing the order of which one you add first, and see if it helps.
=== Adding Zero, One, or Two ===
Unless you are completely new to addition, you surely know the pattern for adding I zero.  Anything plus zero is equal to the original number.  Thus when you see a zero in an addition problem, you can basically ignore it, as it won't have any effect upon the answer.   For those who are interested in math trivia, this property of zero not changing things when you add it, is called the &quot;identity property&quot; in arithmetic.  Also, keep in mind, that you can only ignore zero in addition, and sometimes in subtraction.  In multiplication and division, having a zero in a problem always changes things.
You probably also know the rule of adding 1, which is simply count up one number.  This can also be used quickly with 2, where you can either count up 2 numbers, or if you know your even and odd numbers well, you can skip to the next even or odd.
To understand using the even and odd pattern, you may be familiar with the cheer that has the even numbers: &quot;2,4,6,8, who do we appreciate?&quot;   If we add 6+2 we will go up to the next even number, which is 8.  Similarly, the odd numbers go 1,3,5,7 so 2+7 will be the next odd number, which is 9.
=== Adding Nine or Eight: Counting Down from 10 ===
Another arithmetic pattern you surely know is how to add 10 to a number.  An example of this is 2+10 is 12, or 6+10 is 16.  We can use this pattern to help us add 9 or 8.  Since 9 is one less than 10, you can always add 9 to something by adding 10 to the number instead and then counting down one.  For instance to find 9+7, you can add 10+7, which is 17, and then count down to 16. 
Similarly with adding 8 to a number, you can also add 10, and then count down 2 numbers.  So for instance, 8+7 can be found by adding 10+7 which is 17, and then counting down 2, which is 15.  If you are good with knowing your even and odd numbers, you can also use a similar pattern as was explained with adding 2, by just going down one even or odd number.
or you could say when it's adding 9 you know it's going to a higher number for instance 9+8 you know it's going to be a teen so subtract one 9+8 = 1 now subtract one from 8 to get 7 now put them next to each other to get 17.

=== Doubling and Nearly Doubling ===
You may already be good at doubling numbers, such as 2+2.  When doubling a number, you are doing the same thing as multiplying by 2.  This also means, that if you have learned to count by numbers, such as counting by 4's, you know that it is 4, 8, 12, 16...  And thus 4+4 is 8.  
Once you have become good at doubling, you can use this knowledge to add numbers that are nearly double of each other, by just counting up or down by one.  So for instance, 8+7 can be found by adding 8+8, which is 16, and then counting down by 1, which is 15.  (If it is easier, you could also have done this by doing 7+7, which is 14, and then counting up 1 to 15.)
=== Adding Fives ===
This technique is a little trickier than the others we have so far talked about, but with some practice it might help you out.  When adding 5 to another number, the goal is to &quot;find the five inside&quot; the other number, and then add or subtract what is left.  For instance when adding 5+8, you could say that 8 is 5+3, so 5+8 is 5+5+3, or 13.  Don't worry if you can't get this method, because most of the time you can use one of the other methods that have been taught to find the answer.
=== To Ten or Close ===
It is useful to memorize the patterns that add to 10 which are:
* 0+10
* 1+9
* 2+8
* 3+7
* 4+6
* 5+5
By knowing these patterns, if you see a pattern a little different you will know to go one higher or lower.  For instance, 4+7 has the 7 one higher than 6, so this must add up to 11, because 4+6=10 so 4+6+1=11.
=== Summing Groups of Numbers by Finding Numbers that Add to Multiples of 10 ===
A useful trick when adding lots of small numbers is to clump together the ones that add up to multiples of 10.  For example, if you have to add 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 8, that can be rearranged as (3 + 7) + (9 + 11) + (2 + 8) + 5 = 10 + 20 + 10 + 5 = 45.
This method is also useful when performing column addition with more than two numbers. For example, in the problem:
  56
  35
  47
  21
  12
  32
 +23 
 ---
Column addition is generally performed by adding the digits in the ones place, carrying them over, and then adding the digits in the tens place., and so on. A way to make this task easier is to group the digits in the ones place in groups of ten, and mark them on your paper like this:
  5 6
  3 5
  4 &lt;s&gt;7&lt;/s&gt;\
  2 1 \
  1 2  -- 10
  3 2 /
 +2 &lt;s&gt;3&lt;/s&gt;/ 
 ---
 
Similarly the 6, 2, and 2 would be crossed off, yielding another 10. Therefore the digits in the ones place add up to 10+10+5+1 (what's left) or 26.
== Subtraction ==
A useful trick when subtracting numbers is to begin with the smaller value and mentally skip your way up the difference, with jumping points at recognizable boundaries, such as powers of 10.  For example, to subtract 67 from 213 I would start with 67, then add 3 + 30 + 100 + 13.  Try this once and you see how easy it is. Sounding out your thoughts it would be &quot;three, thirty-three, one hundred thirty-three plus the remaining 13 is one hundred forty-six&quot;. 
A second method is to break up the number that you are subtracting. So instead of doing 1000-258 you would do 1000-250 and then subtract 8.
=== Subtraction from Numbers consisting of 1 followed by zeros: 100; 1,000; 10,000; etc===
For example 1,000 - 258
We simply subtract each digit in 258 from 9 and the last digit from 10.
          2           5             8
          from 9      from 9        from 10
          7           4             2
So the answer is 1,000 - 258 = 742

Note that if the number being subtracted (the minuend) ends in a series of zeros, you subtract the last ''nonzero'' digit from 10, and leave the trailing zeros alone. E.g.: 10,000 - 5920 = {9-5}{9-9}{10-2}0 = 4080.
This always works for subtractions from numbers consisting of a 1 followed by zeroes: 100; 1000; 10,000 etc.
Another way of easily thinking of this method is to always subtract from 999 if subtracting from 1,000, and then adding 1 back. Same for 10,000, subtract from 9999 and add 1. For example, 1000-555 =    999 - 555 + 1= 444 + 1 = 445
Similarly 10,000 - 1068 = (9999-1068)+1 = (8931)+1 =8932
So the answer is 10,000 - 1068 = 8932
For 1,000 - 86, in which we have more zeros than figures in the numbers being subtracted, we simply suppose 86 is 086. 
So 1,000 - 86 becomes 1,000 - 086 = 914
=== Bigger Numbers using the 9s Trick (10's Complement Addition) ===
The above technique can be extended to arbitrarily long numbers in the following way: subtract the minuend from the next power of ten greater than the subtrahend using the nines trick above, then ''add'' the result to the subtrahend instead, but don't carry the final '1'.

Example:
 1,254,953-34,064
34,064 becomes 9,965,936 via the nines trick (notice we pad the beginning with 9's to make it the same length as the subtrahend). Now add:
 11   1 1
  1,254,953
 +9,965,936
  1,220,889
And again notice that we do not include the final carried '1' on the left in our result.

=== Subtracting Left-to-Right ===
Normal subtraction is performed right-to-left, borrowing from the left when a borrow is needed. However, we read left to right, and numbers are read out loud to us in this same order, so it is convenient to be able to subtract left-to-right as well. We can do this by going ahead and pre-borrowing by default and then adding back a carry (if there is one) when we move on to the next column if it turns out we didn't need to borrow. This technique also cuts down on the amount of mental work one must do to propagate a borrow from right to left.

Example:
  9543
 -1992
First preborrow from the 9, leaving 8 and subtract the thousands place:
   1
  8543
 -1992
  7
Now preborrow from the 15 in the hundreds place, leaving a 14, and subtract:
   11
  8443
 -1992
  75
Now preborrow from the 14 in the tens place, leaving a 13, and subtract:
   111
  8133
 -1992
  754
Last column, we have nothing to borrow from, so we just subtract. In this case, we don't get a single digit, so we carry it back to the tens place:
   111
  8133
 -1992
  7551
And we're done! 7551 is the correct answer.

== Multiplication ==
=== Multiplication Facts for 0 through 10 ===
==== Patterns for 0, 1 and 10 ====
Chances are you already know the pattern for multiplying by 0, 1 and 10.  But in case you don't, anything times 0 is 0.  Anything times 1, is itself still, and anything times 10 has a zero added to the end, so 29x10 is 290.
==== Patterns for 2, 4, and 8 ====
Multiplying by 2 is simply doubling a number, and so the pattern for doubling with addition is the same. 
Multiplying by 4 is doubling twice.  So 12x4, can be found by going 12+12 which is 24 and then 24+24 which is 48.
Similarly, multiplying by 8 is doubling 3 times, so 12x8 is 12+12 which is 24, then 24+24 which is 48, and then 48+48 which is 96.
==== Patterns for 3 and 6 ====
Multiplying by 3 can be done by doubling and then adding the number to itself, so 12x3 is 12+12 which is 24, and then add 12 to that which is 36. 
Multiplying by 6 is similar in that it is doubling first, and then multiplying by 3.  
==== Patterns for 9 ====
Multiplying by 9 has a special pattern.  When multiplying a single digit by 9, the answer will always start with a digit one less than the number, and then the other number will add to 9.  This may sound complex, but lets look at an example.   If we want to do 9x6, simply have your first digit being one less than 6, so we know the answer will start with a 5, then then next digit must add up to 9, so the number that when added to 5 will equal 9, is 4, so the answer of 9x6 is 54.  Another way to think of this method is you're multiplying the number by 10, then subtracting the number from the product. If you think of it this way, then this example becomes 10x6 = 60, then 60-6 = 54.
==== Patterns for 5 ====
Any number multiplied by 5 will end in either a 5 or a 0.  One way of finding the answer is to multiply by 10 first, and then divide your answer in half.  Another is to count by fives.
==== &quot;Number Neighbors&quot; ====
If you don't know the answer to a problem, you may know the answer to a problem where one of the numbers is one more or less than the one in the problem.  For instance, if you didn't know the answer to  7 x 6, you  might know 6 x 6 is 36, and then you could just add one more 6 to get to 42.
=== Multiplying Larger Numbers === 
When multiplying larger numbers it is very important to pick the correct sums to do. If you multiply 251 by 323 straight off it can be very difficult, but it is actually a very easy sum if approached in the right way. 251x3 + 251x20 + 251x300 is a scary prospect, so you have to work out the simplest method.
====Rounding====
One of the first things to do is to look if the numbers are near anything easy to work out. In this example there is, very conveniently, the number 251, which is next to 250. So all you have to do is 323x250 + 323 - much easier, but 323x250 still doesn't look too simple. There is, however, an easy way of multiplying by 250 which can also apply to other numbers. You multiply by 1000 then divide by 4. So 323x1000 = 323,000, divide by two and you get 161,500, divide by 2 again and you get 80,750. Now this may not seem easy, but once you've gotten used to it, dividing by four (or other low numbers) in that way becomes natural and takes only a fraction of a second. 80,750+323 = 81,073 , so you've got the answer with a minimum of effort compared to what you would otherwise have done. You can't always do it this easily, but it is always useful to look for the more obvious shortcuts in this style.
An even more effective way in some circumstances is to know a simple rule for a set of circumstances. There are a large number of rules which can be found, some of which are explained below.
====Factoring====
If you recognize that one or both numbers are easily divisible, this is one way to make the problem much easier. For example, 72 x 39 may seem daunting, but if taken as 8 x 9 x 3 x 13, it becomes much easier.
First, rearrange the numbers in the hardest to multiply order. In this case, I'd go with 13 x 8 x 9 x 3. Then multiply them one at a time. 
#13 x 8 = 10 x 8 + 3 x 8 = 80 + 24 = 104
#104 x 9 = 936
#936 x 3 = 2808 that would equal another number 
Which would equal up to a whole new
Faction
==== Multiplication by 11 ====
To multiply any 2-digit number by 11 we just put
the total of the two digits between the 2 figures.
for example: 27x11 can be written as [2][2+7][7]
Thus, 27x11=297
Another example: 33x11 can be written as [3][3+3][3]
Thus, 33x11=363. To visualise:
  330
 + 33
 ----
  363
Carry=overs:
77 x 11 = 847 
This involves a carry figure because 7 + 7 = 14
we get 77 x 11 = [7][14][7]. We add the 1 from 14 as carry over to 7 and get 77x11=847
Similarly,
84x11 can be written as [8][8+4][4]=[8][12][4]. The 1 from 12 carries over, giving 84x11=924
For 3 digit numbers multiplied by 11:
254 x 11 = 2794 
We put the 2 and the 4 at the ends.
We add the first pair 2 + 5 = 7.
and we add the last pair: 5 + 4 = 9.
So we can write 254 x 11 as [2][2+5][5+4][4]
i.e. 254x11=2794
Similarly, 909x11 can be written as [9][9+0][0+9][9] i.e. 909x11=9999
==== Multiplication by 99, 999, 9999,  etc  ====
To multiply a number A by 99, you can multiply A by 100 and then subtract A from the result.
When the number A is a two digit or one digit number, the result would be
(A - 1) following by (100 - A).  For example, when we multiply 65 by 99, we get
6435.
Similarly, to multiply a number A by 999, you can multiply A by 1000 and then subtract A from the result.
When the number A is a three digit, two digit or one digit number, the result would be
(A - 1) following by (1000 - A).  For example, when we multiply 611 by 999, we get
610389.
This same idea can be used for multiplication by any large number consisting only 9s.
====Same First Digit, Second Digits Add to 10====
Let's say you are multiplying two numbers, just two two-digit numbers for now (though the rules could be adapted for others) which start with the same digit and the sum of their unit digits is 10. For example, 87×83 (sum of unit digits: 7+3=10). You multiply the first digit by one more than itself (8×9 = 72). Then multiply the second digits together (7×3 = 21). Then stick the first answer at the start of the second to get the answer (7221). A simple proof of how this works is given in the Wikipedia article on [[w:Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha's Vedic mathematics#By one more than the one before|Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha's Vedic mathematics]].
If the result from the multiplication of the unit digits is less than 10, simply add a zero in front of the number (i.e., 9 becomes 09). For example, 59×51 is equal to [5×6][9×1] which equals [30][09]. Thus 59×51 = 3009.
==== Squaring a Number That Ends with 5 ====
This is a special case of the previous method.  Discard the 5, and multiply the remaining number by itself plus one.  Then tack on a 25 (which as in the previous section, is 5x5).  For example, 65x65.  Discarding the 5 from 65 leaves us with 6&lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt; = 6.  Multiplying 6 by itself plus one gives us 42 (6x7 = 42).  Tacking on a 25 yields 4225, so 65x65=4225.
For example, 45x45 can be written as [4x5][5x5]thus 45x45 = 2025
==== Squaring a two-digit number ====
Rather than doing 14&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 47&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as 14x14 or 47x47, the alternative is:
 14&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 = 10 x 1(14 + 4) + (4 x 4)
 = 10(18) + 16
 = 180 + 16
 = 196
In other words, add what's in the ones place to the number, multiply it by what was originally in the tens place (sometimes you'll get a sum with the next number up in the tens i.e. 47 + 7 = 54 so use 4 not 5 in this example) tack a zero at the end, then add the square of the ones place. So:
 47&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
 = 10 &amp;times; 4(47 + 7) + (7 &amp;times; 7)
 = 10 &amp;times; 4(54) + 49
 = 10 &amp;times; 216 + 49
 = 2160 + 49 = 2209
So now we know that 47&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 2209.
When squaring two digit numbers that are only 1 away from a number ending in zero you can also use the basic algebraic formulas (A^2)-(A-1)^2 = 2A-1 and (A+1)^2 - (A^2) = 2A + 1.  For example when squaring 99 you can set 100 as A then: that's not true because they explained it the wrong way 
100^2 = 10000
2 * 100 = 200
So the answer is (10000 - 200) + 1 = 9801
To square 91 use the second formula.  Then:
90^2 = 8100
2*90 = 180
So the answer is 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281
==== Squaring a number when you know the square of a number adjacent or in proximity ====
This is useful if you want to quickly calculate the square of a number when you know the square of the adjacent number.  For example, take the square of 46, using the &quot;5&quot; rule above you know that 45 squared is 2025.  Leverage this number and add 45+46 (91) to 2025, which equals 2116. While adding 91 to 2025 in your head isn't exactly easy, it is certainly easier than trying to calculate the square of 46 directly.  Doing this with an adjacent known square that is below is a bit more challenging depending on how you feel about doing subtraction in your head.  For subtraction, using 45 as our base, and trying to figure our what 44 squared is, we would take the known value of 2025 subtract 44 and 45 to get 1936.  This can be leveraged to try to determine squares that are not directly adjacent to the known square, but it gets a bit more complex (in your head!).  Symbolically: if b=a+1 and a and b are integers then b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+|a|+|b|.
====Just Over 100====
This trick works for two numbers that are just over 100, as long as the last two digits of both numbers multiplied together is less than 100. For example, for 103 x 124, 3 x 24 = 72 &lt; 100, so this trick will work. For 117 x 112, 17 x 12 = 204 &gt; 100, so it will not.
If the first test works, then the answer is:
:1[sum of last two digits][product of last two digits]
Examples:
*108 x 109 = 1[8+9][8x9] = 1[17][72] = 11,772
*105 x 115 = 1[5+15][5x15] = 1[20][75] = 12,075
*132 x 103 = 1[32+3][32x3] = 1[35][96] = 13,596
If the addition or multiplication of the last 2 digits &lt; 10, then add a 0 infront of the number, example if the addition is 4, it should be 04. Example shown below:
*102 x 103 = 1[2+3][2x3]=1[05][06]=10,506
This trick works for numbers just over 200, 300, 400, etc. with one simple change:
:[product of first digits][(sum of last two digits) x first digit][product of last two digits]
Examples:
*215 x 204 = [2x2][(15+4)x2][15x4] = [4][19x2][60] = [4][38][60] = 43,860
If the addition or multiplication of the last 2 digits &lt; 10, then add a 0 infront of the number, example if the addition is 4, it should be 04. Example shown below:
*201 x 202 = [2x2][(2+1)x2][2x1]=[4][06][02]= 4,0602
For numbers just over 1000, 2000, etc., use the following:
:[product of first digits]0[(sum of last two digits) x first digit]0[product of last two digits]
Examples:
*2008 x 2009 = [2x2]0[(8+9)x2]0[8x9] = [4]0[17x2]0[72] = [4]0[34]0[72] = 4,034072
***2008 x 2009 = 4,034,072
For each order of magnitude (x10), add two zeroes to the middle.

==== Just beneath 100 ====
This trick words for every number beneath 100, but is faster in the 90s.
For example, 96*98:

The answer will be a four-digit number,&lt;br /&gt;
[xx][xx].&lt;br /&gt;
For the last two digits, it is the product of the differences between 100 and the number for each multiplier. Take the first number 96. 100-96=4. Then take the second number 98. 100-98=2. 4x2=8. 8 is going to be our last two digits so 08.&lt;br /&gt;
[xx][08]&lt;br /&gt;
The first two digits is any number minus the difference between 100 and the other number. Let's take the first number 96 for example. The other multiplier is 98. 100-98=2. So take 2 away from 96. 96-2=94. You will get the same two digits if you pick any of the two numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
[94][08]. So the answer to the equation is 9408.

== Division ==
Again there are many possible techniques, but you can make do with the following or research your own. All numbers are the products of primes (you can make them by multiplying together prime numbers). If you are dividing you can divide by all the prime products of the number you are dividing by to get the answer. This means that 100/24 = (((100/2)/2)/2)/3. Although this means you have a lot more stages to do they are all much simpler. 100/2 = 50 , 50/2 = 25 , 25/2 = 12.5 , 12.5/3 = 4&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; = 4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.166666666recurring
Also, another helpful trick is, when you have to muliply and then divide by a number, always divide first, until you've reached numbers that are relatively prime, and then multiply.  This keeps numbers from being too large.  For example, if you must do (18 * 115)/15, it is much easier to divide 115 by 5 and 18 by 3, and then multiply them together to get 23 * 6 = 138.
=== Multiply by the Reciprocal===
Division is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal.  For instance, division by 5 is the same as multiplication by 0.2 (1/5=0.2).  To multiply by 0.2, simply double the number and then divide by 10.
===Division by 7===
The number 1/7 is a special number, equal to &lt;math&gt;0.\overline{142857}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that there are six digits that repeat, 142857.  A beautiful thing happens when we consider integer multiples of this number:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{7} = 0.\overline{142857}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{7} = 0.\overline{285714}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{7} = 0.\overline{428571}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{7} = 0.\overline{571428}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{7} = 0.\overline{714285}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{7} = 0.\overline{857142}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these six fractions of seven contain the same six digits repeating in the same order ad infinitum, but starting with a different number.  But how is this useful when dividing by seven?  Consider the problem 207/7.  First, we can convert this to 200/7 + 7/7.  We know that 7/7 equals one, so the answer will be 200/7 + 1.  But what is 200/7?  It is simply 2/7 times 100, and from the above, we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{7} = 0.\overline{285714}&lt;/math&gt;, so by moving the decimal point, we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{200}{7} =28.\overline{571428}&lt;/math&gt;.  All that remains is to add the one from 7/7, giving us &lt;math&gt;\frac{207}{7} =29.\overline{571428}&lt;/math&gt;.
===Division by 9===
The fraction 1/9 and its integer multiples are fairly straightforward - they are simply equal to a decimal point followed by the one-digit the numerator repeating to infinity:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9} = 0.\overline{11}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{9} = 0.\overline{22}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{9} = 0.\overline{33}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{9} = 0.\overline{44}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{9} = 0.\overline{55}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{9} = 0.\overline{66}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{9} = 0.\overline{77}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{8}{9} = 0.\overline{88}&lt;/math&gt;
To solve a problem such as 367/9, we reduce it to 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{367}{9} = \frac{300}{9} + \frac{60}{9} + \frac{7}{9}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{367}{9} = 33.\overline{33} + 6.\overline{66} + 0.\overline{77}&lt;/math&gt;
First add &lt;math&gt;33.\overline{33} + 6.\overline{66} = 40.0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then add &lt;math&gt;40.0 + 0.\overline{77} = 40.\overline{77}&lt;/math&gt;.
===Division by 11===
The fraction 1/11 and its integer multiples are fairly straightforward - they are simply equal to a decimal point followed by the product of nine and the the integer multiple repeating to infinity:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{11} = 0.\overline{09}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{11} = 0.\overline{18}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{11} = 0.\overline{27}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{11} = 0.\overline{36}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{11} = 0.\overline{45}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{11} = 0.\overline{54}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{11} = 0.\overline{63}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{8}{11} = 0.\overline{72}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{9}{11} = 0.\overline{81}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{10}{11} = 0.\overline{90}&lt;/math&gt;

== Roots ==
==== Cube Roots for under 1,000,000 ====
Before this goes any further, notice the last digit for the first nine cubes.
'''1''', '''8''', 2'''7''', 6'''4''', 12'''5''', 21'''6''', 34'''3''', 51'''2''', 72'''9'''

Notice how the last digit for each cube contains the numbers 1-9.

For each number, break it down into two groups. The last three digits and the remaining digits at the front. For the last three digits, find the cube root whose cube ends with the same number it ends with. That will be the last digit. For the front few digits, round it down to the previous cube and find the cube root of that. That will be the first digit.

Let's take &quot;148877&quot; for example. Divide it into 2 groups: 148, and 877. Start with 877. The number ends with a 7 and the number 3 is the only number that the cube ends with &quot;7&quot;. So the last digit must be 3.  

Look at 148. Round it down to the previous cube, which is 125. The cube root of 125 is 5, which is the first digit. Put it together, and 53 is the answer. 

This strategy will not work on cube roots that contain decimals, although it will give an approximate.

== Estimation ==
The best way to make estimation quickly in mental math is to round to one or two significant digits (that is, round it to the nearest place of the highest order(s) of magnitude), and then proceed with typical operations.  Thus, 1242 * 15645 is approximately equal to 1200 * 16000 = 19200000, which is reasonably close to the correct answer of 19431090.  In certain cases, one can even round to simply the nearest power of ten (which is useful when making estimations with much error and large numbers).
== Range Search ==
It is sometimes easier to make a calculation in the opposite direction from the one you want, and this can be used to quickly estimate the value you want.
Square root is a good example.  It is easier to square numbers than to take the square root.  So you take any number that will square to a little larger than the one you want, take another that squares to less than the one you want and use an average of the two.
The trick now is to apply a general technique ( the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method Bisection Method] ).
We create a new estimate using the average of our first two numbers.  Square this.  If it's value is higher than we want, we use it as the upper value of our range.  If it is lower than we want, we use it as the lower value of our range.
We now have a new range that must contain the square root we want.  We can apply the same process again to get a more accurate value ( this is known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration Iteration] ).
This technique is widely applied in computing, but also very handy for some mental mathematics.
== Other mental maths ==
Perhaps one of the more useful tricks to mental math is memorization.  Although it may seem an annoyance to need to memorize certain math facts, such as perfect squares and cubes (especially powers of two), prime factorizations of certain numbers, or the decimal equivalents of common fractions (such as 1/7 = .1428...).  Many are simple, such as 1/3 = .3333... and 2^5 = 32, but speed up your calculations enormously when you don't have to do the division or multiplication in your head.  For example, trying to figure out 1024/32 is much easier knowing that that is the same as 2^10/2^5, or which, subtracting exponents, gives 2^5, or 32.  Many of these are memorized simply by frequent use; so, the best way to get good is much practice.
It's a good idea to memorize 3 x 17 = 51.  We can extend this to 6 x 17 = 102.  If we round these numbers 3 x 17 is approx 50, 6 x 17 is approx 100, 9 x 17 is approx 150, and so on.  These are very helpful in estimating since 3, 6, 9, 50, 100 ... are common numbers.
== Advanced Mathematics ==
It is possible to make good estimates of quite complex formulae.  Range search is a useful technique and in addition to this you can also exploit some additional mathematical rules.
=== Binomial Expansion ===
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem Binomial Theorem] means we can relatively easily expand an equation like 
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 + x} = 1 + \textstyle \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{1}{16} x^3 - \frac{5}{128} x^4 + \dots\!&lt;/math&gt;
This is very useful if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1.  In that case the powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; get smaller and smaller, and
we can ignore them.
Even for whole numbers and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer Integers], this is useful as we can split the problem into a large and small number added and then raised to a power.  The small number's powers will become less important and we can neglect terms of the expansion than involve them to get a reasonable estimate.
So :
:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^4 \;=\; x^4 \,+\, 4 x^3y \,+\, 6 x^2 y^2 \,+\, 4 x y^3 \,+\, y^4.&lt;/math&gt;
If the value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; value is much smaller than the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we can make a good estimate, even if we don't add the &lt;math&gt;y^4,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;4 x y^3&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;6 x^2 y^2&lt;/math&gt; terms.

=== Compound Interest ===
The Binomial Theorem again comes to our help.  Here we usually want to work out :
:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n&lt;/math&gt;
::where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of interest (e.g. rate is 5% then &lt;math&gt;x = 0.05&lt;/math&gt; ) and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the period.
Using the theory we can roughly estimate this as
:&lt;math&gt;1 + n x + \frac{n (n-1)}{2} x^2&lt;/math&gt;
Although this is only a simple approximation it works quite well for small x.

A '''bean pot''' is a medium sized earthenware vessel in which [[Cookbook:Baked Beans|baked beans]] are customarily made.
The ingredients are combined in the bean pot and left in a warm or moderate [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Bake|bake]] for several hours, often four or more.

Modern bean pots come in a variety of colors and designs, but tradition holds that a bean pot should be two-tone brown, on cream.

Bean pots also vary widely in size, though two- and three-quart (2-3 L) pots are by far the most common. A one-quart (1 L) bean pot holds enough beans to feed two people sufficiently, while large families might find pots bigger than three quarts (3 L) to be excessive.

Although cooking baked beans in a bean pot is traditional, there is no reason that [[Cookbook:Beans|beans]] cannot be baked in any [[Cookbook:Bakeware|baking dish]] with a suitable cover. A [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]] is a well-suited replacement for a bean pot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Cooking Beans===

I recently added a section talking about an alternative cooking method and reasons why it may be superior to the traditional soaking method.
After writing it all, I realized that I don't have my sources handy and I felt uncomfortable about committing it, so I just commented it out and left it for another time.

My sources are several fold, though:

* Mark Bitman, in ''How to Cook Everything'', cites the overnight soak as unnecessary in terms of cooking time.
* John Thorne, in ''Pot on the Fire'', cites it as unnecessary in terms of
*# cooking time
*# flatulence (effect is negligible)
*# flavor (salting early doesn't toughen beans but makes them taste better)
* ''Cooks Illustrated'', in an article entitled '''Eliminating Gas from Beans''', did some lab analysis and found that very few of the fart inducing compounds are removed by soaking and only 20-40% are removed by repeated water changes as they cook.

Also, my own experience shows that all of that work isn't really necessary.  So, anyone have any objections to be adding this information?  I can dig my sources out of storage if it matters.
[[User:Crcarter|Crcarter]] 14:49, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

Removing 20% to 40% is pretty good I think. I wonder how long they cooked the beans though. I suggest 6 or more hours, and at least several water changes, in addition to the overnight soak. Your experience that &quot;all of that work isn't really necessary&quot; may reflect a simple lack of concern for farts or your luck in having low-gas gut bacteria. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:19, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

Well, I wouldn't say that 20-40% is ''pretty good'' so much as ''it's something'', especially as if you're talking about hours of extra work.
(I now ''must'' dig my sources out of storage to satisfy my curiosity.)
Is there policy on presenting different methods of preparing certain foods?
I would think it best to present the simplest and most straightforward method of preparation.
Other methods (eg, `Fart Reducing') could be presented as variations, especially since such methods may be prone to diminishing the flavor, texture or character of the food being prepared.

Fart apathy and above average gut-fauna diversity doesn't change the fact that I think the &quot;common knowledge&quot; that beans must be soaked (and require extensive cooking times) is unfounded.  Simple experience shows otherwise.
[[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 00:43, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

Well actually that brings to mind other benefits of long cooking times: you can get rid of the awful beany taste and make the beans easy to mash. Mashing the beans to make refried beans for a burrito is way easier after 6 hours of cooking. This isn't much work for the human. The human just needs to plan ahead. The stove does almost all the work. It's not a problem to have multiple cooking methods on this page as long as they all focus on the beans and don't turn into real recipes. If you start needing ingredient lists, make seperate pages. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:33, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

Right.  So, I'll -- at some point soon -- make a change to indicate these cooking techniques:
# Conventional: overnight soaking and simmering.
# Skip the soak, just simmer. (Mine, I guess.)
# Fart reduction: soak and extended simmer w/ water changes.

On our personal debate, though, I happen to like that &quot;awful beany taste&quot;.
Why would you eat beans if you don't like the way they taste?
I guess it's a matter of kitchen philosophy, but I generally try to prepare foods so as to preserve as much of their inherent character as possible.
Of course long cooking will make beans easier to mash, but this is a discussion of cooking beans in general, though, and not specifically about mashing them.
And your point about the work involved is just a matter of semantics.
Obviously the human isn't doing the work to generate the energy to cook the beans for six hours, but it still seems like an awful lot to invest if you just want to soften up some beans.
[[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 20:21, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Beans are cheap and nutritious, and they have the right texture for a burrito. Do you know a substitute? Perhaps butter with rice flour and powdered milk? That wouldn't be cheap though. Mushroom paste? Again, not cheap or even available. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:24, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

===Farts, Flatulence, Gastric Distress and Wording===
I think that &quot;flatulence&quot; sounds better, esp. in the section heading.
The next sentence has an unambiguous reference to &quot;farting&quot;.
I don't think that flatulence is any less clear than farting, and it sounds a bit less silly.
[[User:Crcarter|Clayton Carter]] 20:21, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Nothing sounds more silly than using a big long aristocratic word when a simple and common one will do. Come on, do people say &quot;oops, sorry I flatulated&quot;? Nobody I've ever known would use this word. Likewise, we don't use ''cranium'' all that much. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:53, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What area did they live in? ==
[[Image:Beginnings hist greece.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|The Beginnings of Historic Greece. 700 - 600 BC.]]
Ancient Greeks lived on the Balkan Peninsula (approximately at the territory of modern [[Wikijunior:Europe/Greece|Greece]]) and on the western part of Turkey.  They governed themselves from their cities, each of which had a separate government which governed over the countryside surrounding them.  There were quite a few of these city states, but their two greatest cities were Athens, in the north, and Sparta in the south.  The Greeks lived under their own rule until first being absorbed by the Macedonians, who lived to their north, and then finally the Roman Empire. Greece has many mountains and poor soil, which prevents many crops from being grown there. The country has a mild climate, which makes it convenient to farm goats and sheep. Also, Greece is a sea country: there are many beaches and islands, and no part of the country is far away from the sea. That made many of the Greeks sailors, and that meant that they sailed near and far, trading with different people, learning about other cultures, and bringing their own culture to faraway lands. These types of exchanges inspired development of Greek science and art.

== What did their structures look like? ==

Greek buildings were usually rectangular-shaped, surrounded by '''colonnades''' – rows of columns. Greece is rich in limestone, which was the most popular material of the time. Marble was more expensive, and was mostly used for statues and decoration. 

Greek theaters looked very much like modern ones, except that most were open to the weather. There were semi-circled rows of seats, each row was higher than the row in front of it, so that people in the back could see better. Centered in front of the audience was a circular '''orchestra''', where performances took place.  A low building called a '''skene''' sat behind the orchestra.  It was used to conceal actors, and gave room for costume changes, props and other &quot;backstage&quot; activity.

== What did they wear? ==
Greek men wore '''chitons''' – pieces of cloth pinned on one shoulder. Women wore '''peplos''' – long tube-shaped cloth, which was pinned on both shoulders and gathered around the waist. When it was cold, both men  and women wore a cloak, called '''clamys'''. Greeks wore sandals, which looked a lot like the sandals that we wear today.

== What did their writing look like? ==

[[Image:Stèle grecque1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Athenian decree from the 5th century BC]]

Greek writing looked a lot like Modern Greek text, written with capital letters. The Greek alphabet appeared in 8th century BC and was influenced by the Phoenician alphabet, the first alphabet that used signs for letters, not for words or syllables. Unlike the Phoenician alphabet, which did not have characters for vowels, the Greek alphabet had characters for all the sounds used in the language. In that sense it was the first modern alphabet, and the oldest to be used to this day. The Greek alphabet became a base for two other alphabets: Latin (that is used in English) and Cyrillic currently used in Slavic-speaking countries.

== What did they believe? ==

[[Image:Aphaia pediment 5 central Glyptothek Munich.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Athena]]

Greeks were '''polytheistic''', which means that they believed in many gods and goddesses. Each god or goddess was “responsible” for some side of life or natural phenomenon.

Twelve of the most important gods resided on mount Olympus. Their leader was Zeus, the god of the sky. Other Olympic gods were: his wife Hera - the goddess of marriage and motherhood, Poseidon – god of the sea, Aphrodite - the goddess of love, Apollo – the god of art and leader of muses - and Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, and the favorite daughter of Zeus.

[[Image:Kentaur Kreta asb 2004 PICT3436.jpg|thumbnail|240px|left|Centaur]]
Greeks believed in many mystical creatures other than gods: titans – children of Gaia, goddess of Earth, challenging Olympic gods; nymphs – nature spirits; muses – goddesses and patrons of art; centaurs – half humans, half horses; Cyclops – one eyed monsters; giants. 

In Greek myths, the Gods often had affairs with real people, and that’s how heroes, like Hercules – man of superhuman strength, who committed twelve labours, and Achilles – the hero of Trojan war, were born.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
[[Image:Homer.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Homer]]
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is '''Homer''', the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems '''Iliad''' and '''Odyssey'''. '''Sophocles''' and '''Aristophanes''' are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature. Another famous Greek is a mathematician '''Pythagoras''', mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles. '''Archimedes''' made many amazing inventions and discoveries. The legend says that he discovered Archimedes Principle while taking a bath, and got so excited, that he ran out naked into the street crying “Eureka!” – “I have found it!” The philosopher '''Socrates''' taught to question everything, separating beliefs from proven facts. He even questioned the existence of gods, which got him in trouble: he was accused of corrupting the youth and was sentenced to death by taking poison. Other great philosophers include '''Aristotle''' (the teacher of '''Alexander the Great''') and '''Plato'''. '''Alexander the Great''' is known for his conquest of the Middle East and Central Asia.

== What is left of them today? ==
The whole modern country of Greece! They still speak the same language, though it has changed some, use the same alphabet and preserve their heritage.

[[Image:Lincoln Memorial Close-Up.jpg|thumbnail|240px|left|The Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.]]
But Greek heritage is not limited to Greece only. It influenced Western culture greatly. That's why we call it the Cradle of Western Civilization. We use many Greek words in our everyday life, like democracy, philosophy, photography. In fact, the word ''alphabet'' comes from ''alpha'' and ''beta'', the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. In mathematics, one of the greatest discoveries they made was about right-angled triangles which is still important in map making. Greek philosophers strongly influenced ideas in the West for many years and their ideas are still important in politics, religion, government, discussion and argument, and in how people should behave toward one another and in society as a whole. Greek architecture and art strongly influenced Western architecture and art. (What does Lincoln Memorial remind you of?) The foundation of our science came from Ancient Greece. The Greek style of sculpture is still used all over the world today for statues of famous people. The Greeks also invented the theater and many of their plays are still acted all over the world today. Many of their stories and poems are also read widely today. The Greeks were the ones who started the Olympic Games, back in 776 BC, in honor of the god Zeus at the town of Olympia. Soon their fun side became more important and they were not just religious festivals anymore. Games were held every four years until AD 394 and were later restarted in 1896. The first of the new Olympics was held in Greece in honor of their original home and they have grown to become popular worldwide.

== Overview ==

Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, better known as '''''Nearly Headless Nick''''', is the resident ghost of Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. He was almost beheaded on October 31, 1492 but the axe was too dull and, despite hitting his neck forty-five times, did not entirely decapitate him, hence his nickname.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] first meet Nearly Headless Nick at the Arrival Feast. Ron recognizes him, and names him, from a description he got from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|his brothers Fred and George]]. Asked why &quot;'''''Nearly''''' Headless&quot;, Nick demonstrates that his head is held on only by a thin remnant. Nick also says that he hasn't eaten for nearly four hundred years.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Returning to the castle sodden and muddy after a Quidditch practice, Harry meets a dismayed-looking Nearly Headless Nick, who has received a rejection letter from the Headless Hunt. (&quot;Half an inch of skin and sinew!&quot;) After hearing Harry's worries about the upcoming Quidditch match against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Slytherin House|Slytherin]], Nick sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]], and warns Harry that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] is on the warpath. Harry tries to avoid him but is caught and taken to Filch's office, where Filch starts filling out a detention form for the &quot;crime&quot; of &quot;Befouling the castle&quot;. A crash from overhead distracts him, and sends him out of the office. On his return, Filch sees that Harry has become aware of some correspondence on his desk, and dismisses him hurriedly.

Outside Filch's office, Harry once again finds Nearly Headless Nick, who says that he had convinced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] to drop a heavy cabinet in the room over Filch's office to distract him, and is pleased that it had worked. He then invites Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to his Deathday Party, celebrating his death on 31 October 1492.

The Trio attend Nick's party, and find that it is a rather gloomy affair, with Peeves at one point chasing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]] away in tears. To put a quite unsatisfactory cap on the evening, as Nearly Headless Nick starts to make his speech thanking everyone for coming, the Headless Hunt bursts in through the walls and starts a wild game. Harry, Ron, and Hermione make their escape quietly in amongst the hullabaloo.

As they leave, Harry hears a voice. Following the voice, and with Ron and Hermione following him, he finds Mrs. Norris, Petrified and hanging from a torch bracket. Called upon to explain what they had been doing just before finding Mrs. Norris, the Trio explain that they had been attending Nick's Deathday party.

Shortly before Christmas, Harry finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] Petrified, and Nearly Headless Nick, black and smoky instead of his usual white color, and apparently also unconscious. Nearly Headless Nick is wafted up to the Infirmary by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ernie Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]] with a large fan, at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s orders.

With help from Hermione, despite her being Petrified, Harry and Ron discover that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. While this creature can kill with a glance, nobody has died yet because nobody has looked at it directly. In particular, Justin Finch-Fletchley had looked at it through Nearly Headless Nick; and Nick had not been killed by it because he was actually already dead.

Although we don't see him at the Ending Feast, we are led to believe that Nick is revived at the same time as the Petrified students.

&lt;!-- Note to editors: I'm leaving this section head here because I am certain Nick is mentioned in PoA, even though there is as yet no cross-reference to him. I have a re-read scheduled where I will note all that happens to a bunch of characters, I'll add Nick's PoA exploits at that time. --&gt;
While Nearly Headless Nick has no direct role in this book, he is mentioned in passing.

At the Arrival Feast, Nick informs Harry, Ron, and Hermione that there almost was not a feast this year. Peeves, upset at not being invited to the Feast, had gotten into the kitchen and had been wreaking havoc amongst the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House Elves]] making it. Hermione is astounded to learn that there are over a hundred House-Elves in Hogwarts, attending to the needs of the students. Saying that she will not benefit from slave labour, she pushes aside her plate and refuses to eat any more.

Nearly Headless Nick is already sitting at the Gryffindor table when the Trio and Neville arrive, and they sit near him. When the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]] sings its song, Ron asks if the Hat has ever given a warning before, Nick says certainly, but before he can complete his explanation he is interrupted by the start of the Sorting. Once the Sorting is complete, and food appears, Hermione asks him to continue his explanation. Nick says that whenever the Hat feels that the school is in danger, it warns that the school Houses must stand together in the face of the danger. Ron, despite the almost indecent glee with which he is stuffing his mouth, manages to ask how the Hat knows the school is in danger if it is a hat, and Nick points out that it does stay in the Headmasters' office, and likely hears what is passing there. At Harry's disbelief that he could ever join forces with Slytherin, Nick reproaches him, saying that the ghosts of the separate houses cooperate, that he would not, for instance, argue with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]]. At Ron's suggestion that Nick is scared of the Baron, Nick is highly affronted and leaves, settling further down the table beside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dennis Creevey|Dennis Creevey]].

As Harry heads to the Owlery to send a message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] on the Saturday following his first week of school, he encounters Nearly Headless Nick, who warns him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] is preparing a surprise for the next person who walks under the bust of Paracelsus. Harry confirms that this surprise involves the bust of Paracelsus falling on that person's head, then finds another way to the Owlery. Nick, meanwhile, heads off to look for the Bloody Baron, to see if he can put a stop to it.

After the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], Harry chooses to pack his trunk rather than attend the Leaving Feast. Restless, he leaves the dormitory to walk the halls. He sees Nearly Headless Nick passing through a wall ahead of him, and calls him over, saying he wants a word. Nick is reluctant, but says he rather expected this. They go into a vacant classroom, and Harry asks Nick if there is any chance that Sirius could have become a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]. Nick says that there is no chance. A certain amount of preparation is required, as well as unfinished business and a fear of death, and Sirius does not have any of that in sufficient quantity to make him want to stick around.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry returns to Gryffindor Tower following his retrieving the memory from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], he is denied entrance to the Common Room by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|the Fat Lady]]. While he is trying to decide what to do, Nearly Headless Nick wanders past. Harry tells him that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] had set him this task, and now he has to wait until Dumbledore is back. Nick remarks that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]] had said that Dumbledore had returned, but that he seemed tired. Nick suggests that Dumbledore is likely in his office.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry has become convinced that the last [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] that he must find and destroy is actually the lost Diadem of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] tells him that it has not been seen in living memory. It occurs to Harry that &quot;living memory&quot; only applies to the living and that the castle ghosts have been around far longer than that. Nearly Headless Nick is eager to help in any way that a ghost can, and is somewhat upset that Harry doesn't want his help, but rather the help of the Ravenclaw house ghost. Despite being upset, however, he does point [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Grey Lady|the Grey Lady]] out to Harry.

== Strengths ==
Being a ghost, he is already dead, and so he cannot die; even the Monster in the Chamber, who we find out later is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]], cannot kill him.

== Weaknesses ==

Being a ghost, he has limited ability to interact with the regular world. He is, however, affected by some artifacts of the material world; as mentioned, he cannot be killed by the Basilisk, but he is injured by it, being more or less Petrified by its gaze, and he is then transferred to the Hospital Wing by means of a large fan, indicating that he is affected by air currents. One wonders if this sensitivity to air currents (e.g. wind) is the reason so few ghosts are found outdoors.

Like Moaning Myrtle, Nick does not like being reminded that he is dead. While Myrtle's reaction is to burst into tears and run away, Nick instead tends to become affronted before ostentatiously distancing himself from the offender.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Nick as the Gryffindor house ghost, socializes with all Gryffindors. He seems to be particularly fond of Harry, though he is quite pleased to speak with either Ron or Hermione. He is somewhat easily offended by Ron's repeatedly mentioning that he is dead, and on at least one occasion moves away from Ron after such an event.

Nick has been trying for centuries to join one particular ghostly group, the Headless Hunt, but is hindered by his not being actually headless. 

== Analysis ==

In many ways, Nearly Headless Nick would seem to be almost a stereotypical 15th Century noble, believing in the birthrights of nobility and becoming affronted when his dignity is impugned. Against this, of course, we have to weigh the fact that we don't really know how 15th Century nobility actually acted. Would they have even deigned to speak with &quot;commoners&quot; like the students at Hogwarts? The average reader doesn't know, but may believe that the nobility of the day felt themselves innately immeasurably superior to those born without titles. The author has to make a choice between historical realism, and story, and we note that in this case, as in most, she has chosen the characterization that makes for the best story. A more realistic Sir Nicholas would likely have jarred fiercely against the expectations of the modern reader; but his portrayal in this series is sufficiently different from that of the students that it evokes the flavour of the age without jarring. Readers who don't believe that Sir Nicholas is portrayed accurately for his era may remind themselves that he has had five hundred years observing how styles have changed in Hogwarts, and presumably has been able to adapt himself to those styles somewhat, in order to avoid being effectively ostracized by the House which he inhabits.

The prime reason for Nearly Headless Nick's introduction would seem to be intimation that death is not final. Nick is the first ghost we meet in the series, and so is the first suggestion that in this series, some form of life after death is proven fact. We will learn from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] that a ghost &quot;is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth,&quot; while Nick [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|will say]] that &quot;Wizards can leave their imprint on the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod.&quot; We note the implication that the soul itself has departed, but the imprint of that soul remains, and suggest that a similar mechanism may [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|animate portraits]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Photograph|photographs]] in the Wizarding world. However, existence of the soul being a proven fact in the Wizarding world is undoubtedly meant as comfort for Harry, following the death of his parents, and presumably provides that comfort in at least some measure. Nick, in the first four books, is a concrete manifestation of existence of the soul, and so shows Harry, and the reader, that belief before we are told of it.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], as mentioned, we learn that Nick is not an actual soul, but instead is the imprint of a soul who has passed on. The author, in an interview, has stated that the books became more concerned with death after the death of her mother. It may well be that, in coming to terms with her mother's passing, the author decided that leaving one's entire soul shackled to one place, even if it was as large a place as the Earth, would be a fate worse than death, and so altered her description of ghosts, as enunciated first by Nearly Headless Nick, to indicate that the actual soul of the wizard had departed.

Two things about Nearly Headless Nick have given readers pause. 

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|the first book]], he tells Harry that he has not eaten in almost four hundred years; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 8|the second book]], he invites Harry to his five hundredth deathday celebration. As there is not a hundred-year gap in Harry's life at this point, we must assume that either Nick has miscounted, or that the author has made a small mistake. As it turns out, the author, in later editions, corrected the number in the first book to bring them both into line, changing &quot;almost four hundred years&quot; to &quot;almost five hundred years.&quot; As the date of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's death is given as 31 October 1492, this also pins the second book to the span July 1992 to June 1993.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|the second book]], Nearly Headless Nick is attacked by the monster from the Chamber and is left &quot;no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor.&quot; We will later find that a restorative draught based on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mandrake|mandrake root]] will revive all of those not fatally attacked by the Monster, but that does leave the question open: how does one administer a restorative draught to a ghost? This question is never fully answered, except perhaps by considering the dual meaning of the word &quot;draught.&quot; Given that possible pun, we can't help wondering if the author selected that term deliberately.

There is also, necessarily, some question of detail about Nick's death. We have to assume that the shape a ghost takes is the shape the body was in at the instant of actual death. At the risk of being gruesome, we note some reports from the time of the French Revolution that severed heads seemed to continue to react, albeit briefly, in a lifelike manner. So the Headless Hunt is made up entirely of members who were beheaded, and then died after their heads were severed. A headsman's axe is heavy, and even a club, applied with normal headsman's force to the neck, will shatter the spinal column and bring about death in short order; it's safe to assume that Nick will have died within a very few seconds after the first axe stroke. So if it did, in fact, take 45 strokes of the axe to behead him, all but the first few (possibly five) would have been posthumous. And it would be one of those first few than nearly severed his head.

== Who are Hebrews? ==
'''Hebrews''' were ancestors of Samaritans and Jews. They claim to be the descendants of the biblical Patriarch Abraham. They are known for their input into world culture, because their beliefs have influenced three major religions of the world. They are also known for their cultural and spiritual laws, rules, and morals. The Hebrews have influenced society today to a high degree.

== What country did they live in? ==
Hebrews were nomadic people. They lived in the ancient Middle East. Around 1400 BC they settled in '''Canaan''', the country on the eastern coast of Mediterranean sea, the territory of modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Later this country was known as the kingdom of Israel and, after the death of King Solomon, was divided into Israel and Judea.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
In the warm climate of the Middle East the house was not so important. Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.  Women did the cooking in the yard; stores were just open counters looking into the street.  Stone was used for building houses. There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.

When Hebrews were nomadic people, they lived in tents. But even when they settled, tents were very popular. Tents are often mentioned in the [[:w:Torah|Torah]], and even at the time of David and Solomon, living in a tent was common, especially for poor people.

Another option was living in a cave. The natural cave was enlarged and a wall was built in front, converting the cave into a sheltered home.

Wealthier people lived in the houses built of sun-dried mud bricks. The roofs of the houses were flat, so that people could stay outside in the cool evenings and sleep in summer. Domestic animals were kept on the first floor, together with people. There were no chimneys; smoke from cooking or heating fires escaped through the windows. The furniture was very simple. It included a few mats, spread upon the floor at night for sleeping, and rolled up during the day, or a kind of divan set against the wall; there were a table and chairs; a large jug for grain stood in the corner, and others for water, wine, oil, etc.; a niche in the wall held the lamp.

[[Image:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|Western Wall]]
But what made Hebrews really proud was the '''Jerusalem Temple'''. There were two temples built: the First Temple was built by King Solomon. Cedar wood for the construction was brought from Lebanon, and the walls and floor of the temple were covered with gold. The Ark of the Covenant was kept in the Holy of Holies, a room at the end of the temple. The first Temple was destroyed in 586 BC, when the Jews were exiled into the Babylonian Captivity.

After Jews returned from Captivity in 536 BC, they started building the Second Temple. This temple stood till AD 70, when it was destroyed by Romans. Another Temple was built and also destroyed. The only part that was left is from [[Herod's Temple]] and is the Outer Western Wall, a sacred site for Jewish people.  The Western Temple Mount wall is sometimes called the Wailing Wall and was believed to be from the second Temple and is often prayed near to, by the Jews today. This is also a &quot;Talmedic&quot; tradition.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

== What did they eat? ==
[[Image:2nd century Hebrew decalogue.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Second century Hebrew manuscript of Ten Commandments]]
Hebrew food was similar to the food of other Mediterranean people: they ate homemade bread that the lady of the house would bake in the big clay ovens in the yard, lentils, goat cheese, olives, and fresh fruits. Meat and fish were available. The most popular drink was wine.

But there was one difference about the food Hebrews ate: it had to be '''Kosher'''.  Kosher applied to all different types of food. It applied to meat which had to come from correctly slaughtered animals. These animals had to have split hooves and had to chew their cud. The fish they ate had to have fins and scales. The wine had to be made and supervised by a Hebrew at all times because other cultures would put blood in it to help it ferment and eating or drinking blood is not Kosher.
Some of the stricter Hebrews thought that meat should not be mixed with dairy, and that a person had to wait a few hours between having meat and dairy. This is a &quot;Talmudic&quot; tradition.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:PLATE4AX.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jewish noblemen in ancient Judah]]
Both men and women wore a tunic with a girdle, a robe on top of it, and a mantle (a sleeveless over garment) and a headdress. Men's and women's clothes were different in style and pattern. Women’s garments were longer, with long sleeves. 

Hebrew laws also had instructions about their clothing. They were supposed to wear tassels on the corners of their clothing, a commandment from the Bible. Their clothes were never a mix of wool and flax except for the high priest who was permitted to wear such a mixture. The priests also had special instructions about the clothing that they wore while they worked.

== What did their writing look like? ==
[[Image:Torah.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Torah Scroll]]
From very ancient times, the Hebrews began to write down their history, laws, and beliefs. The first five books or the '''Torah'''. The &quot;Torah&quot; was written in Hebrew. The books were written on large pieces of parchment and rolled into scrolls. These books were Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. 

Hebrew was and is written right-to-left, with consonants and vowel points. The Hebrew script evolved over the course of their history so ancient Hebrew writing does not look the same as it does today. Here is an example of what ancient Hebrew writing looked like:

[[Image:Omri.melek.israel.gif|200px]]

== What did they believe? ==
Hebrews were among the first people in the world whose religion was '''monotheistic'''. Monotheism is the belief that there is only one God. All of their neighbors were polytheistic: they believed in many gods and goddesses that looked and behaved like humans. The idea that there is a single God who cannot be seen and is present everywhere and knows everybody’s thoughts was very unusual at that time. YHWH, יהוה or Yahweh, pronounced Yah-way and translates to &quot;I Am&quot;, is the original Hebrew name of the Heavenly Father and the Jews believe saying his name is a forbidden. They use Adoni, pronounced Add-doe-nigh instead. He is also called El or Elohim in the Hebrew bible.

According to the ''Torah,'' the first person to start spreading the concept of one God was the patriarch Abraham. Monotheistic beliefs are currently found in many religions all over the world. 

The Hebrews believed that they were God's chosen people and that the Torah contained God's laws which must be followed.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
[[File:Moises.jpg|right|thumb|Michelangelo Buonarrotti. Moses]]
Many biblical heroes are known today.  The Bible became the most published book in the world, and, since so much of it was written about Hebrews, many Hebrew historical figures became famous. Many books, paintings and even movies are dedicated to them.

* '''Abraham''', '''Isaac''', and '''Jacob''' are the three patriarchs.

* '''Joseph''' - '''Jacob's''' second youngest son born to him in his old age. According to the Torah he was sold into slavery and ended up in Egypt, where he worked for Pharaoh. His most famous job was interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, which led to him saving Egypt having a famine while the rest of the world was having one. 
 
* '''Moses''' - Considered by many people to be one of the greatest leaders of Jewish people, and according to the Torah he is called the most humble man that ever lived. The most notable according to the Torah he took the Hebrews out of slavery from Egypt, God through him brought 10 plagues to Egypt, split the Red Sea, received the Torah along with the '''Ten Commandments''' and the oral Jewish law, set up the Jewish courts, took them to the land of Canaan - the land God promised to them through Abraham.

* '''King David''' - One of three kings of ancient Israel and ruler of the largest territorial extent of ancient Israel.  He was a significant military leader and lead the ancient Israelite armies in many successful battles.  He wrote most of the songs in the '''Book of Psalms'''.
 
* '''King Solomon''' - During his reign the kingdom of Israel reached its greatest prosperity, being one of the biggest powers in trade. He was known for his wisdom and justice. He also wrote songs in the '''Book of Psalms'''.

* '''Queen Esther''' -Or Hadassah, queen of Persia, according to the '''Esther''' she saved Jewish people from evil plans of Minister Haman to kill all Jews throughout the Persian Empire. This event is celebrated during the Jewish holiday of Purim.

[[File:Jesus_and_the_doctors_of_the_Faith_dsc01783.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Jesus speaking with Jewish teachers at age 12]]
*'''Jesus of Nazareth''' - Jesus is one of the most famous Hebrew of all. He was born in Bethlehem to Hebrew parents. He grew up in Nazareth, which is a part of Israel. He also became spiritual leader and many of his early followers were also Hebrew and are still famous today, such as the apostles Paul, Peter and John. Jesus of Nazareth is commonly known as Jesus Christ which is the name his followers chose after his death. Christos in Ancient Greek means anointed one.

== What is left of them today? == 
Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Assyrians in 722 BC. Judea lost its independence to Rome in the first century AD. Jews had to leave their country. For two thousand years they lived all over the world, preserving their religion, language and traditions. They survived through centuries of discrimination and prejudice and through the extermination of one third of the Jewish population of the world in the Second World War. In 1948 the state of Israel was established again.

Hi, my name is Graeme McRae. I have always been a stickler for proper word usage and grammar, and this makes me annoyed at articles with clumsy wording or dumb mistakes of any kind. With Wikipedia, I can channel that frustration into positive action to polish the &quot;surface&quot; of the articles at the same time I learn from the underlying content.&amp;nbsp;  ([[Special:Contributions/GraemeMcRae|My contributions]])&amp;nbsp; ([http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgi-bin/count_edits?user=GraemeMcRae&amp;dbname=enwiki My Edit Count Stats])&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have a [http://mcraeclan.com/Graeme personal webpage] that I use kind of as a blog, for ranting about (or appreciating) various things, and a [http://mcraefamily.com/MathHelp math page] that I use for describing some very cool things about math, in a way that might help people understand them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you would like to leave me a message, edit my [[User Talk:GraemeMcRae|User Talk]] page, and put your comment at the bottom.  I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Constructing a Complex Derivation =

== An example derivation ==

Subderivations can be nested.  For an example, we provide a derivation for the argument

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{T},\ \ \mathrm{S} \land \lnot \mathrm{T},\ \ \mathrm{S} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We begin with the premises and then assume the antecedent of the conclusion.

Note. Each time we begin a new subderivation and enter a temporary assumption, there is a specific formula we are hoping to derive when it comes time to end the derivation and discharge the assumption.  To make things easier to follow, we will add this formula to the annotation of the assumption.  That formula will not officially be part of the annotation and does not affect the correctness of the derivation.  Instead, it will serve as an informal reminder to ourselves noting where we are going.

This starts a subderivation to derive the argument's conclusion.  Now we will try a Disjunction Elimination (DE) to derive its consequent:

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


This will require the showing two conditionals we need for the antecedent lines of a DE, namely:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


We begin with the first of these conditionals.

|- style=&quot;height:10px&quot;

This subderivation is easily finished.

Now we are ready to discharge the two assumptions at Lines 5 and 6.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;

Now it's time for the second conditional needed for our DE planned back at Line 4.  We begin.

Note that we have a contradiction between Lines 12 and 15.  But line 12 is in the wrong place.  We need it in the same subderivation as Line 15.  A silly trick at Lines 16 and 17 below will accomplish that.  Then the assumptions at Lines 12 and 13 can be discharged.

Finally, with Lines 4, 11, and 19, we can perform the DE we've been wanting since Line 4.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 4, 11, 19 DE
|-
|}
|}


Now to finish the derivation by discharging the assumption at Line 4.

''Sociology systematically studies how groups of people are affected differently by human behavior patterns. A deeper understanding of how people make sense of their lives and act to create, maintain, and change the world around them accordingly can aid us in improving our own lives and the lives of others.'' This is but one short summary of what some people (&quot;process&quot; sociologists particularly) believe the essence of sociology to be.... there are many other different and sometimes rivaling conceptualizations.

==Introduction==
This is an open source curricular module, not a &quot;course&quot; in the traditional sense.  There are no schedules, due dates, or tests as would be found in traditional higher education settings.  Since there are no real &quot;correct&quot; answers for students to [re]produce, there is no one hallowed book of knowledge to be had here.  Instead, what this medium offers is the promise of effectively compiling and organizing virtually unlimited information resources from which users can pick and choose from as they see fit or their situation demands.  What may be lost via lack of corporeality, temporality, and formality in the way of grades and credits can be made up for in the expansive potential for discovery based learning in such a novel context.  I hope this space will develop into a repository for a multiplicity of perspectives and intellectual exercises built for people looking for interesting and diverse segways into the study of human societies.  To begin, I have made my uncopyrighted materials for the course I teach at the University of Florida available here and hope that other educators, interested parties, and diligent students will soon add on to this scaffolding.  Perhaps the &quot;experts&quot; who come forth to contribute to this project will also make themselves available to answer questions that truly inquiring minds must produce.  This model should foster an enlarged body of engaged participants that become invested in adding onto and improving this forum exponentially, as is the greatest promise and observed tendency of wikis everywere.

==Textbook==
Our textbook, should you choose to accept it, is a [[/Introduction to Sociology|Introduction to Sociology]] open source ebook. The topics below correspond to the organization found in this text.  

==Activities==
The weakest link in this format is its lack of structure or accountability.  Utilizing the information optimally will likely be difficult for most folks who just drop in and browse around at will.  Instead, I would suggest that students follow the material in a somewhat linear manner, at least until (hopefully) the topics below become so diversified that this path becomes unwieldy.  Please, fret not that the lack of testing of your reading comprehension via multiple choice assesments means that you will not really &quot;learn&quot; anything, for there exists a superior pedagogical strategy that is uniquely facilitated by open source wikis such as this one.  The key to really &quot;getting&quot; this stuff is to &quot;make it your own&quot; by criticizing it and creatively expanding on it.  This means that you should actively try to edit all the materials you encounter.  Now, arbitrary and/or uninformed changes are not the goal here - instead, you should spend a significant amount of time wrestling intellectually with the ideas and exploring the issues and concepts on wikipedia that relate to the particular discussion topic at hand.  The discussion space for each subtopical article is the perfect place to start broaching ideas for substansive changes, but you can also use the email contacts below.  The main idea here is that the level of learning you achieve through this activity will be directly proportionate to the amount of time and effort you expend trying to contribute to the materials via attempting to improve them.  In fact, a diligent student could make big contributions by simply linking the somewhat obscure terms found throughout the texts to wikipedia articles.  More in depth work would include stepping beyond existing materials and developing new discussions of interesting and relevant subject matters.  A full assimilation of the knowledge found herein is best achieved by utilizing it in a wholly new context, that is, by writing new articles, hopefully suplemented by outside information sources and multimedia of all kinds.

'''Sociological Visions of Ethics and Responsibility drawn from ideas featured in Conversations with Zygmunt Bauman'''

''In this world there is beauty and there are the humiliated… whatever difficulties this situation may present we should all strive to never be unfaithful to either.'' – Albert Camus

As a general rule, in any society at any given time, there is more humiliation and misery occurring than society notices, more still than it admits, and much more still than it resolves to alleviate or rectify. This is the prime reason why justice is always a distant cry , far ahead and out of reach from everything we do for human well-being and dignity. However, we can't be faithful to the humiliated unless we at least reach for beauty.

Social thought is done for the benefit of humanity when it shows us how we can refuse to act in systematically hurtful ways even while living under circumstances that make the cruel treatment of others seem easy to accept. As relatively free beings, it is possible to choose to care a little more. In that choice lies our human dignity and our sense of morality. The role of critical sociology is to make these choices more accessible by demonstrating that our currently socially acceptable ways of thinking and acting are based on historically isolated and likely flawed sets of social ethics .

Sociologists are not unrealistic utopians who think they know how to finally set the world right to insure that all people live eternally in peace and harmony. This can be rejected on the grounds that the practice of sociology is implicitly tied to the values of the particular culture that surrounds it – those which likewise bind all men and women in the community of social thinkers. However, sociology is an important agent in re-imagining and redoing the current world. It is hoped that this deprives the prevailing institutions of the day the air of invulnerability they desperately need to continue to operate unopposed. What sociology badly needs to fulfill its mandate is an enlarged public forum in which people can come together to recreate their world first in ideas, without the fear that all our hopes and ambitions will be overshadowed by the public desire to make a spectacle out of private lives. It is this forum that our society conspicuously and disastrously lacks and needs to revitalize politics, especially in this time of greatest need.

The effort to give some social choices preference over other alternatives is what we call “ethics”. Society is an ongoing effort to increase the probability of some choices occurring over others. Thus, sociology cannot but be inquiry into the ways in which ethical rules are constructed . Societies are systems of coordinated choices and any society you study is but one reality chosen among many . Society may be “good” or “bad” depending on different beliefs, but in each case it may be better than it is. Being moral means accepting that new choices may be good or may be bad, but it does not mean knowing, let alone knowing for sure which are good and which are bad. Being moral means being bound to make such new choices under conditions of acute and painful uncertainty. To be moral means never to feel good enough about our choices or about the current state of our world – this is the restlessness associated with being human.

Often ethics comes in handy as a tranquilizer, as a drug to mitigate pangs of conscience. However, becoming dependent on the same tired old ethics of justification may in the long run destroy our moral immune system and deprive the self of the little ability it might have had in facing up to tough moral dilemmas and going after the good on its own volition. This restless and indefatigable search for ways to do away with the wrongs of our world never runs a straight line since new actions bring with them new evils . History has been more like a pendulum that a straight edge ruler. To defend ourselves from the evils perpetrated in the past, we march with our backs turned toward the future, but no sooner do we turn to scrutinize the future than it becomes in its turn a past with ugliness showing anew.

Modernity has often been about making the world a “clean” and predictable place. Ordering the world in such a preplanned fashion means making reality vastly different than it currently is by getting rid of the ingredients of reality which are deemed to be responsible for the impurity of the certain human conditions. On this path, we may quickly arrive at a verdict that some people should be refused help, thrown out, or destroyed in the name of a greater good and someone else's greater happiness. Would we be better or worse off without the modern ethos? No one really knows… we still need to wait for full inventory to be made of the atrocities which it may have blinded us to thus far. Modernity's forte is the power of its tools. What counts in the measurements of its success are efficiency, speed, and the scale of performance. Its weakness is the vagueness and uncertainty about the ends to which these tools may be applied. There is a fast growing imbalance between the means we (as members of the privileged lot of humanity) have at our disposal and the ends which we collectively can agree on as worthy of our attention and effort.

If you think you know exactly what the good society is like, then any cruelty you commit in its name is justified and absolved. We can abstain from self-assured acts of cruelty only when we are unsure of our wisdom and admit the possibility of our own ideological fallibility. The ghastly failure of our utopias has turned peoples' thoughts away from what a better life would require to be done in the here and now. It seems that societies manipulate morality rather than produce it. Powerful groups enforce the kinds of morality that advance their own interests. It is this socially produced reality which needs to justify itself, to be tried and judged at the tribunal of ethics.

Freedom may be the natural condition of humanity, but most of human history has been dedicated to repression. S ecuring bare necessities for all people is the secret to releasing humanity's amazing creative potential. In these times of “liquid modernity”, the hoops one must jump through to achieve security are notorious for being melted as soon as they are molded. For too many, there are only motel beds and sleeping bags available for readjustment. We are told daily that our possibilities are unlimited and that we need only pick and choose those that fit us best. We are then punished for failing to find the best of these advertised alternatives, as if what we had been told of their availability had some guarantee attached. This myth cannot become true for more people as long as the present-day decoupling of freedom and security persists. These two values cannot be entertained separately.

We are encouraged to believe that security is in fact disabling, responsible for breeding the kind of dependency that is thought to constrain human freedom. However, acrobatics and tight rope walking without a [social] safety net is an art few people can master and recipe for disaster for all the rest. Take away security and freedom is the first casualty. Most modern atrocities have been byproducts of a desperate search for security. As older unchanging and self-reproducing orders collapsed under the changes of modernity, quelling the fears brought on by this disturbance was brought to obsessive extremes by modernity, which allowed ever more desperate and destructive responses

Freedom is the uppermost among human values but first and foremost it is a fate. Free beings, if they are indeed free, may embrace that fate or try to escape it, make it into their vocation or fight against it: this is also the capacity to which they owe their freedom. Often freedom seems to be an ambivalent value because it sometimes attracts and repels at the same time. It is disconcerting and frightening to account for one's actions using the terms “I had to” instead of “I wanted to”. Hence the treacherous allure of “there is no alternative” ideologies as well as many of the awesome seductive powers of totalitarian regimes. Remember, there is never a shortage of offers to absolve us of our freedoms .

By itself, the idea of justice has no specific meaning. It only makes sense as a protest against injustice. A just society is a society which considers itself not just enough, which questions the sufficiency of any achieved level of justice and considers justice always to be a step more ahead. A just society is one which reacts angrily to any case of injustice and promptly sets about correcting it. While modernity has blurred many traditional distinctions between justice and injustice, its promise is provide more information on which to base our judgments. Today, the concept of injustice is more hotly contested than any other time in history. However, fast-paced change in the structure and content of our lives has made the idea of justice hazier than ever before. Since justice can only be described as an ever changing ideal, the just society must seek it through ongoing controversy, not majority rule consensus. Like modernity, justice is not just an unfinished project, it is an unfinishible project with only a very limited conception of future directions.

What is more noticeable these days is the tendency to ignore or brush off some of the world's most brutal and excessive differences in standards of living (caused both by particularities in human history and by the current economic regime) as “facts of nature” about which we collectively can do nothing but humbly accept and obey. This happens while the moral alertness of the public is redirected to focus on the demands for recognition from small groups and categories of people sufficiently free and resourceful enough to choose a new lifestyle and demanded its acceptance.

The increasing global effects of our local actions necessitate responsibility on a scale which has never been confronted before. Global power demands global responsibility. The latter has been much slower to arrive even as it finds itself increasingly impotent in the face of consolidated transnational corporate power. The fraction of our income or gross domestic product we are prepared to share with faraway impoverished people who are deprived of livelihood partly as a result of our economy's global search for wealth is pitifully tiny. Investing in the poor may be a morally correct act, but it makes no economic sense under capitalism – less money in wealthy consumers' pockets only raises prices.The problem of finding ways to catch up with rapidly globalizing economic powers by means of our local and national institutions of democracy may presently constitute the major challenge to our standards of justice and morality.

There is a contemporary feeling amongst individuals even in the most free and affluent societies that some of the most basic and important patterns of their lives simply cannot be changed and concern with these problems will only be a waste of time. This is because for the most part the roots of whatever troubles us most and stands in the way of a dignified and morally satisfied life are stuck well beyond the reach of our individual action. These roots are socially planted and cultivated and only collectively can they be dug up and detoxified . Once set in motion, individualization is a self-propelling and self-intensifying process. One of its foremost effects is the undermining of the possibility to act socially to question society and then following this critique with a shared strategy. It is the task of sociology to reconstitute society as the common property and responsibility of free individuals aiming at a dignified life.

With the world changing faster every day, levels of anxiety and isolation continue to rise as individuals and families attempt to cope alone – resulting in very negative consequences for some. With the almost forgotten ties of the extended family out of reach in times of need and insecurity, many people long for a community they can no longer locate. We cannot help missing the missing community but the community we miss cannot be found. Most disconcerting to today's consumer masses is that it cannot be commissioned or made on demand. A true community must be able to address serious crises collectively, but also secure stable and productive lives for its individual members. Like cultures, true communities are not as much impositions of fixed identities as they are processes of making sense with and through others. Our culture should be a knife pressed against the future…

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Expelliarmus''''' spell is the Disarming spell; it knocks the victim's weapon out of his/her hands. When it is performed with more power, &lt;!--or if the victim is unarmed,--&gt; one can blast the opponent off their feet.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see this spell first used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|the Dueling Club]]; Snape casts it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]], disarming him and throwing him to the end of the platform on which they are demonstrating. Later in the same book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] casts the same spell on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], causing the book that he is holding, Riddle's diary, to fly out of his hand. From this point on, it is used quite often when there is a duel between wizards; if you can get your opponent to lose his wand, you do have a great advantage over him. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] warns Harry about the use of this spell, as it is being recognized as Harry's signature spell, and suggesting that he use more powerful defensive magic.

== Analysis ==

As mentioned, at one point Harry does use this spell to get someone to drop a book; as the diary is obviously not a weapon, we can see that this spell will act on anything that is held in the hand, not just a weapon or wand. It's possible that there is a mental part of this spell as well, envisioning the specific object that you want to have it act on; alternately, it could work on whatever you are pointing your wand at. In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] all cast this spell at the same time, and it not only pulls Snape's wand out of his hand, but also throws him against the wall. This leads us to believe that the power of the spell is additive when cast by multiple wizards on the same object.

Despite the fact that the charm can do things other than disarm, its main function is to get an attacker to drop his wand; as such, it is referred to as the Disarming spell.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# In the seventh book, it appears that this is taken to be Harry's &quot;signature spell&quot;. Why would that be?
# In the seventh book, we learn that there can be other effects from the use of this spell. What would those be?

Starting with version 2.3, Python comes with an implementation of the mathematical set. Initially this implementation had to be imported from the standard module &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt;, but with Python 2.6 the types set and [[#frozenset|frozenset]] became built-in types. A set is an unordered collection of objects, unlike sequence objects such as lists and tuples, in which each element is indexed. Sets cannot have duplicate members - a given object appears in a set 0 or 1 times. All members of a set have to be hashable, just like dictionary keys. Integers, floating point numbers, tuples, and strings are hashable; dictionaries, lists, and other sets (except frozensets) are not.

===Overview===
Sets in Python at a glance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
set1 = set()                   # A new empty set
set1.add(&quot;cat&quot;)                # Add a single member
set1.update([&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;])  # Add several members
if &quot;cat&quot; in set1:              # Membership test
  set1.remove(&quot;cat&quot;)
#set1.remove(&quot;elephant&quot;) - throws an error
print set1
for item in set1:              # Iteration AKA for each element
  print item
print &quot;Item count:&quot;, len(set1) # Length AKA size AKA item count
isempty = len(set1) == 0       # Test for emptiness
set1 = set([&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;])     # Initialize set from a list
set2 = set([&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;])
set3 = set1 &amp; set2             # Intersection
set4 = set1 | set2             # Union
set5 = set1 - set3             # Set difference
set6 = set1 ^ set2             # Symmetric difference
issubset = set1 &lt;= set2        # Subset test
issuperset = set1 &gt;= set2      # Superset test
set7 = set1.copy()             # A shallow copy
set7.remove(&quot;cat&quot;)
set8 = set1.copy()
set8.clear()                   # Clear AKA empty AKA erase
print set1, set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7, set8, issubset, issuperset
&lt;/source&gt;

===Constructing Sets===

One way to construct sets is by passing any sequential object to the &quot;set&quot; constructor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; set([0, 1, 2, 3])
set([0, 1, 2, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(&quot;obtuse&quot;)
set(['b', 'e', 'o', 's', 'u', 't'])
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also add elements to sets one by one, using the &quot;add&quot; function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set([12, 26, 54])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.add(32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([32, 26, 12, 54])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that since a set does not contain duplicate elements, if we add one of the members of s to s again, the add function will have no effect.  This same behavior occurs in the &quot;update&quot; function, which adds a group of elements to a set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.update([26, 12, 9, 14])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([32, 9, 12, 14, 54, 26])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you can give any type of sequential structure, or even another set, to the update function, regardless of what structure was used to initialize the set.

The set function also provides a copy constructor.  However, remember that the copy constructor will copy the set, but not the individual elements.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = s.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2
set([32, 9, 12, 14, 54, 26])
&lt;/source&gt;

===Membership Testing===

We can check if an object is in the set using the same &quot;in&quot; operator as with sequential data types.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 32 in s
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 in s
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 not in s
True
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also test the membership of entire sets.  Given two sets &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;, we check if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[w:Subset|subset]] or a superset of &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.issubset(set([32, 8, 9, 12, 14, -4, 54, 26, 19]))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.issuperset(set([9, 12]))
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &quot;issubset&quot; and &quot;issuperset&quot; can also accept sequential data types as arguments

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.issuperset([32, 9])
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the &lt;= and &gt;= operators also express the issubset and issuperset functions respectively.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; set([4, 5, 7]) &lt;= set([4, 5, 7, 9])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; set([9, 12, 15]) &gt;= set([9, 12])
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Like lists, tuples, and string, we can use the &quot;len&quot; function to find the number of items in a set.

===Removing Items===

There are three functions which remove individual items from a set, called pop, remove, and discard.  The first, pop, simply removes an item from the set.  Note that there is no defined behavior as to which element it chooses to remove.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set([1,2,3,4,5,6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.pop()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([2,3,4,5,6])
&lt;/source&gt;

We also have the &quot;remove&quot; function to remove a specified element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.remove(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([2,4,5,6])
&lt;/source&gt;

However, removing a item which isn't in the set causes an error.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.remove(9)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
KeyError: 9
&lt;/source&gt;

If you wish to avoid this error, use &quot;discard.&quot;  It has the same functionality as remove, but will simply do nothing if the element isn't in the set

We also have another operation for removing elements from a set, clear, which simply removes all elements from the set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.clear()
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
set([])
&lt;/source&gt;

===Iteration Over Sets===

We can also have a loop move over each of the items in a set.  However, since sets are unordered, it is undefined which order the iteration will follow.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set(&quot;blerg&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in s:
...     print n,
...
r b e l g
&lt;/source&gt;

===Set Operations===

Python allows us to perform all the standard mathematical set operations, using members of set.  Note that each of these set operations has several forms.  One of these forms, s1.function(s2) will return another set which is created by &quot;function&quot; applied to &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The other form, s1.function_update(s2), will change &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to be the set created by &quot;function&quot; of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, some functions have equivalent special operators.  For example, s1 &amp; s2 is equivalent to s1.intersection(s2)

====Intersection====

Any element which is in both &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; will appear in their [[w:intersection_(set_theory)|intersection]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.intersection(s2)
set([6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 &amp; s2
set([6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.intersection_update(s2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([6])
&lt;/source&gt;

====Union====

The [[w:union_(set_theory)|union]] is the merger of two sets.  Any element in &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; will appear in their union.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.union(s2)
set([1, 4, 6, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 | s2
set([1, 4, 6, 8, 9])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that union's update function is simply &quot;update&quot; [[#Constructing_Sets|above]].

====Symmetric Difference====

The [[w:symmetric_difference|symmetric difference]] of two sets is the set of elements which are in one of either set, but not in both.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
set([8, 1, 4, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 ^ s2
set([8, 1, 4, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.symmetric_difference_update(s2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([8, 1, 4, 9])
&lt;/source&gt;

====Set Difference====

Python can also find the [[w:Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_Complement|set difference]] of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is the elements that are in &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; but not in &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([4, 6, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([1, 6, 8])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.difference(s2)
set([9, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 - s2
set([9, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.difference_update(s2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1
set([9, 4])
&lt;/source&gt;

===Multiple sets===
Starting with Python 2.6, &quot;union&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, and &quot;difference&quot; can work with multiple input by using the set constructor. For example, using &quot;set.intersection()&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = set([3, 6, 7, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = set([6, 7, 9, 10])
&gt;&gt;&gt; s3 = set([7, 9, 10, 11])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set.intersection(s1, s2, s3)
set([9, 7])
&lt;/source&gt;

===frozenset===
A frozenset is basically the same as a set, except that it is immutable - once it is created, its members cannot be changed.

“I thought Adorno, on our first meeting, the most arrogant, self-indulgent (intellectually and culturally) man I have ever met. Some 20 years later, I can think of additional claimants for that position, but I doubt if they are serious rivals” (Donald MacRae, cited in Morrison, 1978, pp. 331-332). 

The [[w:Frankfurt School|Frankfurt School]] was a group of critical theorists associated with the Institut für Sozialforschung (Institute of Social Research) which was located first at the [[w:Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] (1923-1933), then in Geneva, Switzerland (1933-35), [[w:Columbia University|Columbia University]] in New York (1935-1949), and finally back at the University of Frankfurt, from 1949 to present.  Some of the theorists associated with what became known as the Frankfurt School included Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno (née Wiesengrund), [w:Herbert Marcuse], Walter Benjamin, Erich Fromm, Leo Lowenthal, and Friedrich Pollock.  

Felix Weil began the Institute of Social Research in 1923.  The theoretical basis of the Institute was Marxist, to no small degree because of Carl Grünberg, who served as director from 1923-1930.  Max Horkheimer succeeded Grünberg as director and served in that capacity until 1960, when Theodor Adorno became director, until his death in 1969.  These theorists were all associated with the Institute in the 1920s, except for Marcuse, who began working with the Institute in 1932.  From the late 1950s Jürgen Habermas would be involved with the Institute, but for a number of reasons his work is often considered separate from that of the Frankfurt School.  The Institute for Social Research continues to operate at the University of Frankfurt, but what is known as the Frankfurt School did not extend beyond the  theorists associated with it.  

The interests of the Frankfurt School theorists in the 1920s and 1930s lay predominantly in a Marxist analysis of social and economic processes, and the role of the individual and the group in relation to these processes.  Their particular relevance to communication theory lies primarily in Adorno's idea of the culture industry, and Marcuse's concept of the &quot;one dimensional&quot; man.

== The Culture Industry ==

In 1947 [[w:Horkheimer|Max Horkheimer]] and Theodor Adorno published ''Dialektik der Aufklärung: Philosophische Fragmente'', whose title was translated into English (in 1972) as ''Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments''.  One of the sections of this book was concerned with what Horkheimer and Adorno called the culture industry.  It was their contention that the culture industry was the result of an historical process that with an increase in technology (including mass communication technology) there was an increase in the ability to produce commodities, which enabled increased consumption of goods.  The consumption of mechanically reproduced cultural products—predominantly radio and film—led to formulas of producing them for entertainment purposes, and it did not occur to consumers to question the idea that the entertainment presented to them had an ideological purpose or purposes.  Consumers adapted their needs around these cultural products, and in doing so no longer knew of anything else that they might desire, or that there might be anything else they could desire.  The entertainment that they enjoyed did not reflect their real social, political, or economic interests, but instead blinded them from questioning the prevailing system.  Entertainment also had the function of allowing the dominant system to replicate itself, which allowed for further expansion in production and consumption.  Thus, for Adorno and Horkheimer the culture industry worked in such a way that those who were under its influence would not even notice that they were being manipulated.

Subsequent to the book’s publication in 1947, theorists of the Frankfurt School knew of Adorno's concept of the culture industry, but the impact of his analysis of the culture industry was limited well into the sixties.  ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' did not receive a wider distribution until 1969, and although Herbert Marcuse continued the general idea of the culture industry in his ''One-Dimensional Man'' of 1964, he did not refer to it as such.  In spite of Marcuse’s incisive criticism of dominant ideological structures, there is not a cultural component in his thought that can be separated out from ideology as a whole, as appears in the work of Adorno and Horkheimer.  Thus, as a concept relating to communication theory in the United States, the culture industry can more properly be said to have come to existence due to the English translation of Adorno and Horkheimer’s book in 1972.

== Genesis of “The Culture Industry” ==

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact.  The idea of the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical reproduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood movies.  That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Theordor Wiesengrund enrolled at the University of Frankfurt in 1921 not only to study philosophy, but music.  Wiesengrund published in the 1920s and early 1930s under the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno, and later took the name Adorno, which had been his mother’s maiden name.  According to Thomas Mann, Adorno refused to choose between music and philosophy throughout his entire life, believing that he was pursuing the same objective in two disparate fields (Jäger, 2004, p. 31).  Although he wrote his doctoral thesis on Husserl, and a postdoctoral thesis on Kierkegaard, Adorno moved to Vienna to study music composition with Alban Berg. Most of Adorno's music was written between 1925 and 1930, though he continued to compose music for the rest of his life.  In addition to composing, Adorno was a music critic and editor of ''Musikblatter des Anbruch'' from 1928 to 1932.  As a composer and music critic Adorno was aware of conditions relating to the production and dissemination of music in the 1920s and 1930s.  This aspect of Adorno’s career is important in understanding his subsequent approach to culture. Because he had a profound knowledge of art, which is great part of culture, his belief what the real art should be like influenced on his criticism against culture industry. To Adorno, the gist of real art is autonomy. Both of the production and the consumption of cultural product should be originated by autonomy which arouses uniqueness of real art. According to Adorno, culture industry which products and consumes the mass cultural product is not based on autonomy but passivity so that it never seeks for uniqueness of real art or culture. 

Adorno was introduced to [[w:Walter Benjamin|Walter Benjamin]] in 1923, and the two theorists became friends.  Since Benjamin never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno became in effect Benjamin's only pupil.  After Benjamin’s death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rationalized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jäger, 2004, p. 65-6).  The relationship with Benjamin had an impact on the development of Adorno's thought during this period.

Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began teaching at the Institute, and published articles in the ''Zeitschrift fur Socialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) that had been set up by the Institute in 1932.  Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi party.  Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began operating there.  The Nazis' rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought.  As Jürgen Habermas would later note, the fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical experiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl.  He was considered an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frankfurt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. 

Already in the late 1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture.  As propaganda and entertainment increased during the 1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships.  The essay translated as “On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s more optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62).  A primary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records.  The result was inferior to the original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school was that of Adorno. 

In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazarsfeld.  Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was.  For his part, Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music.  Adorno wrote for the Project’s journal ''Radio Research'' in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live performance.  In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243).  While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.  Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in Europe.  Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative in Europe.  The closest thing in Adorno’s experience to the advertising industry in the United States was fascist propaganda (Jäger, 2004, p. 122).

Adorno was later to allude to his experience with the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being “indistinguishable from political propaganda” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97).  It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project.  Adorno’s dissatisfaction with the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop the idea of the culture industry.  

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University, Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until November 1941.  When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Döblin, and Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry.  The fact that Adorno was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany. 
  
According to Douglas Kellner, Max Horkheimer wanted to write a “great book on dialectics,” and Herbert Marcuse, who had been admitted to the Institute in 1932, was eager to work on the project.  While Horkheimer (and later Adorno) moved to California, Marcuse went to work for the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency), and later the State Department.  Thus it was Adorno and not Marcuse who became Horkheimer’s co-author on the project on dialectics (Kellner, 1991, p. xviii).  The work that resulted was ''The Dialectic of Enlightenment'', with its section titled “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception” drafted by Adorno.  

These preconditions—Adorno’s interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industry—are all important to an understanding of his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

== “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception” ==

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art.  They were instead a business, and this in turn became an ideology “to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95).  This business was based on what Adorno referred to as “Fordist capitalism,” in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 142).  Examples of this—not specified by Adorno—were the Hollywood production system, or the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project.  Movies and hit songs were based on formulas, and “the formula supplants the work” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 99).  Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system, and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 106-7).  Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules.  The elasticity in the system would allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual (Friedman, 1981, p. 165).  Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic coercion ultimately meant the “freedom to be the same” (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, “The Culture Industry” has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.  Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 101).  It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture industry, but modernism.  Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry, Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis.  Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement, but refused to do so when it was a question of abolishing hunger (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 111).  

''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' was issued in mimeograph form in 1944, in German, and thus would have limited impact outside of the expatriate community.  In the meantime Adorno began working, along with Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson, and R. Nevitt Sanford, on an empirical investigation into prejudice titled ''The Authoritarian Personality''.  He wrote ''Minima Moralia: Reflections on Damaged Life'' in 1945, and this work, upon its publication in Germany in 1951, would mark the beginning of his impact in Germany (Jäger, 2004, p. 167).  Adorno would also co-author ''Composing for the Films'' with Hans Eisler, and in this text Adorno made it clear that the culture industry is not identical with high or low art (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 134).  This is perhaps the first of several of Adorno’s attempts at redefining the culture industry to an audience that in all probability had no exposure to the concept as it was detailed in the original essay.

== Return to Germany ==

''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' was published in Amsterdam in German in 1947 with a number of variants, excluding words and phrases in the published edition that could be construed as being Marxist (Morris, 2001, p. 48).  Their apparent intent was to not attract the attention of the American occupation authorities in Germany.  One of the main reasons for this is that Horkheimer wanted to return the Institute for Social Research to Germany, not only because of the desire to return to Frankfurt but also because a committee at Columbia University had evaluated the work of the Institute and recommended that the Institute become a department of Paul Lazarsfeld’s Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia (Jäger, 2004, p. 149).  Marcuse, who had been producing propaganda for the OSS during the war based on his expert knowledge of Germany, published revolutionary theses in a journal in 1947, and these theses could not be reconciled with the direction of the Institute due to an apparent change in Horkheimer’s attitude towards Marxism. Thus, when excerpts from ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany.  In the late 1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951.  Horkheimer became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt.

In 1954 Adorno published an essay entitled “How to Look at Television” that was the result of a study that had been done for the Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others.  In this essay Adorno warned, “rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed of psychological control” (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160).  It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture.  At least one observer found it strange that “the leading cultural theorist of his day” did not take part in cultural developments of the fifties (Jäger, 2004, p. 191).  Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape his thought on the culture industry.  For example, in 1959 he wrote of a “universal pseudo-culture” in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on “The Culture Industry Reconsidered.”  In 1966, when writing the essay “Transparencies on Film,” Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

== One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of “The Culture Industry” ==

Adorno took over running the Institute in 1960, and his primary philosophical concern in the 1960s was his critical engagement with Martin Heidegger, especially Heidegger’s language, as detailed in the book ''The Jargon of Authenticity''.  In the meantime, Marcuse had developed a critique of Stalinism, and was developing a critique of social conditions in Western democracies, in part based on his familiarity with Adorno's work. He was, for example, connecting “the analysis and critique of false needs to a critical theory of mass media and popular culture” (Agger, 1995, p. 34).  Marcuse did not oppose popular culture as completely as Adorno, however, recognizing “fissures in the edifice of mainstream mass culture which could be pried open still further” (Agger, 1995, p. 34).  In ''One-Dimensional Man'' Marcuse put an analysis “of late capitalist society into a systematic context,” as opposed to other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609).  Instead of culture serving ideological ends, for Marcuse “social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society” (Reitz, 2000, p. 144).  Capitalist production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a “system of repressive affluence” that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83).  The entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.   

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions (Marcuse, 1991, p. 8).  However, it is difficult in Marcuse's argument to separate culture or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno had done.  In the end Marcuse’s analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant ideology.  Marcuse wrote, &quot;how can the administered individuals—who have made their mutilation into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scale—liberate themselves from themselves as well as from their masters?  How is it even thinkable that the vicious circle be broken?” (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book, it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.  In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist.  Like others associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).  

While Marcuse was writing a work that would become essential to student movements in the 1960s, in 1961 Adorno and Horkheimer resisted the reissue of ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' that had been proposed to them by the publishing house of Fischer. The publisher felt that the book could be read as a description of prevailing conditions in Germany.  Marcuse enthusiastically supported the reissue of the book in 1962, but Adorno and Horkheimer withheld their consent (Jäger, 2004, p. 194).   The reasons that Horkheimer and Adorno tried to keep ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' from reaching a wider audience are not entirely clear.  In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the work required too much revision to receive mass dissemination.  The two authors continued to negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals in the German student movement.  Students also began posting snippets of the text as handbills.  

While student movements in the United States and Germany looked to Herbert Marcuse as their idol, the situation in Frankfurt degenerated to the point at which Adorno could no longer effectively conduct classes.  He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making teaching impossible.  In the winter term of 1968-69 students occupied a number of buildings at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research.  After the strike ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared their breasts.  Adorno died a few months later (Jäger, 2004, p. 201-08).

== Critical Response to “The Culture Industry” ==

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the culture industry outside of a German context.  In the years since there have been numerous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113).  For the generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cultural production, and failed to examine the culture industry’s economic dependence on other business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).  

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, believing that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 46).  Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36).  Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.  While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial societies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 146-48).  Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

According to Hohendahl, for many postmodern critics the essay on the culture industry is problematic because they confuse the defense of modernist art with a defense of high culture, against popular culture.  In the context of ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' it is the destruction of traditional culture that is in question, along with its replacement with new forms depending on commodity exchange (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 137).  In relation to this Deborah Cook cites such artists as Schoenberg, Beckett, and Kafka as cultural producers who are not entirely subject to commodification, and notes that Jameson is in agreement that modernism is the “dialectical opposite of mass culture” (Cook, 1996, p. 107).  Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant ideology.  As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends.  

The idea of the culture industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and hence, society.  Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry.  It is nonetheless the case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely on formulaic plots.  It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate.  As a broadcast medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with them qualities that situation it in the culture industry.  While there is a democratizing aspect to the Internet (in that anyone can create a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function.  For example, one seldom sees new stories on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate America.  A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary in order to theorize on how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, &quot;All living entities, beings and creatures communicate.&quot; In a an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - &quot;All of &quot;The Living&quot; communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf (communication that it is dehydrated, thirsty per se, dying); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.). Henceforth, Everything living communicates.&quot;

== Social Systems ==
When the second World War ended in Europe, seventeen-year-old Niklas Luhmann had been serving as an anti-aircraft auxiliary in the German army. He was briefly detained by the Americans. When asked in 1987 to describe this experience, he replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Before 1945, the hope was that after the defeat of the compulsory apparatus everything would be right by itself. Yet the first thing I experienced in American captivity was that my watch was taken off my arm and that I was beaten up. So it was not at all as I had thought it would be. Soon you could see that one could not compare political regimes according to a scheme of `good' versus `bad', but that you had to judge the figures according to a bounded reality. Of course I don't want to say that the time of the Nazi-regime and the time after 1945 are to be judged on equal terms. Yet I was simply disappointed in 1945. Yet is that really important? In any case the experience of the Nazi-regime for me has not been a moral one, but an experience of the arbitrary, of power, of the tactics to avoid the regime used by the man of the people. (Luhmann qtd. in Baecker, 2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The realization that human realities were subjective appears to have influenced the famous sociologist throughout the rest of his life. This chapter will introduce Luhmann and a few remarkable aspects of his theory.

=== Introduction ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The type of communication theory I am trying to advise therefore starts from the premise that communication is improbable, despite the fact that we experience and practice it every day of our lives and would not exist without it. This improbability of which we have become unaware must first be understood, and to do so requires what might be described as a contra-phenomenological effort, viewing communication not as a phenomenon but as a problem; thus, instead of looking for the most appropriate concept to cover the facts, we must first ask how communication is possible at all. (Luhmann 1990, p. 87)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The body of work produced by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann probably represents history’s most comprehensive attempt by one man to explain the whole of social existence. The above quotation hints at the essential nature of Luhmann’s thought – no “accepted wisdom” of the social science tradition could be left unexamined. Through more than 50 books and 400 articles, Luhmann applied his sociological systems theory to areas including law, science, religion, economics, politics, love, and art. Sociological systems have become one of the most popular theoretical models in contemporary German sociology, and are also widely applied in fields such as psychology, management science, and literary studies. A primary distinction of Luhmann’s social systems theory is that its focus of analysis is not individuals, groups, behaviors, or institutions, but the communication that occurs within systems. Dirk Baecker, a student of Luhmann’s explains that the systems theory “does away with the notion of system in all its traditional wording” and can carefully examine “every possible assumption of organism, mechanism, and information” – even, recursively, its own structure (Baecker 2001, p. 72). This realignment towards communication represents a significant break with social science tradition. Although Luhmann’s theory (or for that matter, most systems theories) do not lend themselves well to reduction, this chapter will attempt to present an overview of the subject.

=== Life in Brief ===
Niklas Luhmann was born in 1927. Following his teenage stint in the army, he went on to study law at the Universität Freiburg from 1946-1949 (Müller 2005). He trained as a lawyer, but found the intellectual constraints of practicing law not to his liking. He decided to go into public administration, as it promised him more freedom to pursue his own ideas (Hornung 1998). Luhmann became a civil servant for the town of Lüneburg in 1954. Although he enjoyed his work, he accepted the opportunity to take a sabbatical leave to study administrative science at Harvard University in 1960. Here Luhmann became a student of systems theorist Talcott Parsons, a thinker who would have a great impact on the development of Luhmann’s theories. After returning to Germany in 1961, Luhmann transferred to a research institute at the Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften (School of Public Administration) in Speyer. Here he was afforded the freedom to pursue his scientific interests, and began his research of social structure. 

In 1965, Luhmann studied Sociology for a single semester at the Universität Münster. He was awarded a PhD and Habilitation (a postdoctoral qualification enabling one to teach at the university level) for two books previously published. After briefly occupying [[../The Frankfurt School|Theodor Adorno]]’s former chair at the Universität Frankfurt, (where he taught a poorly-attended seminar on the sociology of love), he accepted a position at the newly-founded Reformuniversität Bielefeld (Baecker, 2005). 

In 1973 he engaged in a debate with theorist [[w:Habermas|Jürgen Habermas]] about the role of social theory. This debate was later published as a series of essays in ''Theorie der Gesellschaft oder Sozialtechnologie: Was leistet die Systemforschung?'' (''Theory of Society or Social Technology: What can Systems Research Accomplish?'') (1973). The debate with Habermas (whose theory receives a much wider acceptance outside of Germany) served as the Anglophonic world’s major introduction to Luhmann’s thought.

Luhmann published profusely throughout his career, with each book and essay building a foundation for his final theory of society. He retired from this position in 1993, but continued to publish. His magnum opus, ''Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft'' (''The Society of the Society'') was published a year before his death in 1997.

=== Early Influences ===
By the end of the 19th century, industrialization had profoundly changed the Western world. Sociology had come into its own as a science: Karl Marx published profusely throughout the mid-1800s. [[w:Ferdinand Tonnies|Ferdinand Tönnies]] (1887) described social flows from Gemeinschaft (community, relationship oriented association) toward Gesellschaft (self interest oriented society) in 1887. Emile Durkheim (1893) explored the division of labor a few years later, and opened the first European sociology department in 1896. [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] developed new methodological approaches and also founded a sociology department by 1920. While these fathers of the discipline differed greatly in their research and philosophy of society, they all recognized that the function and dysfunction of society is linked to the function and dysfunction of different social components such as classes, institutions, technologies, or individuals. 

==== Durkheim’s Functionalism ====
Durkheim’s theory of functionalism, in particular, had a lasting impact upon the social sciences. Durkheim argued that “social facts” existed independent of individuals and institutions, and that these facts were the most productive subject for empirical sociological research. Social facts (such as suicide rates (Durkheim 1951), policies, or church attendance) can be measured, interpreted, and tested. Social theories derived from these analyses can then be used to explain social functioning.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The determination of function is . . . necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena. . . .To explain a social fact it is not enough to show the cause on which it depends; we must also, at least in most cases, show its function in the establishment of social order.  (1950, p. 97)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Durkheim’s functionalism measured social effects within the context of a larger social environment. Durkheim’s 1893 book The Division of Labor in Society focused on labor division in an attempt to describe and explain social order. He elaborated on the manner in which increasing labor division affects the evolution of societies.

==== Parsonian Social Systems ====
Talcott Parsons, who would become America’s preeminent social theorist throughout the mid-20th century, drew on Durkheim’s functionalism in the development of his theory of social action. He was also able to integrate concepts from the burgeoning fields of general systems theory (von Bertalanffy, 1950; 1976), information theory (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949), and social cybernetics (Wiener, 1948; 1950). Whereas Durkheim was content to develop sociology as a discipline alongside the other social sciences, Parsons became the advocate of a “grand theory” that could subsume the other social sciences. Drawing heavily from Weber’s writings on action (which Parsons translated himself), Parsons’ functionalism was developed as a theory of action. Individuals were understood as acting of their own volition, influenced in their behavior by external forces. As a component of this larger theory, Parsons developed the theory of the social system. His “social system” is generally synonymous with the term “society” and emerges from the interaction of individuals (Parsons, 1951). For the purposes of this chapter only a few features of Parson’s theory can be discussed. These will include his conceptions of the functional imperatives of action and the notion of equilibrium.

===== Equilibrium =====
Parsons’ social equilibrium is the orderly, smoothly functioning society. It is the result of individuals' acting according to the norms and values that have been provided in their social environment (Parsons, 1951). Parsonian social systems tended towards equilibrium, because “the actions of the members of a society are to a significant degree oriented to a single integrated system of ultimate ends common to these members” (Parsons qtd. in Heyl, 1968). The understanding of equilibrium within different societies was the primary goal of social systems theory, and (as Parsons would have it) sociology as a whole.

===== Functional imperatives of action =====
Parsons’ functional imperatives of action were developed as a way to classify the goals that “action systems” (be it individuals, institutions, or groups) would pursue to reach equilibrium. His AGIL model (adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, latent pattern maintenance) remains one of his most famous formulations.

: '''A''' - The function of adaptation addresses the fact that resources in the environment are scarce, and the system must secure and distribute these resources. For social systems, social institutions are employed to meet these needs. The economy is generally identified as the primary institution that meets this need.
: '''G''' - The function of goal-attainment deals with the system’s desire to use resources to achieve specific situational ends. Political institutions generally fulfill this role for social systems. 
: '''I''' – Integration is the most complex and problematic of the functional imperatives. It addresses the need for a system to coordinate and regulate the various subunits within a system. Integration of social systems is often associated with laws and norms, and judicial institutions. 
: '''L''' – Finally, the function of pattern maintenance refers to a system’s ability to maintain its own stability, and consists of two distinct components. For social systems, the first component deals with the ability of the system to motivate normative behavior of actors. The second component is involved with the transmission of social values. This imperative might be institutionally satisfied by education and religion (Wallace &amp; Wolf, 1991).

The actions of an individual, for example, could then be compared to the actions of an institution within this framework. The social system, also subject to these imperatives, is in equilibrium because all of its constituent actors are morally impelled to perform socially-expected functions. As might be expected, Parsons’ early work was frequently criticized for failing to account for social change, the opposite of social equilibrium. Parsons eventually developed an evolutionary model of social change that described incremental adjustments occurring through slight disruptions of the social system’s equilibrium.

=== Luhmann and Social Systems ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sociology is stuck in a theory crisis. (Luhmann, 1995, p. xlv)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Luhmann criticized the sociology of his time as being irredeemably subjective and unable to usefully describe reality. “Action theory is reconstructed as structural theory, structural theory as linguistic theory, linguistic theory as textual theory, and textual theory as action theory” (Luhmann, 1995, p. xlvi). The acquisition of new knowledge, Luhmann argued, was derived from some recombination of the work of classical theorists. Social theory spiraled into higher and higher levels of complexity, each refocusing and realignment of classical theory laying the foundation for ever more complex theoretical iterations. Luhmann set his personal task as no less than the complete theoretical reconceptualization of the discipline within a wholly consistent framework.

Luhmann’s sociological systems theory makes only two fundamental assumptions: that reality exists, and that systems exist (Luhmann, 1995, p. 12). The theory contains a constructivist epistemology, as it claims that knowledge can only exist as a construction of human consciousness. Luhmann does not claim that there is no external reality, but that our knowledge of it will always be subject to the symbolic system we use to represent it. 

From these simple assumptions, Luhmann attempts to build a universal social theory: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Theory… claims neither to reflect the complete reality of its object, nor to exhaust all the possibilities of knowing its object. Therefore it does not demand exclusivity for its truth claims in relation to other, competing endeavors. But it does claim universality for its grasp of its object in the sense that it deals with everything social and not just sections. (Luhmann, 1995, p. xlv)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory is universal because it seeks to describe and explain itself, along with all other social phenomena. The theory is self-referential.

Luhmann proceeds to clarify three fundamental differences between his theory and previous social theories. First, his theory is universal and can be applied to all social phenomena. Second, his theory is self-referential, and capable of examining itself in its own terms. Third, his theory is both complex and abstract enough to accomplish the previous two goals (Luhmann, 1995, xlviii).

There is no default entry point to Luhmann’s sociological systems theory. The structure of the theory is systemic. This means that the integration of its components is not linear and additive, but circular. The components of the theory do not build upon each other but produce each other. This introduction will attempt to show some of Luhmann’s most innovative developments, including his break from previous social systems theory.

==== A theory of communication ====
Luhmann found Parsons’ systems approach inspiring, but noticed several inconsistencies and problems. Stichweh (2000), a student of Luhmann’s, explains that there are two major strands of reasoning that led Luhmann to base his theory on communication rather than action. The first issue was that the actions of psychic systems (minds) and of social systems is difficult to distinguish using action theory. The interaction of the actor and his environment can only be described when the actor and environment are placed on the same analytic level. In Luhmann’s theory, the social system emerges from the communication between psychic systems (minds), and cannot be understood as a separate system “acting” on the individual. The second issue is that action theory cannot differentiate between action and experience. Selection (one of the components of Luhmann’s definition of communication, to be outlined below) can be viewed as either an action on the part of the selecting system, or as information about the state of the selecting system’s environment. The classification of information, Luhmann reasons, is not causally related to actors, and should be classified as experience, not action.

==== Individuals and the social system ====
One aspect of Luhmann’s theory that is significantly different from most social theories is that the human individual is not seen as focal to understanding society. In fact, Luhmann’s theory states unequivocally that the individual is not a constituent part of society. This counterintuitive claim begins to make sense if one recalls that Luhmann’s basic social element is communication. An individual is only relevant to society to the extent that they communicate. Whatever does not communicate within the society – such as biological and psychic systems – is not a part of the society. Psychic systems, or individual minds, can think but cannot communicate. In the social systems view, individuals are only loci for social communication.

==== Autopoietic systems ====
We will return to the issue of the individual within the social system after further discussion of Luhmann’s notion of “system”.  A system is emergent, in that it comes into existence as soon as a border can be drawn between a set of communications and the context of the communication, or the systems environment. A system is always less complex than its environment – if a system does not reduce the complexity in its environment, then it cannot perform any function. A system effectively defines itself by creating and maintaining a border between itself and the environment. In the case of biological systems, this concept of systemic self-generation was first identified and examined by Maturana and Varela (1980). They termed the self-generation of biological systems “autopoietic”. Luhmann believed that autopoiesis could be usefully applied to social systems as well. Luhmann’s autopoietic systems do more than just define their own borders. They also produce their own components and organizational structures. The major benefit of the autopoietic perspective on social systems is that it presents them without ambiguity, and not as something that can be reduced to anything other than itself, such as “consciousness” or a sum of actions (Anderson, 2003). Returning to the issue of the individual, it is again possible to see why individuals cannot be components of social systems – social systems are comprised of communications and therefore produce communications, not people (“Niklas Luhmann,” 2005).

==== Communication as selection ====
Another Luhmannian conception that might seem counterintuitive is his subjectless, actionless definition of communication. “Communication is coordinated selectivity. It comes about only if ego fixes his own state on the basis of uttered information” (Luhmann, 1995, p. 154). Luhmann criticizes the “transmission” metaphor of communication because “it implies too much ontology” and that “the entire metaphor or possessing, having, giving, and receiving” is unsuitable (1995, p. 139). For Luhmann, communication is not an “action” performed by an “actor” but a selection performed by a system. This &quot;selection&quot; that results in communication is more similar to Darwin’s “natural selection” than to the everyday usage of the term.  A social system generates communication much as a natural environment generates biological traits.

The selection process that Luhmann terms communication is actually a synthesis of three separate selections: the selection of information, the selection of a form, and the selection of an understanding (Anderson, 2003). Following Shannon and Weaver’s (1949) theory of information, Luhmann identifies information as a selection from a “repertoire of possibilities” (1995, p.140). The form of a communication is how the message is communicated. The selection of understanding refers to what should be understood about the message. A critical note here is that understanding does not refer to the message’s reception by a psychic system, but rather the linkage of the message to subsequent communications (Anderson, 2003). The result of this selection process is the creation of meaning, which is the medium of communication in social systems (Luhmann, 1995, p. 140). 

Social (and psychic) systems construct and sustain themselves in this way through communication. Communications can only exist as a product of social (and psychic) systems. Society is then a self-descriptive system that contains its own description. Luhmann recognizes that this definition is recursive and antithetical to classical scientific theory (“Soziologische Systemtheorie”, 2005).

=== Contemporary research ===
A variety of scholars today employ sociological systems analysis in fields ranging from law to literary theory. The theory is one of the most popular in German sociology, and has a significant following in continental Europe, Japan, and elsewhere (“Soziologische Systemtheorie,” 2005). Many of Luhmann’s former students and colleagues, such as Dirk Baecker, Peter Fuchs, Armin Nassehi, and Rudolf Stichweh, continue to develop the theory.

=== Conclusion ===
The preceding can only serve as the briefest of introductions to an enormous body of original thought. A lifetime’s work of thousands of pages of published text cannot be condensed into a few thousand words. This chapter has attempted to trace some of the major theoretical threads which led to the development of Luhmann’s universal theory of sociological systems. It presents some of Luhmann’s most engaging and innovative conceptual formulations. Because Luhmann’s theory represents a major break from the classical social sciences in structure and content, its comprehension requires a significant investment of intellectual effort. This effort is worthwhile, as Luhmann’s meticulous theoretical paradigm provides a useful alternative to other social science traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rebcode is a dialect for creating very high performance code which can be useful for heavy computations and for creating algorithms.

In essence, Rebcode is an assembly language within REBOL. Rebcode should only be used when it's necessary, since it's based on performance, not ease of use, and is tedious to work with for longer scripts.

Also since Rebcode is designed for performance, it does not check for mistakes, and '''mistakes in Rebcode can crash REBOL''', just like any other assembly language.

Rebcode is currently pre-alpha and is not finished. This section of the book will not be completed until we have a stable version of Rebcode which won't change too much or the release of a public release or late beta.

&quot;MetaClasses&quot; is nonstandard capitalization. It's one word and should have no special caps; just &quot;metaclasses&quot; (but &quot;Metaclasses&quot; since it's part of a title).

Welcome to the English Wikibook for learning the Persian Language.

This course requires no prior knowledge of Persian.  It aims to teach grammar, vocabulary, common phrases, conversational language, and formal/literary Persian.  By the end, you should be able to read and write Persian but will probably need a human teacher to help with listening and speaking.  The book is meant to be read starting with lesson 1 and moving forward.  It will move slowly.

== The Persian Language ==
Persian (local names: ''Parsi'', ''Farsi'' or ''Dari'') is an Indo-European language, the dominant language of the Indo-Iranian language family and is a major language of antiquity. After the 7th century Persian absorbed a great deal of Arabic vocabulary. Persian is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. Persian is also a popular language in academia and business. Related languages include Pashto, Kurdish, Ossetian, and Balochi. Urdu and Turkish also have a sizable vocabulary from Persian.

[[Image:Iranian-languages-map.jpg|400px|right|the distribution of Iranian languages]]

== Persian or Farsi? ==
''Farsi'' is an Arabized form of the word ''Parsi'', one of the original names in Persian for the Persian language. Since there is no [p] sound in Arabic, ''Parsi'' became ''Farsi'' after the Arab conquest of Persia. ''Farsi'' then became the local name of Persian, but English speakers still call the language “Persian”, just as they say “German”, “Spanish”, and “Chinese” for languages locally called ''Deutsch'', ''español'', and ''Hanyu''.  There is considerable opposition to calling Persian ''Farsi'' in English and other languages, as is summarized by the following pronouncement on the English name of Persian language by the ''Academy of Persian language and literature'':
# “Persian” has been used in a variety of publications including cultural, scientific and diplomatic documents for centuries and, therefore, it carries a very significant historical and cultural meaning. Hence, changing “Persian” to “Farsi” would negate this established important precedent.
# Changing the usage from “Persian” to “Farsi” may give the impression that “Farsi” is a new language, although this may well be the intention of some users of “Farsi”.
# Changing the usage may also give the impression that “Farsi” is a dialect used in some parts of Iran rather than the predominant (and official) language of the country.
# The word “Farsi” has never been used in any research paper or university document in any Western language, and the proposal to begin using it would create doubt and ambiguity about the name of the official language of Iran.

== Persian and English ==
Since Persian and English are both Indo-European languages, many basic Persian words are familiar to English speakers. For example {{term-fa|مادر|mâdar|mother}}, {{term-fa|پدر|pedar|father}}, and {{term-fa|برادر|barâdar|brother}}.

== Pronunciation ==
Although Persian was influenced by Arabic, English speakers should not find it too difficult to pronounce Persian letters fairly well. Fortunately for English speakers, the [[w:Glottal stop|glottal stop]] &lt;big&gt;[[w:Hamza|ء]]&lt;/big&gt; [ʔ] from Arabic is barely pronounced in Persian, and the “emphatic” consonants in Arabic (&lt;big&gt;[[wikt:ط#Arabic|ط]] [[wikt:ض#Arabic|ض]] [[wikt:ص#Arabic|ص]] [[wikt:ظ‎#Arabic|ظ‎]] [[wikt:ح‎#Arabic|ح‎]] [[wikt:ع#Arabic|ع]]&lt;/big&gt;) are pronounced without the [[w:Pharyngealization|pharyngealization]], making them much easier for most native English speakers.

It is important to listen to Persian often and to try to use the language. Pronunciation guides can only closely convey the sounds of Persian but are never totally exact, so pronunciation benefits greatly from listening to native speakers.

== Transcription ==
There are several systems of transcription to represent the sounds of Persian in the [[w:Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]].  This book uses the [[w:Perso-Latin_Alphabet#UniPers|UniPers (also called ''Pârsiye Jahâni'', &quot;Universal Persian&quot;)]] transcription system, which uses the basic Latin alphabet plus a few modified letters (‹â›, ‹š›, ‹ž›, and an apostrophe ‹’›) as a standard phonemic script that is clear, simple, and consistent. Each transcription is enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., ‹fârsi›:
{{Persian/Transcription key}}

== Vocabulary and grammar ==
In learning to read or speak any language, the two aspects to be mastered are vocabulary and grammar. Acquiring vocabulary is a matter of memorization. Children learn thousands of words of their native language by the time they are conscious of the learning process, so it is easy to underestimate importance of having a large vocabulary. This process can be reactivated by immersion: moving to where the language is spoken and one’s native tongue cannot be used for daily communication.

Without the opportunity to move to a Persian-speaking area, a student must make a substantial effort to learn the meaning, pronunciation, and proper use of words. Be sure to learn all of the vocabulary words in each lesson. Early lessons have simple sentences because the student’s vocabulary is presumably limited, but more complex sentences in later lessons demonstrate more typical Persian. It may be helpful to translate these using a Persian-English dictionary.  Access to a print dictionary is very helpful. Other sources of Persian, such as newspapers, magazines, and web sites can help to build vocabulary and to develop a sense of how Persian sentences are put together.

== Resources ==
The Internet has a wide variety of study resources. You can refer to the appendix of this book for a selection of some of the best sources:

* [[Persian/Websites|Websites]] 
* [[wikt:Category:Persian language|Persian - English Wiktionary]]

Also, each new vocabulary term introduced in this course can be looked up easily in the English Wiktionary wherever the dictionary image [[Image:Wiktionary-logo wpstyle-en with transparency.png|32px|link=wikt:فارسی#Persian|Look up فارسی in Wiktionary]] appears.   Click on the image to look up a Persian word wherever you see a link like the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">In my opinion most of this chapter could be deleted because the basic rotation/location/scaling operations have been explained before already. What new in this chapter is the ''Putting it on'' (i.e. making parent) and the ''adding color'' (which doesn't belong in this chapter though)

Why doesn't my text show up on the discussion page? :-?

Under version 2.37a (still a problem with 2.42a too), the model is already created as one object; it appears to be impossible to select just one group, such as the hat or the head, in object mode.

Solution: 
i) While in EDIT MODE select all the vertices for the Hat then press the PKEY. In Seperate menu simply select &quot;selected&quot;. The Hat and the Man will now be seperate objects.
ii) With the hat still selected press f9 and in the mesh pannel click on center new, this will give the hat its own center point.

Alternative solution:
Before creating the hat, deselect the man by pressing AKEY.  Then create the hat as normal.

== Pictures? ==

It could be useful getting some pictures in this area. It gives a good guide for what to work towards. Without images some of the things don't quite workas explained and arn't as easy to correct without it.

== Confusing ==
The tutorial up until now was really clear and easy to follow. This chapter sort of hit me like a brick wall. I have the man's body, his head, and his hat. How do I attach his head to his body first? I don't want his head to act like his hat (able to move separately from his body).
:Is it possible that you added the head while you were in object mode rather than edit mode? If this is the case I don't know how you would 'combine' the objects (head and body) but if I find a way I will come back and post here.

== Color the hat? ==
Tried to follow the same steps to color the hat but couldnt get the same material options to come up...is coloring the hat beyond the scope of the tutorial at this point?
:For anybody that's confused after reading this the coloring section was removed on 22 February 2007.[[User:Aineolach|Aineolach]] ([[User talk:Aineolach|talk]]) 17:18, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

== Selection -&gt; Center as way to move object center (pink dot) ==
This method doesn't seem to work for me the way it is implied. &quot;Or you could hit SHIFT+SKEY, select Selection → Center. &quot; From the text I got the understanding that this would move the dot to the cursor, but this function doesn't seem to do that. Maybe it's just me but if this is supposed to facilitate moving the object's center I think it needs to be reworded.

== Merge with previous page ==

Hi guys, I think the content required for this page is just too little to merit it's existence. I propose we merge it with ''Creating A Simple Hat'', the previous module. What do you think?  --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 02:39, 27 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Notes and questions ==

Wikijunior books would like to introduce a free children's book from all the writers at Wikibooks. &quot;The Solar System&quot; is a fabulous place for children to learn about - and why buy a book about it in a store, when you can get all the facts and pictures from the experts and writers at wiki?

Let's not bash the comercial distributer who might copy this text. The discount versions provided directly to children might says something like: This printing of the wikibook has been provided at a reduced cost by the Beck Foundation. or This printing of the wikibook has been provided at a reduced cost by a group of really bad people to draw children into a life of crime. It should be something the printer puts in.

Wikibooks is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at providing quality reading for adults and children minus the cost or trouble of going and getting books from a library or store. 

Getting it at a store or library may be the easiest way to get the book.

The people here at all the wiki projects are here because they want to advance the cause of learning, and increase the global spread of knowledge. Nobody was paid to write this book's manuscript, and no single person tries to lay claim to its pages or what they contain. When the first launched into cyberspace as a full, finished version it will be independent of a publishing corporation, independent of a printer, and free from all that is part of normal book making.

There are many discussions about the use of free vs. open source. Free might imply you don't have to pay for the printed copy. --[[User:Gbleem|Gbleem]] 17:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

== provider introduction ==

There should probably be a separate printer/distributer introduction. I'm sure any printer or distributer will add their own. They would probably leave in the wikibook introduction if it limits it's scope.

== Questions, comments about the text ==

'''Capitalisation of the Sun.''' The Sun should be capitalised. A sun should not. &quot;Sun&quot; is a proper noun when used as the name of this solar system's star. Same goes for the Moon vs a moon. [[User:203.22.236.14|203.22.236.14]] 14:07, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

:I would have to concurr on this point.  I've tried to use the capitalized version throughout this whole Wikibook as it is a proper noun, and one solution to this by Science Fiction writers is to use the Latinized version of these celestial bodies like Sol and Luna instead.  I am not advocating this approach, as I consider &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Moon&quot; to be proper names for these object, and ones that kids should be familar with if they speak English.  However, if you are refering to &quot;the moons of Mars&quot;, moon is in lowercase.  This makes a spellchecker something that causes heartburn on projects like this, but it is something that perhaps we need to deal with and check.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:09, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

== Pluto and Dwarf Planets? ==

'''Pluto.''' I removed references to pluto as a planet in the introduction. Should this be done throughout the text? Should there be a separate category for dwarf planets? Should I have discussed it before making such a change? I'm new to this.--[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 04 September 2006

Pluto and Dwarf Planets are something that should be mentioned, in my opinion. In the line about planets, it says there are many types, including rocky and gas. What about dwarf? [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 05:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

==Edit of Introduction Page==

I rewrote the measurement section to be as clear and as brief as possible, ensuring that this section is accessible and not off-putting to young readers who need the information. I also took out the section &quot;What is in the night sky?&quot; as I felt it was repeating much of what is said in the Solar System module. I replaced it with some discussion on how scientists study the solar system, which covers how we know what we know. I don't think this is covered in the rest of the book and it is appropriately introductory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regionalisation ==

In International Relations regionalisation (or regionalism) is actually the set of processes that lead states to work together in an international system on a regional scale. From the realist perspective of International Relations it is actually an outward expansion from the nation state.

Behind the process of regionalisation lies the concept of regionalism. This can be seen as the normative aspects, or values, that underly regionalisation e.g. the (contested) European identity. However, it is also a theoretical tool for analysis of international relations. For example the concept of security regime in regional security would not be possible without the analytic tool of 'regionalism'.

= Theories of International Relations =
== Introduction ==

In actual fact, the commonly used term/title &quot;Theories of International Relations&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer because in practice, most books or articles on this topic do not present theories OF international relations, but theories IN/WITHIN international relations (insofar as international relations is an identifiable field of inquiry). The heading theories OF international relations might be more appropriate in epistemological discussions where the object of inquiry would be theories about the field of international relations, rather than disparate theories that are within the field and focus on different aspects of the international relations world.

== Realism ==

Realism is the traditional school of international relations theory. It developed as a method of analysis of international relations when political actors consisted almost exclusively of '''states'''. Thus, it is a state-centred view of international relations and discounts the importance of other actors such as international organisations, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), terrorist organisations, etc. It is assumed that all states act for their own interest, and that all states, in a given situation, will act the same way.

=== Survival, Territorial Integrity, Population ===

It has been posited that a state requires three main elements to survive. The top three priorities for a state (the &quot;national self-interest&quot;) have been posited to be survival, territorial integrity, and population, in that order:
*'''Survival''' its existence as a state, with sovereign boundaries, administration, and control within its boundaries (threat of force).
*'''Territorial Integrity''' considered breached if another state launches an invasion; a breach of territorial integrity does not necessarily mean that a state is defeated (for example, the invaded state may choose to launch a counter-attack), but rather, may sometimes be compromised to ensure a state's survival
*'''Population''' can sometimes be compromised (e.g. conscription in the army)

== Critical Theory ==
== Marxist International Theory ==

== Green Theory ==
Green Theory in International Relations:  Sustainable Environment

==Dramaturgical Theory==
Dramaturgical theory is based heavily on Erving Goffman's sociological work, especially his description of impression management. Nations and other international actors are treated as trying not only to advance their own interests in the short-term, but create long-lasting impressions of their cultures, habits, etc. that foreigners (and possibly their own citizens) will take as true.
Gregory Adams did the most work in developing it.

== Feminist Theory ==
Feminist theory in international relations considers the effects of male domination in international relations and its related fields.

== The Clash of Civilisations Thesis ==
The Clash of Civilizations thesis is a theory developed by Samuel P. Huntington to explain conflict in the post-cold war world. Huntington predicted that post cold war conflict would take place between civilizations defined along broad ethnic and religious lines. The civilizations he predicted were the Western, orthodox, Islamic, African, Latin American, Sinic, Buddhist, Hindu and Japanese.

Are you sure it's a good idea to write this chapter before the previous ones? As it is, we will have to (and already are) making assumptions about what will be taught in 
them. IMO we should write the chapters in order. Anybody have comments? [[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 17:24 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)

: Well, when I have time, I'll go fill in the others. The stuff on differentiation requires nice pictures and demonstrative examples, which will take a lot of time to fix and prepare, whilst integration is more a symbolic thing and ''most'' of it can be written without having diagrams and such (but they will be needed later)

== Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ==

Perhaps I missed it (completely possible as I'm a bit of a Wiki newbie) but I didn't see mention of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC).
IMHO, the FTC is one of the most &quot;surprising results&quot; in mathematics.
First, I think that integration is not really about finding anti-derivatives, though certainly it involves using them.
Integration is about infinite sums (of areas).
Second, the surprising thing is that if we look at a function (f) between A and B, find the anti-derivitive of f (F), then take Fs value at B and subtract Fs value at A then that gives us (drum roll please) the exact area under the curve (f) between A and B!
How???
Of course, there is a good reason but the FTC was, and I think still is, a rather surprising thing to discover.

Okay, this is starting to look like a rant... sorry.  Wistful recolleciton of my days teaching college Calculus, I suppose.  Anyway, please let me know if I simply missed it somewhere -- maybe it's planned but not written or something like that.  Thanks.

== Exception ==

It should be explicitly noted, although it is implied by the (alpha + 1) factor in the denominator, that the power rule for integration does not hold for alpha = -1.

Welcome to another Wikibook. As you most likely know, Wikibooks are a division of the Wikimedia foundation (a free open-source media project), and they are generated, edited, proofed, and read by online contributors, fans, and scholars. Each book is a labor of love on the part of its many creators because no contributor is paid for their works and no person is held in higher regard than his peers. All wiki products are made for the advancement of knowledge and the spread of intellect. They are free to every person who can access them. Every book is edited to perfection by all the thousands of volunteers who process the ideas contained within them. Now we, the creators, wish to invite you inside this wikibook and to learn about the written word.

Where would we be without the classical science that has evolved to be language and writing? Would we be bone-toting barbarians living in caves and wearing furs?  Would we be using sign language?  What would we do without the words that are written within this book? The written word has created and destroyed life, instigated wars and the sought peace after, the word has been the epoch of love and the credulity of hate, and the written word has shaped the age we now live in. What happened to create the alphabets of today, and what place will our words take us tomorrow? If you wish to read more, just &quot;open&quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Written_Word:Contents] this wikibook.

==Writer's Manual==
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this wikibook, this manuscript is in desperate need of additional content. Please add all content and pictures you can. Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is A Word==

The Written Word is the basic building block of knowledge. It allows a way to leave information behind, to be read years or decades later. The way you use them, and how effectively, determines how the information is received.
Consider this: when we have a math teacher who stands at the front of a classroom and talks in a monotone voice, with absolutely no expression, boredom will ensue, no matter how interested a student is. Compare this to a teacher who is enthusiastic, who explains things in an uptone style, and students will have a difficult time not becoming interested.
This is commonly the difference between good and bad writing. This isn't just limited to novels, but to every kind of text. While novels are the ones who most commonly use vivid descriptions and nuances in the writing, it should be noted that the same techniques can be used elsewhere.

==Word Theory==

According to Wiktionary, a word[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/word] is a distinct unit of language with a particular meaning 

In the classical Roman form of writing, each word is formed by a series of characters. The Roman classical alphabet is as follows:

{| style=&quot;width:400px; height:25px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- 
| a,A
| b,B
| c,C
| d,D
| e,E 
| f,F
| g,G
| h,H
| i,I
| j,J
| k,K
| l,L
| m,M
| n,N
| o,O
| p,P
| q,Q
| r,R
| s,S
| t,T
| u,U
| v,V
| w,W
| x,X
| y,Y
| z,Z
|}
Each character is designed to make a specific sound when pronounced. And when the sounds are placed together they make the noises that the human brain translates as &quot;words&quot;. Specific groupings of characters can be placed together to form sounds, that without the grouping, would take too many characters and would be tedious to write. Letters make sounds according to the others that surround them in words. For example, the letters &quot;c&quot; and &quot;h&quot; when placed together make the sound &quot;cha&quot; but spelling is still just &quot;ch&quot;. 

Writing and Speaking are opposites, but they are opposites that attract. Most people that write also know how to speak and vice versa, but take one skill away and the other will quickly deteriorate. People who cannot write rarely speak well, and people who cannot speak (not counting a prohibitive disease) are rarely good writers.

The first organized alphabet of characters is believed to be mesopotamian Cuneiform. *Still working*

It is also to be considered that in the region of the Shinnar plain
about three thousand BC and maybe even earlier, that beer drinkers were partly to blame for the formation of the first notation on clay tablets. 
Labouring in the fields growing corn and barley along with hops they were given a daily beer allowance by the landowners. Usually among drinkers of alcoholic beverages their ability to count becomes somewhat blurred so they would place several marks on these tablets according to the amount to which each was entitled.
These markings lead directly to the aforementioned cunieform.

'''Raw sugar''' is the sugar which results from removing molasses from sugar cane, before further refinement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Wikibooks and not Wikipedia ==

This is a quick note as to why I'm keeping this page even though all of the links go to Wikipedia.

Earlier I deleted all of the &quot;sub pages&quot; to this Wikibook module because it was largely duplication of previous work on Wikipedia and mainly encyclopedic articles that were poorly named as well.  I'm keeping this particular module (renamed, however) because I feel that this table is indeed something that can be kept in a simple form and not subject to the whims of Wikipedia editors unrelated to the [[General Chemistry]] Wikibook.  This also give more freedom for the authors of that Wikibook a chance to incorporate this Wikibook module more closely into the contents of that book, and even do modifications that make sense only within that book.

A &quot;generic Peroidic Table&quot; within Wikibooks is inappropriate as Wikipedia already does a pretty good job as it is.  This is a book-specific table and should be treated as such.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:01, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

== Name Change ==

You are absolutely right, this should be a simple Periodic table for the general chemistry book.  I changed the name to reflect that this is part of the General Chemistry book. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Julians|Julians]] ([[User talk:Julians|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Julians|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

== Removal of &quot;History&quot; section ==

While I'm not against adding a history section here, what was added is in clear violation of copyright and can be found here instead:

http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/ch412/perhist.htm

That is clearly copyrighted material and needs to be removed completely from this article.  Any attempt to add it back will be deleted immediately because we simply can't have that on Wikibooks.  If you want to paraphrase it and do some scholarly research to elaborate on those ideas, but make it something original, you are welcome to do so.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:27, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Nonmetals ==

Although I like your coloring scheme, I believe it misleads students into thinking that the halogens are not nonmetals. Is there another way of assigning all the nonmetals the same color while still defining which are halogens and noble gases?

We don't need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
We can just change &quot;Nonmetals&quot; to &quot;Other Nonmetals,&quot; and also put something saying that the nonmetals not colored in the color are &quot;Halogens,&quot; and &quot;Noble gases&quot;.
== Germanium ==

Germanium is always considered as a metalloid. Here I put it as a metal.&lt;br /&gt;
Can someone change it to a metalloid.&lt;br /&gt;
And then I will put a citation saying why I put polonium as a metal.&lt;br /&gt;
Please also do that for the [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table/Print]] article.&lt;br /&gt;

== Lawrencium atomic weight change from [263] to [262], [262] is the most commonly stated atomic weight for Lr ==

As with No on the [[/Print]] version, on this and that I want Lr to be changed from [263] to [262], to not confuse most people.</text>

==Area - check the area==
Look for hazards. Hazards include split electrical wires, fire, unstable building structure or anything else that could present a risk to the responder. If there are hazards, remove them, or remove the victim from them if possible. If not, then retreat to a safe distance, call EMS and wait for their arrival. Make sure that you do not put yourself in danger. If you are near a road, ensure that you are clearly visible to traffic.

'''Put on gloves''' if you have them and use a '''Pocket Mask''' or '''Face Shield''' if you have access to them and need to give rescue breaths.

==Awake - check level of consciousness==
''Does the victim respond to voice?''

'''If YES''', check the victim for other conditions and call for help if necessary.

'''If NO''', call Call for help, check for breathing and if victim is not breathing start doing CPR until help arrives

==Ambulance - call EMS==
Call EMS using a bystander if possible. If you're alone, and the victim is an adult (&gt;8 years old), then leave the victim to call EMS yourself. If you're alone but the victim is a child (1-8 years old) or an infant (&lt;1 year old), then continue; you'll call EMS later.

Obtain an AED and AED-trained responder if possible. If no AED-trained responder is available and an AED is available, obtain it and follow the voice prompts given by the AED and instructional pictures. 

==Breathing - check for breathing==
Quickly remove any loose and obvious obstructions from the mouth. Check the victim for signs of obvious breathing, such as clear signs of chest rise and fall. Breathing must be regular, consistent and obvious. 

Gasping, irregular, infrequent or extremely shallow breathing should not be considered normal breathing. The victim's brain may attempt to cause breaths when the heart has stopped. If the breathing is not adequate, or you are unsure, continue CPR with compressions.

''Is the victim breathing?''

'''If YES''', place the victim in the Recovery position and call for help unless a spinal injury is suspected in which it is crucial to '''not move the patient'''.  If the patient vomits, however, it is more important to roll them over to their side while holding the back, neck, and head stable.

'''If NO''', give 30 chest compressions, then 2 rescue breaths. 

==Compressions - begin compressions==
[[Image:CPR.jpg|thumb|Correct position for CPR. The arms are fully extended and the thrusts are given from the hips.]]

*Hand/finger placement on the center of the chest, on the lower half of the breastbone. Be sure to not compress the soft area of the abdomen before the breastbone.
*After 5 cycles (approx. 2 minutes) call EMS if you haven't done so already (in the case of children or infants). If a bystander is available, get them to call immediately upon arrival. If they have to leave the area to contact EMS, tell the bystander to return to you and inform you of the ETA of the EMS.
*Compress at the rate of at least 100 per minute.
*Push at least 2&quot; (5 cm) on adults; at least 1/3rd of the chest depth for pediatric victims.
*Use two hands for adult compressions, one or two hands for children, and two fingers for infant compressions.

==Airway - open the airway==
Place one hand on the forehead and two fingers on the chin. Tilt the head back and lift the chin so the victim's jawline is perpendicular to the ground

==Breathing - give breaths==
Place a CPR shield over the victim's mouth, if available. With the head tilted back as described in &quot;Airway&quot;, pinch the victim's nose shut with the hand that in on their forehead. Place your mouth over their mouth, making a complete seal. Give a normal breath until you see chest rise. Give a second breath, then immediately go back to compressions.

Do not stop CPR to recheck for signs of life. Signs of life tend to be very dramatic and movement will be observed if the victim no longer requires CPR. Continue CPR until emergency help takes over, the victim moves, you are too exhausted to continue or the area becomes unsafe. If an AED and AED-trained responder arrives on the scene, it will have priority on the over CPR. Continue CPR until the AED operator asks you to stop.

== This summary is terrible ==

I just updated the full CPR section to reflect reality and sanity. Please change this summary so it corresponds to CPR and not someone's invention. All in all its not as bad as the full article, but its seriously out of date ie there is no circulation check, and there hasn't been for several '''years'''! [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 14:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
:Done! [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 19:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

Circulation assessments are going by the way side now.  It has been realised that most lay people can't accurately detect a pulse under pressure.  So now the recommendation is - No Breathing do CPR.

Thanks Chris Hodson
:Yes, that was updated some time ago. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:17, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

What does &quot;30-2&quot; indicate in the CPR chart? Thirty compressions to every two breaths? This can't seem right if there's 100 compressions per minute but twenty to thirty breaths in the same time (going off the &quot;breath every 2-3 seconds&quot; note). Can someone make it a little clearer? - [[Special:Contributions/124.168.114.17|124.168.114.17]] ([[User talk:124.168.114.17|talk]]) 15:05, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To begin programming in Visual Basic .NET, you can either compile directly from the command line with the .NET [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D&amp;displaylang=en SDK], use [http://msdn.microsoft.com/howtobuy/vstudio/ Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE], or the open-source [http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/ SharpDevelop IDE].

In this manual, however, we will only be covering Microsoft's official IDE.  Programming a form (window) by hand can be challenging if you are not familiar with the language, so starting with a good form designer will help a lot.

Okay, it's now time for your first program!

== Application Windows Forms ==
Start up a Visual Basic .NET IDE and create a windows application.

Double click on the form to open up the code view.  You should see something similar to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Class Form1
    Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form

[Windows Form Designer generated code]

    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load

    End Sub
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;


Enter in the following code in the Form_Load Sub (between the &quot;Private Sub&quot; line and the &quot;End Sub&quot; line):

&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 MessageBox.Show(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This creates your classic &quot;Hello World!&quot; program.

Press F5 or go to the Debug menu and select Start to start the program. You should see an alert box that says &quot;Hello World!&quot; and then the main window (with nothing on it) should open. Click the &quot;X&quot; in the title bar like you would to quit any program!


== Application console ==
Add a new project via the menu ''File'', then ''New'', ''Project...'' and select ''Application console''.

Paste in the ''Main()'' function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
 Console.ReadLine()
&lt;/source&gt;

Now to avoid the program to automatically launch the previous paragraph form instead of the console, right click on the new ''ConsoleApplication1'' from the ''Solutions explorer'', and ''Set as starting project''.

Then the console appears when pressing F5.

== Basic symbols ==
As Visual Basic, VB.net uses:
# ' before comments
# _ to split a command on the next line
# : to start a new command on the same line

When adding code examples, please color it as it would appear in VB .NET. Use the font HTML Tags to do this. Example:

== Introduction ==
Visual Basic .NET is one of the two flagship languages (with C#) for the .NET framework from Microsoft. Despite being called Visual Basic, it is actually '''not''' backwards-compatible with VB6, and any code written in the old version will not compile under VB.NET.

As a language, Visual Basic.NET has the following traits:

'''Object-Oriented'''

As with all .NET languages, VB.NET includes full-blown support for object-oriented concepts, including simple inheritance. Everything in VB.NET is an object, including all of the primitives (Short, Integer, Long, String, Boolean, etc.) as well as types, events, and even assemblies. Everything inherits from the Object base class.

'''Event-Driven'''

All previous versions of Visual Basic were event-driven, but this feature is heavily enhanced under the .NET framework. Events are no longer recognized because they use a certain naming convention (ObjectName_EventName), but now are declared with a Handles ObjectName.EventName clause.  Event handlers can also be declared at runtime using the AddHandler command.

'''.NET Framework'''

As the name implies, VB.NET runs on top of Microsoft's .NET framework, meaning the language has full access to all of the supporting classes in the framework. It's also possible to run VB.NET programs on top of Mono, the open-source alternative to .NET, not only under Windows, but even Linux or Mac OSX.

'''Additional Features'''

As of version 10.0, VB.NET supports generics, anonymous classes, lambda functions, anonymous types, and other great features that make it a great language to learn and use.

==Getting Started==

'''Using Windows'''

If you do not have the full version of Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft provides free tools to create .NET applications using [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express| Visual Basic Express].  

'''Using Linux, Mac OSX'''

You can use [http://www.monodevelop.com MonoDevelop] with Linux, Mac OS, or Windows. Despite being limited in its support for all of the features of the language, it allows for cross platform development.

Step 1:  Go to the Alphabetical Listings. Click on &quot;Edit this page.&quot;  Locate the correct place to enter your school in alphabetical order.  Enter the following:  [[Guide to Schools/Alphabetical/&lt;Name of your school&gt;|&lt;Name of your school&gt;]] You must do this exactly. If not, either what appears on the page will be wrong or the link will not appear correctly.  Example: If the school you want to enter is &quot;Gateway Academy&quot; then your entry will be [[Guide to Schools/Gateway Academy|Gateway Academy]] 

Step 2: Click on &quot;Show Preview&quot; and see if this shows correctly.  The name of your school should now appear in red -- not blue -- in the proper location. Look for &quot;Gateway Academy&quot; in red. If it does not appear that way, click on &quot;cancel,&quot; and start over.  If it looks as it should, except that the name of your school is in red, not blue, click on &quot;Save Page.&quot;

Step 3: Now click on the link in red that you just created.  This brings you to a page with &quot;Guide to Schools/&lt;Name of your School&gt;&quot; at the top, and a notice that says &quot;You've followed a link to a page that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  
In the box below, enter in the upper left corner: {{subst:Template:School outline}}  and click &quot;show preview&quot;  Our template outline for a school description should have appeared.  If so, click &quot;Save page.&quot; If not, click &quot;Cancel and start over&quot; 

Step 4: Go back to Alphabetical listings, click on &quot;Edit this page&quot; highlight your entry of the name of the school and follow your computer's procedure for putting the entry into your copy buffer.    

Step 5:  Go to the appropriate place for your school to appear geographically and according to type of school.  Click on &quot;edit this page&quot; in each case, and paste the entry into the page as appropriate. 

At this point, you are done.  You have the name of your school entered nthree locations in this Wikibook and a template for entering information about your school in the format of other entries. --&gt;

'''''NOTE: This is the person (Tom Croke) who started this Wikibook.  In an email from Jimmy Wales today (March 7, 2003) I was warned that this Wikibook in this format might be subject to deletion if not converted into a format that is more obviously a textbook.  I will begin that task over the next few months, although I can't fully deliver on that as soon as might be desired. ''''' 

This Wikibook was started by [http://www.familylight.com Tom Croke of FamilyLight Educational Consulting] on October 29, 2005, in the hope of inspiring a comprehensive guide to schools and other related resources. On March 7, 2006, Tom was notified that the book needed to be converted to a textbook format in order to remain. Hopefully by the time you look at this, it will contain the collective wisdom of hundreds, perhaps thousands of parents, students, educators, psychologists, school and treatment facility officials, educational consultants, advocacy groups and others from all walks of life -- including much that is beyond the concept and the competence of the person who started this Wikibook. Hopefully at that time it will be usable as text in a class for parents learning to plan their children's education, for adults seeking to continue their education, and for professionals guiding educational planning.  Much of the reference material will remain as an appendix.  

As this book grows, it may be divided into several books, focusing on planning in various areas of education.  We'll start as one book and see how it grows.  

If you are planning to teach a course, hopefully this will be of use to you.  After you have used the book for that purpose, hopefully you and your students will discover ways to improve it and will make suggestions on the discussion page, or, better yet, dig in and make the improvements yourself. 

If you are struggling with planning someone's education, hopefully you can turn this into a self-taught course (and you to can improve on the book through your experience) 

If you are just looking for resources, the resource appendices will still be of help.  If you are thinking of contributing, contributors, know that you are welcome, no matter who you are or what your experience.  Please look at “Discussion” before you contribute so you know the thoughts and concerns of readers and of the contributors who came before you, and you can be aware of context as you proceed.   

Please also click on “Discussion” at the top of this page to comment on what you see, to offer suggestions and to learn the thinking behind this Wikibook.

Wikibooks requires that all contributions to these pages keep to a neutral point of view (NPOV).  There will be disagreement between contributors, and readers will sometimes benefit from knowing about it. Hopefully contributors who see something they don’t agree with will not edit that out but enter a comment of the form, “some people believe X and others believe Y.”  That keeps it neutral, but the alternative points of view are made visible to readers.

Hopefully you will all benefit from the accumulated wisdom here and you will also add to it from your own experience.

I originally intended to create a guidebook that others and other resources for young people that might expand in any direction involving information about schools. Jimmy Wales email of March 7, 2006, that we were subject to deletion if not more of a textbook changed my course.  

My own contributions to the Appendices will be primarily information for people looking for schools and other resources that provide special services for young people with behavioral and emotional problems. (That was initially intended to be the entirety of the book) I will write some pieces for the Textbook chapters, but the only one I have the knowledge to fully develop will be on special needs.  Contributions of others will be important in all areas. 

Others may expand this in other directions. 

To know about me, see http://www.familylight.com.  I would encourage other contributors to be consistent with the format I establish or to add to it.  I am not suggesting that others should not innovate -- that would be going against the purpose of wikibooks.  What I am asking is that we can maintain some consistency in how the data is listed.

==If you want to add a school to Appendix A ==
'''Contributors, please read!'''     

If you wish to add a school, please do as follows for sake of consistency: (I personally prefer that you log in first, but that is not required.) If you think you can improve this procedure, it is your privilege to do that under the rules of Wikibooks, but lets hope for a sense of collaboration among the contributors.  As time passes, I am sure there will be improvements on this suggested approach.  I encourage contributors to be familiar with the existing procedure before improving upon it. 

'''''BEFORE YOU START'''''  Decide where your entry link will go.  I am suggesting that every school or treatment resource have its own module, so the question is, where does it link?  If you are adding to a category of school that is not well developed, I suggest putting it on the main page under the heading for that category. Once a category develops ten or more links, I suggest creating a link for that category to separate module for that category with the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:School outline}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; substituted in the module.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''To add a separate module for a category:'''''  
&lt;br&gt;
'''step 1:''' Click on the edit symbol on the right side of the screen slightly above the name of the category you are working with.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;'''step 2:''' Change the name of the catgory to a link.  If the Category is &quot;Regular Schools,&quot; substitute &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[[Guide to Schools/Regular Schools |Regular Schools]]&quot; &lt;/nowiki&gt; where it currently says &quot;Regular Schools.&quot; If there are other symbols, such as quotation marks, leave them in place outside the brackets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; '''Step 3:'''  Click on &quot;Show Preview&quot;  This should produce exactly what was there before except the name of the category is now in red rather than black. If that is not true, click on &quot;cancel&quot; and start over.  If that is true, click on &quot;save page.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  '''Step 4:''' Now click on the category, now in red. This will bring up a page with a notice that says, &quot;You've followed a link to a page that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  The title of the page will be &quot;Guide to Schools/Regular Schools&quot; In the upper left corner of the space below enter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:States by Region}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Click on &quot;Show Preview.&quot; You should see the standard list of states organized by region.  If not, click cancel and start over. If so, click on &quot;save page.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; '''Step 5:'''Go back to Main Page. Now move the links already under your category to their proper location on the newly created page, whose name should now show in blue on the main page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''''To add a school:'''''

'''Step 1:'''  Open the edit or edit this page, then go to the place where you want to add the school to the site. Enter the following:  [[Guide to Schools/&lt;Name of your school&gt;|&lt;Name of your school&gt;]] You must do this exactly. If not, either what appears on the page will be wrong or the link will not appear correctly.  Example: If the school you want to enter is &quot;Gateway Academy&quot; then your entry will be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Guide to Schools/Gateway Academy|Gateway Academy]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Step 2:''' Click on &quot;Show Preview&quot; and see if this shows correctly.  The name of your school should now appear in red -- not blue -- in the proper location. Look for [[Guide to Schools/Gateway Academy|Gateway Academy]]. If it does not appear that way, click on cancel, and start over.  If it looks as it should, except that the name of your school is in red, not blue, click on &quot;Save Page.&quot;

'''Step 3:''' Now click on the link in red that you just created.  This brings you to a page with &quot;Guide to Schools/&lt;Name of your School&gt;&quot; at the top, and a notice that says &quot;You've followed a link to a page that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  
In the box below, enter in the upper left corner &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:School outline}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; and click &quot;show preview&quot;  Our template outline for a school description should have appeared.  If so, click &quot;Save page.&quot; If not, click &quot;Cancel and start over&quot;

1. Suppose in mod ''m'' arithmetic we know ''x'' &amp;ne; ''y'' and
:&lt;math&gt;y^2 \equiv x^2 \pmod{m} \!&lt;/math&gt;
find at least 2 divisors of ''m''.

2. Derive the formula for the Carmichael function, &amp;lambda;(''m'') = smallest number such that 
''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;(m)&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''m'').

3. Let ''p'' be prime such that ''p'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 for some positive integer ''s''. Show that if ''g'' is not a square in mod ''p'', i.e. there's no ''h'' such that ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''g'', then ''g'' is a generator mod ''p''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tourism Facts and Figures from the 2002 World Tourism Organization Report'''

•  Tourism is the world's largest industry, annual revenue approaching $500 billion.

•  Leisure accounts for 75% of all international travel

•  Tourism accounts for roughly 35 per cent of world exports of services and over 8 per cent of exports of goods

•  350 million people are directly or indirectly employed in tourism.

•  International tourist arrivals increased from 25 million in 1950 to 698 million in 2000, and are predicted to grow to 1.56 billion by 2020

'''Why is International Tourism Growing so Quickly?'''

•  People increasingly have more leisure time in most developed nations (not US and not in most developing countries) due to longer paid vacations and lower weekly work hours

•  Disposable income levels have been increasing worldwide, albeit faster in developed nations – in the UK citizens now spend 25% of their income on leisure – 5 times more than in 1960

•  Air travel costs have fallen 30% in 30 years

•  More media exposure to tourism via advertisers' images of exotic foreign locales

'''Goals of Conventional Tourism'''

•  Maximize comfort, travel value, relaxation, the diversity of sightseeing as to take in the most interesting and/or beautiful things as possible, and attempt to optimally fit the travel time into one's work and family schedule

•  This is dominant angle of analysis from the perspective of rational choice theory

'''Our Individual and Social Perceptions of Tourism'''

•  What images and concepts come to mind when thinking of tourism?

•  What are some common connotations associated with “taking a vacation” under different circumstances and in different locales? (status, deservedness, escapism)

•  If you have ever traveled internationally, how did you interact with the “locals”?

•  How did these encounters shape your perception of a certain nation or region?

•  What attracts people to a particular destination in the first place?

•  Common sense ideas about tourist travel and how to do it best vary between individuals and national groups, but there are some underlying patterns…

•  “Tourism” is just a name for a set of socially structured activities that we are guided through by how specific dimensions of race, class, gender, and politics figure into our specific cultural (and subcultural) models for appropriate behavior

It may seem pessimistic, but one of the best means to think of ways to improve a standard pattern of behavior is to attempt to criticize the manner in which it is currently done, that is, find all that you can think of that doesn't seem quite right with it, or that which is outright wrong by some ethical standard you would like to respect.

'''Structural Functionalist Perspective''' (how things are supposed to work)

•  What is an idealized set of ways for tourism to function optimally for all parties involved? How well is tourism functioning to tie the world together socially now?

•  Tourism should serve educational purposes by making people in one country or region aware of what life is like in another so they aren't ignorant of the realities of everyday life in other places - thus offering a two-way trade of perspectives involving diverse cultural knowledge that might give a new perspective on home

•  Tourism should bring people divided by national lines closer together for future international cooperation and to prevent conflict by integrating them into the day to day lives of another people (ex. EU sister cities)

•  Tourism should provide people with insights into how to improve life back home

•  Tourism should redistribute wealth from an ever growing number of people from wealthier countries visiting poorer ones in order to help them to “develop” and fight off poverty

•  Travel is supposed to build character by forcing people to adapt new strategies in unfamiliar foreign territory

'''Conflict Perspective''' (how things [intentionally] don't work out so well for the less advantaged)

•  Only the world's wealthier people can afford to engage in conventional tourism at all and everyone is somehow restricted as to how extravagant or wide their travels can by race, class, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability, amount of free time, or global political situation

•  Thus, tourism between richer and poorer nations is a very one-way exchange of services rendered to the privileged tourist by less privileged people

•  Tourism tends to exoticize and commodify the “authentic” cultural activities of another group of people, which inevitably degrades and alters the traditional meanings of these rituals

•  Money allows wealthier people to escape the reality of their lives to see people who cannot afford to escape the often harsh reality of theirs - looking at poverty has become a popular part of travel, perhaps allowing us to and look and feel grateful for the fate they have escaped and perhaps change class to be “peasant for a day”

•  Big multinational corporations eventually edge out native local businesses that sell the more lucrative tourism related products and services especially since tourists on the whole are more likely to trust home brand names

•  You can get away with treating people worse in poor countries that you cannot back home ex. sex tourism

'''Symbolic Interactionist Critique''' (how interaction patterns betray deeper meanings)

•  Tourism can be quite an ugly thing when there are great wealth disparities between tourists and local peoples because of the nasty feelings of inherent superiority and inferiority between the servers and the served. What is worse is that some people go for this kind of “super [feudal] service” especially

•  I think most people instinctively feel this kind of relationship is wrong but are almost forced by their almost inescapable involvement in it to somehow justify their participation in such an ugly set of interactions by instinctively devaluing the “others” status as a equal human being via a self-serving bias

•  Poverty is often romantically portrayed in tourist marketing and “natives” impoverished lifestyles are chosen rather than the outcome of often violent historical oppression

•  Tourism is part of an interpersonal status competition whereby conspicuous consumption in evidenced by pictures, videos, stories, or artifacts from exotic locales one has visited.

•  Most of the time, when visiting foreign lands, there is only a very small amount of interaction occurring outside of economic transactions due to language barriers - very few people would think it logical to make significant efforts since our time abroad is minimal and we expect many foreigners to speak our language

•  Most tourists' travels take them only on highly trafficked preset tourist routes past old buildings and natural wonders and then back to their hotels, maybe after immersing themselves in the local sociohistorical context only by eating “traditional” food in upscale restaurants created for tourists – this commodification cheapens the experience by making it unauthentic and predictable, especially in touristically “themed” places

•  Conventional tourism is a series of very passive exercises, but people try to offset the feeling of being a pure spectator by photographing and videotaping as much of their experience as possible

'''Environmental Critique''' - tourism is currently very unsustainable due to a high reliance on fossil fuels for extensive travel back and forth over long distances for short periods of time and for providing very comfortable and spectacular accommodation for tourists in the way of luxury hotels, often constructed in ecologically sensitive areas.

To move beyond critical analysis, we need to think creatively about ways to improve current behavior patterns, but first, we need look at all the currently available options before starting to formulate our own solutions…

So, here are some examples of non traditional means of tourism…

Skill/Language Acquisition Tourism, Ecotourism, Developmental Services Tourism, Student/Professional Exchange Tourism, Religious Missionary Tourism, Athletic Exercise/Deprivation Tourism, etc…

'''What does all of this say about our society?'''

We have institutionalized a societal desire for regularly scheduled breaks with normality that has taken the form of tourism. Some may criticize this as an attempted escape from either the rigors or boredom of modern life. Others might say this has taken the place of other institutions from the past such as religious pilgrimages or extended festivals originally based on seasonal solstices or equinoxes (now in the form of mass summer vacations). Possibly the most revealing part of the tourist experience are the so called “cults of authenticity”. Most excursions are planned as great searches for one type of authentic experience or another, e.g. the wilderness experience, the primitive culture experience, the historical experience, the paradise experience. The great irony of these quests is that people don't realize that when this type of nostalgic mentality is propagated and embraced on today's larger social scale, it dashes the hopes of anyone finding that kind of authenticity amongst the hordes of people chasing similar imagery. When modern people reach en mass for one form of authenticity or another, they find their dreams badly distorted by the sheer quantity of others pursuing it.

'''My recommendations for the future of tourism…'''

•  The average length of tourist travels is too short and this is a problem from a resource overuse perspective and from the perspective of actually trying to integrate yourself in a local society to make a deeper attempt to understand and how it works differently than your own. The problem is that this is a direct result of people working more and not having as much consolidated vacation time, although most Europeans get six weeks

•  One of my personal suggestions for the future of tourism is to advise travelers to try to spend as little money as possible, because it seems luxury only puts up more barriers from the average lives of the population

•  I suggest using the following ideas to bring yourselves in contact with local people – eat at local restaurants and at local markets, use ride sharing programs to get around the country (ex. Mitzfahrcenrale in German speaking countries), and share accommodation with locals (couchsurfing.com or globalfreeloaders.org) - see my article on hospitality services in Wikipedia.

•  Do something traveling that is not “you centered”, that is, do something nice for other people in the country, the only problem is that most aid-giving programs involve too lengthy a commitment for most tourists

•  Also, what I think makes more and more tourism destructively fake is the increasing involvement of large foreign corporations over the past 30 years and their homogenization of the tourist experience – shun them!

•  Tourism experiences should be put more in the hands of locals to build more fair and respectful exchanges

'''Material below drawn from Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel''' – his thesis goes something like this…

Different natural environments allow societies to take up more advanced social organization at different times…

''Why has there been such a great historical divides of power between different peoples in the world? Then and Now…

Why did peoples from Europe end up conquering the entire world and not Africans, Native Americans, or the Chinese?

Human history has been and remains an ongoing story of unequal conflicts between the haves and the havents… Why?

The victors tend to rely on racial, cultural, or even religious explanations, but this is the easy and self-serving way out!

I say the factors responsible for today's global inequities are 70% environmental, 10% cultural, and 20% exploitative.''

'''The biggest advantage in human history = hunter gatherers changing into agriculturalists'''

•  Farmers get 10 to 100 times more food than hunter-gatherers per acre of land by utilizing plant/animal domesticates

•  Agriculture – stationary societies – big food surpluses – dense populations – military advantage by numbers – leaders to administer social hierarchy and resources – specialists in technology/culture produce novel ideas

'''Why did this happen at different times in different places around the world?'''

•  There are relatively few plants and animals in the world that we have found suitable for domestication

•  300,000 wild plant species – 3000 eaten by humans – 300 domesticated – 12 account for 80% of the world's total food crop tonnage annually – wheat, corn, rice, soybean, potato, banana, and sugarcane are 60%

•  We haven't succeeded in domesticating another major food crop to displace any in the top 12 in 500 years

•  Of the 150 big mammals (100 lbs.) in the world that could be used extensively for protein (meat, milk, eggs), transportation, or as beasts of burden working with human inventions (plow) only 14 have been domesticated

•  Keep in mind there is a difference in taming animals and changing them en mass to sustainable domesticates

•  Resistance comes from diet, low growth rates, captive breeding problems, danger (panic), and social structure

'''Which people got lucky and which did not? Where and Why?'''

•  Remember Mesopotamia a.k.a. “the fertile crescent” – well, the region of Southwestern Eurasia had huge advantages

•  The sheep, goat, cow, and pig were all successfully domesticated there 10,000 years ago – the horse later

•  Of the world's total distribution of wild, large seeded grass species that later became the world's bread basket of domesticated cereal crops (wheat, barley, etc.) Western Eurasia had 70% – many were especially easy to grow (self-pollinating annuals) and had relatively high protein content compared with corn, rice, or yams

•  Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, and Australia had few domesticatable plant/animal species in comparison

•  They did indeed have some, but to spark the huge transition from the hunter gatherer lifestyle we all lived in for homo sapiens' first 10 million years on Earth to the agriculturalist lifestyle we almost all now embrace took a solid demonstration of the rewards of this new lifestyle – it had to come in package deals involving a larger diversity of plant and animal species than most peoples had or could acquire by trade with neighbors

'''Why did Agriculture and its Associated Innovations Spread Faster to Some Places?'''

•  Once trade among fledgling agriculturalists could get started, along with it came tech/culture innovation

•  However, trade routes could only be through navigable terrain and the innovations had to work in both places

•  This was not possible for people that in remote areas where oceans, deserts, or mountains had to be crossed

•  Furthermore, crops and animals domesticated in one place were only suitable for use in regions with similar climates. This was easy across Eurasia with its wide open latitudes, but difficult for the Americas, Africa, and Australia, where predominantly north/south orientations and equatorial divides separate similar climates.

•  Thus, it took much longer for viable agricultural packages to be spread and assembled in these places, for instance, it took thousands of years longer in Mesoamerica to get the balanced corn, beans, squash “trinity”

'''The Greatest Weapon in European Conquest – Early Germ Warfare'''

•  It is believed that at least 90% of the deaths occurring in early European conquest were due to disease

•  The roots of many diseases that killed millions of indigenous peoples in the Americas, Australia, and Polynesia can be traced back to Eurasians living for millennia in close proximity with domesticated animals

•  Examples = measles, tuberculosis, smallpox from cattle, most influenzas from pigs, malaria from fowl

•  This isn't just a one-way street, tropical and foreign diseases have devastated Eurasian populations at many times in history and impeded colonial efforts in the tropics, but the losses have been much greater for others

      <text xml:space="preserve">Usually create variables that will represent certain data types that you want to represent or simulate in your program in comparison to the particular problem needing to be solved or real world simulation-i.e. the basis for your program

Then create or use function/methods that you want your program to preform in order to achieve a specific tasks or real world simulation.

This is usually done in block methods or modules, in which you encapsulate or wrap all 
necessary data (representations) and methods (and arguments/parameters) into an object / 
class, which best simulates the basis of what the program is supposed to represent...this is turn is called generating code.

''This American Life'' - Simulated Worlds [http://www.thislife.org/ra/38.ram] - Civil war reenactments, wax museums, simulated coal mines, fake ethnic restaurants, an ersatz Medieval castle and other re-created worlds that thrive all across America.
Act One. National Tour. Host Ira Glass uses Italian author Umberto Eco's essay &quot;Travels in Hypereality&quot; as a guidebook to American simulated worlds. Eco says that the urge to create these miniature simulated worlds is a very American impulse--a significant American aesthetic--and one that's not often discussed. Ira visits the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, plays clips from Jessica Yu's documentary on Civil War reenactors (called Men of Reenaction and available from the Independent Television Service at 800/343-4727), stops by a fake coal mine under Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, and discusses &quot;the poor man's Hearst Castle&quot;--a California hotel called the Madonna Inn. (17 minutes)
Act Two. Dinosaur Exhibit. Writer Jack Hitt discovers that the world of dinosaurs is a man-made creation, a simulated world that may or may not accurately reflect what happened on earth 100 million years ago. Talking with dinosaur experts like Jack Horner (the dinosaur expert whose work was the basis of much of the film Jurassic Park Hitt finds that most of what you think you know about dinosaurs is probably wrong, and that Americans' ideas about dinosaurs go through fashions--fashions that reflect the national mood. We believed dinosaurs were more aggressive when we were on the brink of World Wars One and Two. And these days we focus on their family values. (13 minutes)
Act Three. Medieval Times. Ira takes a Medieval scholar from the University of Chicago, Michael Camille, to Medieval Times – a chain of fake castles where visitors eat Medieval food and drink Medieval Pepsi and watch a supposed recreation of a Medieval jousting tournament. The scholar finds that there are many historical inaccuracies, but that Medieval Times does capture something essential and interesting about the spirit of the Middle Ages. (19 minutes)
Act Four. Simulating Reality on Morning Edition. Ira Glass worked for NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered for 17 years, and shares a few thoughts on the devices he and his colleagues used to simulate the real world on those shows. (2 minutes)

      <text xml:space="preserve">•  This article was written for a volume in which all other contributors were promoting the view that culture is the primary factor inhibiting the development of poor nations across the world – they don't believe that environmental factors, imperialism, or racism can adequately explain the persistent global wealth inequities

•  Instead, they blame counterproductive cultural values for a range of ills in the underdeveloped world – political corruption, human rights violations, lagging innovation, protectionist economic policies, etc.

•  A US example of these ideas is how some would explain different upward social mobility in different minority groups eg. African-Americans and Hispanic immigrants vs. Asian immigrants

•  Those who don't buy into culture-based explanations for these phenomena would instead point to different factors including broad historical disadvantages, discrimination, and an exploitative political economy

•  Since both of these perspectives show merit, most people will opt to try approaches from both angles and hope that some sort of combination of strategies will result in these poor folks living more like us (“better”)

•  Richard Shweder is uncomfortable with this kind of reasoning, which he sees as a distinctly Western thought process leading towards the decimation of a diversity of cultural perspectives on different “right ways to live”

'''Think about these thought Provoking Questions on the Role of Culture and Cultural Criticism'''

•  How do we measure the goodness of a society and its culture?

•  Should “good” cultures concede to change with the times in order to maximize their advantage over others?

•  How rational should or could any culture be in its outlook towards itself and others?

•  Can cultures remain diversified along traditional lines or is this an outdated and/or quickly vanishing ideal?

•  Do we have cultural “goals” in mind for the future or do we mostly focus on avoiding bad outcomes now?

Does cannibalism have nutritional value or is it just a form of high cuisine? Although this question is a topic of solemn debate in anthropology, at grand ceremonial occasions anthropologists are known to have a sense of humor. Being an anthropologist, I thought I would begin this chapter with an admittedly baroque variation on an old joke about the market for brains in Papua New Guinea .

This guy from the &quot; First World &quot; walks into a gourmet food store in Papua New Guinea . He goes to the meat section, where he sees a bill of fare designated &quot;assorted westerners.&quot; It contains two general offerings: evangelical missionaries (religious and secular), who think it is their mission in life to make our world a better place by their moral lights, and romantic relativists, who think whatever is, is okay and actually seem to like it here. He notices many delicacies, all neatly arranged in bins.

The first bin has a sign that says &quot;Economists' Brains from the World Bank: $2.39 a Pound!&quot; The label on the bin reads, &quot;These people want to loan us lots of money at very favorable rates (which of course we are never going to pay back), if only we will do things more like the way they do things in the West. They want us to formalize contracts, create an independent judi­ciary, and prohibit the preferential hiring of members of one's own ethnic group. And that's just for starters.&quot;

The sign on the second bin says &quot;Protestant Ethicists' Brains: $2.42 a Pound.&quot; The label reads, &quot;These people want us to change our work habits and our ideas about the good life. They want us to stop wasting our time on elaborate rituals for dead ancestors. They want to loan us lots of money at very favorable rates (which of course we are never going to pay back), if only we will start thinking about things the way they think about things in Western World (or at least in the very northern sections of the West). Western folk are convinced that everything is nefarious except the impersonal pursuit of work and that only the rich will be saved. They tell us that 'sustainable growth' is the contemporary code word for the adoption of Protestant values. They believe that God blesses men in the sign of their material prosperity, especially their purposefully amassed wealth. They want us to be saved. They want to save us.&quot;

The sign on the third bin says &quot;Monocultural Feminists' [this refers to feminists who believe that gender equality should be imposed internationally] Brains: $2.49 a Pound.&quot; The label reads, &quot;These people want us to change our family life, gender relations, and reproductive practices. They want us to devalue the womb, which is associated in their minds with 'bad' things such as big families, domesticity, and a sexual division of labor. They want us to revalue the clitoris [this refers to Western outrage at the practice of female genital mutilation], which to Westerners is associated in with 'good' things such as independence, equality, and hedonic self-stimulation) as the biological essence of female identity, and as the symbol and means of female emancipation from men. And they want NATO to send in a 'humanitarian' invasion force unless we promise to join the National Organization of Women and the League of Women Voters.&quot;

The sign on the final bin says &quot;Anthropologists' Brains: $15.00 a Pound.&quot; The label reads, &quot;These people think we should just take the money and run!&quot; Dismayed, our visitor walks over to the guy behind the counter and he says, &quot;What's this! Haven't you heard about the moral superiority of the West (or at least of the northernmost sections of the West)? Don't you know that the reason we [in the ' First World '] are better than you [in the ' Third World '] is that we are humanists who endorse the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Man? Don't you know that when it comes to brains there is basic oneness to humankind? Don't you know that the major reason for differences in the world [variations in 'human capital'] is that people in the southern sections of the globe grow up in impoverished cultures ['cultures of poverty']? That is why they are badly equipped for life on the infor­mation highway and in the global fast lane. That is why they are untrustwor­thy, corrupt, undisciplined, unskilled, and poor. Okay, I can understand a slight difference in price for economists' brains, Protestant ethicists' brains, and monocultural feminists' brains ($2.39 a pound/$2.42 a pound/$2.49 a pound), but $15.00 a pound for anthropologist's brains? That's ridiculous! It's illogical! It's unfair! It defies 'transparency'!&quot; The guy behind the counter replies: &quot;Do you know how many anthropologists we had to kill before we could find a pound of brains?&quot;

So I admit to feeling a bit brainless writing for a volume whose contributors include so many distinguished scholars and evangelists from disciplines other than my own. Lawrence Harrison recruited me to this effort by stating, with characteristic candor, that he wanted me to write as a skeptic and critic because he thought I believed in &quot;culture&quot; but not in &quot;progress.&quot; He said that he was planning to invite other types of skeptics and critics as well, such as those who believe in &quot;progress&quot; but not in &quot;culture.&quot; I do believe in progress, at least in a limited sense (more on that below). And I suspect that the precise sense in which I believe in culture (more on that too) may not seem very helpful (or even sensible) to those who have ar­gued here that &quot;culture matters.&quot;

What does it mean to say that &quot;culture matters?&quot; It depends on who is speaking. The theme of this volume is expressive of an intellectual stance known as &quot;cultural developmentalism.&quot; For a cultural developmentalist, the assertion that &quot;culture matters&quot; is a way of saying that some cultures are im­poverished or backward, whereas others are enriched or advanced. It means there are good things in life (e.g., health, domestic tranquillity, justice, mate­rial prosperity, hedonic self-stimulation, and small families) that all human beings ought to want and have but that their culture keeps them from wanting and/or having.

Here is how you can tell if you are a cultural developmentalist. Do you like to inspect the globe with an ethical microscope and draw &quot;moral maps&quot; of the world [this refers to Lawrence Harrison's &quot;Clash of Civilization&quot; Thesis]? Or, doing what amounts to pretty much the same thing, do you like to construct &quot;quality of life&quot; indicators that can be used to rank cultures, civilizations, and religions from better to worse? If you are a cultural devel­opmentalist, you probably feel deeply disturbed by the staying power and popularity of various (&quot;archaic&quot;) ways of life and (&quot;superstitious&quot;) systems of belief because you think they are relatively devoid of truth, goodness, beauty, or practical efficiency. You probably want to &quot;enlighten&quot; the resi­dents of the &quot;dark continents&quot; of the world. You probably want to lift them up from error, ignorance, bad habits, immorality, and squalor, and refashion them to be more progressive, more democratic, more scientific, more civic-minded, more industrious, more entrepreneurial, more reliable, more rational, and more like (the ideal) us. Culture matters for me too but in a rather different sort of way… If I were ever to refer to a &quot;culture of poverty,&quot; I would probably reserve the expression for ascetic communities in which the renunciation of wealth and the re­pudiation of worldly goods had been positively valued as an objective good. Furthermore, given my conception of precisely how culture counts, I might even try to find some merit in that conception of the good.

Although the idea of an &quot;impoverished culture&quot; is not exactly an oxy­moron, it has played almost no part in my own field research. To make mat­ters worse, my commitment to the very idea of &quot;culture&quot; has its source in an interest in other cultures as sources of illumination (Shweder 1991, 1993, 1996a, 1996b, 1997; Shweder et al. 1998). I have never put much stock in the view that holds that a good reason for becoming interested in other cul­tures is that they are impediments to the realization of some imagined univer­sal aspiration of all people to be more like northern Europeans. And while I certainly believe in the importance and moral decency of our way of life, I do not believe in our moral superiority over all the rest. 2

Thus I do not think that northern Europeans have a corner on the market for human progress. I do not believe that cognitive, spiritual, ethical, social, political, and material progress go hand in hand. Societies in command of great wealth and power can be spiritually, ethically, socially, and politically flawed. Many vital, intellectually sophisticated, and admirable cultures, places where philosophers live in mud huts, have evolved in environments with rudimentary technology and relatively little material wealth. Hence, I do not believe that either &quot;we&quot; or &quot;they&quot; have implemented the only credible manifestation of the good life. Obviously, I am one of the heretics at this revival meeting and it is not the greatest of feelings. So let me continue my presentation with a couple of con­fessions, which will perhaps reduce some of my anxiety over being drafted as a designated skeptic.

 

CONFESSION 1: I AM AN ANTHROPOLOGIST

My first confession, of course, is that I am an anthropologist. Unfortunately, given all the turmoil in the profession of anthropology these days, this con­fession is not very informative. It carries no implications (as it would have fifty years ago or even twenty years ago) for how I might feel about the con­cept of culture, whether I am for it or against it or whether it makes me laugh or cry. 3 For the sake of accuracy in describing the current scene in anthropology, let me note that there was a time in anthropology when such words as &quot;primitive,&quot; &quot;barbarian,&quot; &quot;savage,&quot; or even &quot;underdeveloped&quot; were put in quotation marks, if they were used at all. There was a time when the idea that there is only one way to lead a morally decent and rational life, and it's our way, would have been seen, quite frankly, as obscene.

But things have changed. Monocultural feminism has put an end to any facile relativism in anthropology and has given a new meaning to the idea of &quot;political correctness.&quot; So, along with the international human rights move­ment and various agencies promoting Western-style globalization (UNICEF, WHO, perhaps even NATO), there are plenty of anthropologists these days who take an interest in other cultures mainly as objects of scorn. The slogan &quot;It is not cultural, it's [fill in the blank: criminal, immoral, corrupt, ineffi­cient, barbaric]&quot; (or alternatively, &quot;It is cultural and it's [fill in the blank: criminal, immoral, corrupt, inefficient, barbaric]&quot;) has become the rallying cry for cultural developmentalists, Western interventionists of all kinds, and some schools of cultural anthropology as well.

I regret this ironic turn of events. Cultural anthropology was once a disci­pline that was proud of its opposition to ethnocentric misunderstanding and moral arrogance as well as its anti-colonial defense of other ways of life. That was yesteryear. These days there are plenty of anthropologists (the post-culturalists) who want to disown the concept of culture. They think the word &quot;culture&quot; gets used in bad faith to defend authoritarian social arrangements and to allow despots to literally get away with murder. Indeed, as the world of theory in cultural anthropology turns, it seems to be &quot;deja vu all over again.&quot; Despite a century of objections by anthropological pluralists, relativists, and contex-tualists such as Franz Boas, Ruth Benedict, Melville Herskovits, Robert LeVine, Clifford Geertz, and others, an intellectual stance reminiscent of late nineteenth-century &quot;white man's burden,&quot; cultural developmentalism is back. The self-congratulatory, up-from-barbarism theme of (certain versions of) Western liberalism (including the sensational accusation that African mothers are bad mothers, human rights violators, and mutilators of their daughters) has once again become fashionable on the anthropological scene, at least among those anthropologists who are the most politically correct. 4 The current scene within anthropology is sufficiently complex (and per­verse) that there are even anthropologists who think they own the concept of &quot;culture&quot; but do not want anyone, including themselves, to do anything with it. I am not one of them. Regardless of whether the idea of culture makes me laugh or cry, I like it a lot. I can't get rid of it. I find we can't live by ecu­menism alone. Membership in some particular tradition of meanings is an essential condition for personal identity and individual happiness. In my view, &quot;thick ethnicity&quot; and cultural diversity both have their place and are part of the natural and moral order of things. I do not think Mother Nature wants everyone to be alike.

What do I mean by &quot;culture&quot;? I mean community-specific ideas about what is true, good, beautiful, and efficient. To be &quot;cultural,&quot; those ideas about truth, goodness, beauty, and efficiency must be socially inherited and customary; and they must actually be constitutive of different ways of life. Alternatively stated, culture refers to what Isaiah Berlin called &quot;goals, val­ues and pictures of the world&quot; that are made manifest in the speech, laws, and routine practices of some self-monitoring group. There is a lot more packed into that definition than I can unpack in a sin­gle chapter. There is the notion that actions speak louder than words and that &quot;practices&quot; are a central unit for cultural analysis. That is one reason I don't much like value questionnaires and find it hard to feel enthusiastic about research based on the analysis of official creeds or on endorsement patterns for abstract stand-alone propositions. 5

Furthermore, one of the things &quot;culture&quot; is certainly not about is &quot;national character.&quot; I am not going to have much to say about &quot;national character&quot; studies here, but they went out of fashion about forty years ago, and for good reason. They went out of fashion because it is far better to think about human behavior and motivation the way rational choice theorists or sensible economists do, rather than the way personality theorists do. Rational choice theorists think about action as something emanating from &quot;agency.&quot; That is to say, action is analyzed as the joint product of &quot;preferences&quot; (including goals, values, and &quot;ends&quot; of various sorts) and &quot;constraints&quot; (including &quot;means&quot; of various sorts, such as causal beliefs, information, skills, and ma­terial and non-material resources), all mediated by the will of rational beings.

This stands in contrast to the way in which personality theorists think about behavior. Personality theorists think about action as &quot;forced.&quot; They try to explain action as the joint product of two types of vectors, one pushing from &quot;inside,&quot; called &quot;person&quot; (described in terms of generalized motives and &quot;sticky&quot; global traits), and the other pushing from &quot;outside,&quot; called &quot;situa­tion.&quot; Looking for types of persons as a way of explaining cultural practices has not proved very useful. If one tries to characterize individuals in terms of per­sonality traits or generalized motives, one usually discovers that &quot;individuals within cultures vary much more among themselves than they do from indi­viduals in other cultures&quot; (Kaplan 1954). One also discovers that if there is any modal type at all (e.g., an &quot;authoritarian personality type&quot; or a personal­ity type with a &quot;need for achievement&quot;), it is typically characteristic of no more than about one-third of the population. It has long been recognized among psychological anthropologists and cultural psychologists that (quot­ing Melford Spiro 1961) &quot;it is possible for different modal personality sys­tems to be associated with similar social systems, and for similar modal personality systems to be associated with different social systems.&quot; Looking for types of personalities to explain differences in cultural practices is a dead end (see Shweder 1991).

 

CONFESSION 2: I AM A PLURALIST

My second confession is that I am a cultural pluralist. My version of cultural pluralism begins with a universal truth, which I refer to as the principle of “confusionism.&quot; A &quot;confusionist&quot; believes that the knowable world is in­complete if seen from any one point of view, incoherent if seen from all points of view at once, and empty if seen from &quot;nowhere in particular.&quot; Given the choice between incompleteness, incoherence, and emptiness, I opt for incompleteness while staying on the move between different ways of seeing and valuing the world.

This version of cultural pluralism is not opposed to universalism. Culture theorists do not divide into only two types, those who believe that anything goes (the &quot;radical relativists&quot;) and those who believe that only one thing goes (the &quot;uniformitarian universalists&quot;). I strongly believe in &quot;universalism,&quot; but the type of universalism I believe in is &quot;universalism without the uniformity,&quot; which is what makes me a pluralist. In other words, I believe there are uni­versally binding values but that there are just too many of them (e.g., justice, beneficence, autonomy, sacrifice, liberty, loyalty, sanctity, duty).

I believe that those objectively valuable ends of life are diverse, heterogeneous, irreducible to some common denominator such as &quot;utility&quot; or &quot;pleasure,&quot; and that they are inherently in conflict with each other. I believe that all the good things in life can't be simultaneously maximized, I believe that when it comes to imple­menting true values there are always trade-offs, which is why there are differ­ent traditions of values (i.e., cultures) and why no one cultural tradition has ever been able to honor everything that is good. 6 Cultural pluralism has other implications, some of which are highly provocative. For example, there is the claim that the members of the execu­tive board of the American Anthropological Association did the right and courageous thing in 1947 when they decided not to endorse the U.N. Decla­ration of the Rights of Man on the grounds that it was an ethnocentric docu­ment. In 1947, anthropologists were still proud of their anti-colonial defense of alternative ways of life (see Shweder 1996b).

 

PROGRESS AND PLURALISM: CAN THEY COEXIST?

Pluralism does not imply the rejection of the ideas of progress and decline. Progress means having more and more of something that is &quot;desirable&quot; (i.e., something that should be desired because it is &quot;good&quot;). Decline means hav­ing less and less of it. Name a specific &quot;good&quot; (e.g., taking care of parents in old age, eliminating contagious disease), and we can make objective judg­ments about progress with respect to that &quot;good.&quot; If maximizing the likeli­hood of child survival during the first nine months after birth is the measure of success, then the United States is objectively more advanced than Africa and India. If maximizing the likelihood of child survival during the first nine months after conception (in the womb) is the measure of success, then Africa and India (where abortion rates are relatively low) are objectively more ad­vanced than the United States (where abortion rates are relatively high).

Of course there is much that is discretionary (i.e., not dictated by either logic or evidence) in any decision about how to name and identify specific &quot;goods&quot; and thus morally map the world. For example, the sheer quantity of life, or &quot;reproductive fitness,&quot; is the measure used by evolutionary biologists for estimating the success of a population. By that measure of success (the ge­netic reproduction of one's tribe or ancestral line) how are we to evaluate the birth control pill, the legalization of abortion, and the reduction of family size in the high-tech societies of the First World ? Do we narrate a story of decline? Or, to select a second example, what type of story should we tell about &quot;quality of life&quot; measures such as life expectancy at birth? The longer lived a population, the greater the frequency of chronic illness, the greater the likeli­hood of functional impairment, and hence the higher the aggregate amount of pain (a true qualitative measure) experienced by that population. Good things (e.g., more years of life, no physical pain) do not always correlate. A longer life is not unambiguously a better life, or is it? Or, if longevity is a measure of success, then why not also numerousness or sheer population size, with China and India at the top of the list?

And why life expectancy at birth? What principle of logic or canon of in­ductive science dictates that standard for drawing moral maps and for assess­ing cultural progress? Why not life expectancy at age forty or, for that matter, at conception? Why not take the more comprehensive life-course perspective of the fetus and not just its later viewpoint as a newly born infant? As noted, if one considers the hazards of the womb the First World and former Second World look worse off than many societies in Africa and Asia. Consider how different our life expectancy tables would be if we factored in the 20 to 25 percent abortion rates in the United States and Canada or the 50-plus per-cent abortion rates in Russia, as compared to rates as low as 2 to 10 percent in India, Tunisia, and some other parts of the &quot;underdeveloped&quot; world.

The pro-life/pro-choice debate (I am pro-choice) is not the issue here. The issue is the discretionary aspect of moral mapping and the degrees of free­dom one has in deciding whose ideals are going to be selected as the gold standard of the good life. As societies become technologically sophisticated, rates of abortion often rise, thereby lowering the life expectancy rate of the population (assuming that life expectancy is calculated from the point of conception rather than at birth). In some parts of the world, often in those parts of the world where reproductive success and large families are valued, early childhood is a relatively dangerous time of life. In other places, often in high-tech places where small families are valued and the womb is no longer thought of as a sanctified ground, the real dangers come earlier in life, and if you-are an unwanted child, the womb can be hazardous to your health.

Once a particular &quot;good&quot; is selected and named, objective assessments of advance and decline can be made. That type of value-specific assessment is quite different, however, from any form of triumphal progressivism, which tries to pick out some one cultural tradition as superior to all the rest. Things can be made to seem either better or worse, depending on the criteria of value that you choose to select. When it comes to reviewing all the many po­tentially good things in life, cultural pluralists believe that there are pluses and minuses to most long-standing cultural traditions (see Shweder et al. 1997). And when it comes to constructing narratives about progress, they be­lieve that there is lots of room for discretion (and ideology) in how one tells the story of who is better and who is worse.

It is also possible to make such value-specific judgments about progress without believing in the overall superiority of the present over the past, or that most changes are for the good. It is even possible to make criterion-specific judgments of progress and decline while being a &quot;neo-antiquarian,&quot; that is, someone who rejects the idea that the world woke up, emerged from darkness, and became good for the first time yesterday or three hundred years ago in northern Europe . A &quot;neo-antiquarian&quot; does not think that new­ness is a measure of progress and is quite prepared, in the name of progress, to revalue things from distant places and from out of the distant past.

Pluralists do make critical judgments. Indeed, the &quot;stance of justification&quot; is so central to my style of cultural analysis that I would define a &quot;genuine&quot; culture, a culture deserving of appreciation, as a way of life that is defensible in the face of criticism from abroad. Pluralism is the attempt to provide that defense of &quot;others,&quot; and not only as a corrective to the partiality and exag­gerations of various modern forms of ethnocentrism and chauvinism (includ­ing the claim that the West is better than all the rest), although that is reason enough. Right now, with the fall of communism and the rise of global capi­talism, including the expansion of our Internet, we (in the West) feel full of ourselves. It is at times such as these that we might do well to remember that Max Weber, the author of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, did not voice a preference for Protestantism over Catholicism or for the North over the South. He was a critical pluralist who put out warnings about the &quot;iron cage&quot; of modernity, about the impersonal rules of the bureaucratic state that redefine one's moral obligations to kith and kin as a form of &quot;cor­ruption,&quot; and about the hazards of an unbridled economic rationality.

Throughout history, whoever is wealthiest and the most technologically advanced thinks that their way of life is the best, the most natural, the God-given, the surest means to salvation, or at least the fast lane to well-being in this world. In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries to China be­lieved that their invention of clocks, of which they were very proud, was knock-down proof of the superiority of Catholicism over other world reli­gions (Landes 1998, 336-337). For all I know, their mechanical timepiece may have been counted as an argument in favor of absolute monarchy. Daz­zled by our contemporary inventions and toys (e.g., CNN, IBM, Big Mac, blue jeans, the birth control pill, the credit card) and at home in our own way of life, we are prone to similar illusions and the same type of conceits.

 

MILLENNIAL PROPHECIES: THREE IMAGES OF THE &quot;NEW WORLD ORDER&quot;

These are confusing times, especially when one tries to imagine the broad outlines of the &quot;new world order&quot; that is likely to replace the old capitalist/ communist/underdeveloped &quot;three worlds&quot; scheme. One reason for the confusion is that the self-congratulatory, &quot;enlighten­ment&quot; origin story about the ascent of secularism, individualism, and science has taken its lumps in the 1990s and may not be all that useful for predicting the direction of change in the early twenty-first century. Thirty years ago, many social scientists predicted that, in the modern world, religion would go away and be replaced by science. They predicted that tribes would go away and be replaced by individuals. They were wrong. That has not and will not happen, either globally or locally. Multiculturalism is a fact of life. The for­mer Second World , once an empire, is now many little worlds. The develop­ment of a global world system and the emergence of local ethnic or cultural revival movements seem to go hand in hand. At the limit, political succession may even have its rewards for cultural minority groups. The potential re­wards include direct receipt of financial aid and military protection from var­ious power centers, and perhaps even a voice at the United Nations. Moreover, many of us now live in nation-states composed, as Joseph Raz has put it, &quot;of groups and communities with diverse practices and beliefs, in­cluding groups whose beliefs are inconsistent with each other.&quot; We will con­tinue to do so, if for no other reason than the reality of global migration and the fact that community and divinity are essential goods and must be ac­knowledged for the sake of individual identity and human progress. Of course, life in such a world can be hazardous, especially for members of im­migrant or minority groups living in multicultural states or for members of different civilizations or cultures who are in geopolitical conflict. In such a world, one hopes that it is not just culture that matters but also a particular pluralistic conception of culture because the right conception of culture can be useful in minimizing some of the risks associated with &quot;difference&quot; and with multicultural life.

There is a second reason these are confusing times. It would be nice to have in hand a valid general causal explanation for the wealth and poverty of peoples, cultures, or nations, but we don't. If by &quot;causation&quot; we mean what J. S. Mill meant by it—all the necessary conditions that are jointly sufficient to produce an effect—I think we must admit that we do not really know what causes economic growth. Sicily in the fifteenth century, Holland in the sixteenth century, Japan today; social scientists can pick a people, culture, or nation and tell a plausible story about some of the reasons for economic fail­ure or success, in that case. But that is a far cry from a general causal theory. Try listing all the potential causal conditions for wealth production men­tioned by David Landes (1998) in his monumental economic history of the world. Then ask yourself this question: Are any of those conditions sufficient to produce economic growth? The answer is no. Are any of those conditions even necessary?

Having guns did it here. Having Jews did it there. In this case it was immi­gration policy; in that case it was having access to quinine. In this case it was freeing the serfs; in that case it was the availability of fossil fuel. In this case it was the weather; in that case it was willingness to trade with outsiders. In this case it was having good colonial masters; in that case it was high con­sumer demand. In this case and that case it was luck. Singapore is not a lib­eral democracy, but it is rich. India is the world's most populous democracy, but it is poor. Sweden in the eighteenth century was a sparsely populated democracy, and it was poor too. People who are religiously orthodox and don't believe in &quot;gender equality&quot; (e.g., Hasidic Jews) can be rich. Fully secu­larized egalitarian societies (e.g., former communist countries in Eastern Eu­rope ) may fail to thrive from an economic point of view. In 1950, Japan had &quot;Confucian values&quot; (which at the time didn't look very &quot;Western&quot;) and was poorer than Brazil . In 1990 Japan had the same &quot;Confucian values,&quot; which all of a sudden seemed very &quot;Protestant-like,&quot; as Japan outstripped Brazil . If I were a cynic, I would say that our most able economic historians are really good at identifying some of the unnecessary conditions that might have been jointly sufficient to produce wealth in any particular special case. Less cyni­cally, I think it is fair to say that despite many impressive post hoc historical accounts of the case-specific conditions that have promoted growth, one is entitled to feel confused about the general causes of economic success, if by &quot;causation&quot; we mean what J. S. Mill meant when he defined the term. How then are we to grasp the big changes that are taking place in the &quot;world order&quot;? What is the relationship between &quot;globalization&quot; (the link­ing of the world's economies), &quot;westernization&quot; (the adoption of Western ideas, ideals, norms, institutions, and products), and economic growth? If you keep your ear to the ground these days, you can hear many prophecies or speculations about the shape of the &quot;new world order.&quot; I will conclude by mentioning three.

 

Prophecy i: The West Is Best and Will Become Global (or at Least It Should Try to Take Over the World)

The prediction here is that Western-like aspirations will be fired up or freed up by globalization and will be the cause and the concomitant of economic growth. Western-like aspirations include a desire for liberal democracy, the decentralization of power, free enterprise, private property, individual rights, gender equality, and so on, and perhaps even a taste for Western products. With regard to &quot;globalization,&quot; &quot;westernization,&quot; and &quot;economic growth,&quot; this prediction imagines causal effects in all directions. Basically, this is the Western &quot;enlightenment&quot; origin story universalized and projected into the future.

 

Prophecy 2: Others Will Have a &quot;Piece of the Rock&quot; and Hold On to Their Distinctive Culture Too

In the early 1970s, I had a Sudanese student who did his Ph.D. on attitudes toward modernization among African students, using a beliefs and values questionnaire. He discovered that the &quot;materialism&quot; factor in his question­naire was orthogonal to the &quot;individualism&quot; factor; one could value material wealth without giving up the collectivist values of the tribe. The Saudi Arabi­ans liked that message so much they hired him to teach in their universities. Perhaps that is why Samuel Huntington's thesis (1996) that the West is unique but not universal and that other civilizations do not need to become like us to benefit from the technologies of the modern world is so popular in the non-Western world. This prediction imagines globalization and economic growth without deep cultural penetration from the West. Cultures and civi­lizations are encouraged to remain diverse while everyone gets a piece of the pie. 7

 

Prophecy 3: A Liberal Ottoman-Style Empire with Two &quot;Castes&quot; (Cosmopolitan Liberals and Local Non-Liberals)

I associate the first prophecy with Francis Fukuyama (1992) and the second with Samuel Huntington (1996). Let me conclude with my own augury. Imagine a world order that is liberal in the classical sense. Its leaders assume a &quot;stance of neutrality&quot; with regard to substantive cultural issues. They don't condition aid and protection on changes in local gender ideals, forms of au­thority, kinship structures, or coming of age ceremonies. They don't try to tell the members of different cultural groups that they have to live together or love each other or share the same emotional reactions, aesthetic ideals, and religious beliefs. They don't try to tell them how to run their private lives or that they must have private lives. Imagine that in this world order various sanctioning mechanisms make it possible to enforce minimal rules of civility: exit visas are always available, and no aggression is permitted across territor­ial boundaries. Imagine that such a world system is set up to support decen­tralized control over cultural issues and hence to promote local cultural efflorescence. Such an emergent &quot;new world order&quot; might look like a post­modern Ottoman &quot;millet system&quot; on a global scale.

I imagine this system would be two tiered and operating at two levels, global and local. I imagine its personnel will belong to two &quot;castes.&quot; There will be the cosmopolitan liberals, who are trained to appreciate value neutrality and cultural diversity and who run the global institutions of the world system. And there will be the local non-liberals, who are dedicated to one form or another of thick ethnicity and are inclined to separate themselves from &quot;others,&quot; thereby guaranteeing that there is enough diversity remaining in the world for the cosmopolitan liberals to appreciate. The global elite (those who are cosmopolitan and liberal) will, of course, come from all nationalities. In the new universal cosmopolitan culture of the global tier of the world system, your ancestry and skin color will be far less important than your education, your values, and your travel plans. It is already the case in the postmodern cosmopolitan world that you don't have to grow up in the West to be Western any more than you have to grow up in the southern world to adopt an indigenous Third World point of view. Finally, I imagine that it would be possible in this &quot;new world order&quot; for individuals to switch tiers and castes in both directions, moving from global liberalism to local non-liberalism and back, within the course of a single life.

With regard to globalization, westernization, and economic growth, I would hazard this guess. If it should turn out as an empirical generalization that economic growth can be pulled off relying only on the shallow or thin aspects of Western society (e.g., weapons, information technology, Visa cards), then cultures won't converge, even as they get rich. If economic growth is contingent on accepting the deep or thick aspects of Western culture (e.g., individualism, ideals of femininity, egalitarianism, the Bill of Rights), then cultures will not converge and will not develop economically because their sense of identity will supersede their desire for material wealth.

Postscript

Among the many fascinating remarks heard at the conference were several &quot;indigenous&quot; tes­timonials from cosmopolitan intellectuals out of Africa and Latin America . These representa­tives from the &quot; Third World &quot; played the part of disgruntled &quot;insiders,&quot; bearing witness to the impoverishment of their own native cultures, telling us how bad things can be in the home coun­try. That role has become increasingly complex, even dubious, in our postmodern world, where the outside is in and the inside is all over the place (think of CNN, VISA, and the Big Mac). For most globe-hopping managers of the world system, including cosmopolitan intellectuals from out of the &quot; Third World ,&quot; travel plans now matter more than ancestry. Consequently, one feels inclined to raise doubts about any claims to authority based on an equation of citizenship (or national origin) with &quot;indigenous&quot; voice. After all, whose voice is more &quot;indigenous&quot;? The voice of a &quot;Western-educated&quot; M.B.A. or Ph.D. from Dakar or Delhi, who looks down on his or her own cultural traditions and looks up to the United States for intellectual and moral guidance and material aid? Or the voice of a &quot;Western&quot; scholar who does years of fieldwork in rural vil­lages in Africa or Asia and understands and sees value in the traditions of &quot;others&quot;?

COMMENTS OF MONTANER, ETOUNGA-MANGUELLE, AND GRONDONA, WITH FURTHER COMMENTS BY SHWEDER

Carlos Alberto Montaner

Richard Shweder's comment is typical of those who expect Third World reactions from Latin Americans. He simply doesn't understand that Latin America is an exten­sion of the West. I don't understand why Shweder thinks that we ought to resign our­selves to authoritarian governments and economic models that condemn half of our people to misery when the entire world—beginning with the Japanese—believes that it was admirable when Japan copied the production techniques and social organiza­tion of the West. Perhaps the Brazilian favelas, with their infinite, barbaric misery, seem picturesque to him. I cannot accept those subhuman conditions. I believe that they must be eradicated and that the people living in them must have a chance for a better, more human life. How do I know what Latin Americans want? It's very simple: by following migration trends. Surveys demonstrate that half or more of the populations of Mexic Colombia, and Guatemala, among others, would abandon their countries for the United States. Why? Because the United States offers them what they don't find in their own countries.

What Shweder says of &quot;these representatives from the 'Third World' play[ing] the parti of disgruntled 'insiders'&quot; could also be applied to the Americans who are con­cerned about improving subhuman conditions in the black and Puerto Rican ghettos. If he is to be consistently uncritical of the values and attitudes of a culture, then he should have no problem with the Sicilian omerta. As a “disgruntled insider” and “cosmopolitan intellectual” from Africa, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on Richard Shweder's note. I do so with some diffidence. After all, I am responding to a Western scholar who identifies himself as more &quot;in­digenous&quot; than I am because he &quot;has done years of fieldwork in rural villages in ... Asia and understands and sees value in the traditions of 'others.'&quot; I have to confess that I failed to receive the &quot;intellectual and moral guidance and material aid&quot; I expected at the Harvard symposium, so I am going to tell the truth: We Africans really enjoy living in shantytowns where there isn't enough food, health care, or education for our children. Furthermore, our corrupt chieftaincy political sys­tems are really marvelous and have permitted countries like Mobutu's Zaire to earn us international prestige and respect.

Moreover, surely it would be terribly boring if free, democratic elections were orga­nized all over Africa . Were that to happen, we would no longer be real Africans, and by losing our identity—and our authoritarianism, our bloody civil wars, our illiteracy, our forty-five-year life expectancy—we would be letting down not only ourselves but also those Western anthropologists who study us so sympathetically and understand that we can't be expected to behave like human beings who seek dignity on the eve of the third millennium. We are Africans, and our identity matters! So let us fight for it with the full support of those Western scholars who have the wisdom and courage to acknowledge that Africans belong to a different world.

Mariano Grondona

There is a methodological difference between Richard Shweder and Latin Americans like Carlos Alberto Montaner and myself. Shweder's goal, were he focused on Latin America, would be to understand it. We want to change it. Anthropologists need the societies they study to remain relatively static and predictable, like an entomologist studying bees or ants. Montaner and I, on the other hand, have an existential ap­proach to our region: It is &quot;our&quot; world—where we come from—which we love. Be-cause of our commitment to it, we want it to advance to new levels of human fulfill­ment, closer to those in the developed world.

One must ask who represents Latin America better, Shweder and other foreign so­cial scientists or Montaner and myself? We belong to our region. We feel it. The fact (hat millions of Latin Americans are &quot;voting with their feet&quot; as they migrate to the developed countries and that the overwhelming electoral majorities are supporting progressive governments throughout our region eloquently testifies that our views and concerns are widely shared. To be sure, we travel back and forth between Latin America and the developed countries. But these experiences do not alienate us from Latin America. Rather, they both in­crease our concern about conditions, particularly for poor people, in Latin America and focus us on what needs to be done to change those conditions. Like the vast majority of our countrymen, we want our nations to have the democratic stability, justice, opportu­nity for advancement, and prosperity that we find in the advanced countries.

Richard A. Shweder's Reply to Montaner, Etounga-Manguelle, and Grondona

As far as I can tell nothing in note 1 (or in my chapter) recommends authoritarian rule, a life of squalor, or death at an early age. In authoritarian power orders, those in power act in such a way that only their own interests are served, and no one can stop them from doing so. I think the world would be a far better place if there were no such orders of power. And nothing suggests that we must be uncritical or accepting of the received ideas, attitudes, and practices of any cultural tradition, including our own. As I state in my chapter, &quot;Pluralists do make critical judgments. Indeed, the 'stance of justification' is so central to my style of cultural analysis that I would define a 'genuine' culture, a culture deserving of appreciation, as a way of life that is defensi­ble in the face of criticism from abroad.&quot;

If one truly cares to achieve some appreciation of a cultural tradition, one must usually engage in some participant observation and in a process of sympathetic under­standing. One initially tries to bracket all ethnocentric reactions and discover what is good, true, beautiful, or efficient in the ideas, attitudes, and practices of &quot;others.&quot; There is no guarantee that appreciation will be achieved. There is no guarantee that every­thing that is, is okay or &quot;genuine.&quot; Ideas, attitudes, and practices that are demonstrably bad, false, ugly, or inefficient should be criticized and perhaps even changed. So much for red herrings and the bogeyman of radical relativism. My essay is in fact a critique of both radical relativism (&quot;whatever is, is okay&quot;) and ethnocentric monism (&quot;there is only one way to lead a morally decent, rational and fulfilling life, and it's our way&quot;), al­though by my lights I did not see many radical relativists at the conference.

In a moment I will respond to one or two other points raised by Carlos Alberto Montaner, Daniel Etounga-Manguelle, and Mariano Grondona. First, however, I want to focus on what was actually said in note 1, namely, that in the postmodern world, one should be skeptical of all claims to authority based on the equation of citizenship (or national origin) with &quot;indigenous&quot; voice. And I want to tell you a story, which illustrates that point. Rabindranath Tagore is modern India 's most acclaimed poet. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, a spokesman for the India nationalist move­ment, and an admirer, interpreter, and literary beneficiary of the classical Sanskrit lit­eratures of India. In 1877, Tagore visited England for the first time. He was sixteen years old. He went there to study law. In his book India and Europe: An Essay in Un­derstanding, Wilhelm Halbfass quotes Tagore's impressions:

I had thought that the island of England was so small and the inhabitants so dedicated to learning that, before I arrived there, I expected the country from one end to the other would echo and re-echo with the lyrical essays of Tennyson; and I also thought that wher­ever I might be in this narrow island, I would hear constantly Gladstone's oratory, the ex­planation of the Vedas by Max Mueller, the scientific truth of Tindall, the profound thoughts of Carlyle and the philosophy of Bain. I was under the impression that wherever I would go I would find the old and the young drunk with the pleasure of &quot;intellectual&quot; enjoyment. But I have been very disappointed in this.

Apparently, the young Tagore, a political and civic &quot;outsider&quot; to the British Isles , was culturally more English and spoke the English language far better than most English­men. His reference to Max Mueller is highly pertinent to note 1 because it was Max Mueller, a German philologist and &quot;orientalist&quot; who taught at Oxford , to whom Hindu Brahmans turned to learn about Sanskrit and their own classical literary traditions.

This situation of &quot;outsiders&quot; and &quot;insiders&quot; trading places and keeping each other's valuable cultural heritages in play is not unusual, especially in the contempo­rary world. We live in a world where Afro-Caribbean scholars translate ancient Greek texts, where scholars from Africa, Asia, and Europe write perceptive books about the United States, and where the Max Mueller effect is alive and well. For example, Gusii intellectuals from Kenya, some of whom are quite expert in Western philosophy and science, read Robert LeVine's work (conducted from the 1950s through 1990s) to learn about the meaning, value, and history of Gusii norms and folkways. The main point of this observation is a simple one: Statements about the pros and cons of a cul-^l tural tradition do not gain authority and should not be granted authority on the basis I of claims to ancestry, membership, or national origin.

Note 1 was an aside, a parenthetical remark about my fascination with one as­pect of the structural organization of the conference. The conference was choreo­graphed in such a way that there was one session in which all the speakers from the &quot;Third World&quot; participated, and they spoke pretty much with one voice, support­ing the idea that &quot;Western civilization&quot; is superior to all the rest. Now, of course, this idea is not unpopular in many capitals of Asia , Africa , and Latin America . It is especially popular among those Western, westernized, or westernizing elites who tend to view the received beliefs, attitudes, and everyday practices of non-Western peoples, even their own countrymen, as unenlightened, superstitious, magical, au­thoritarian, corrupt, or otherwise unworthy or embarrassing. But that type of wholesale acceptance of &quot;Western modernity&quot; over non-Western &quot;traditionalisms&quot; of various kinds has never been the only voice in town in either the &quot;West&quot; or the &quot;East,&quot; the &quot;North&quot; or the &quot;South,&quot; the &quot;developed&quot; or the &quot;underdeveloped&quot;world. Had there been other types of voices in the session, the voice of &quot; Third World &quot; intellectuals who might speak with pride and admiration about &quot;indige­nous&quot; ideas, attitudes, and practices, the session would perhaps have been less fas­cinating. Perhaps I would not have been led to wonder about the use of &quot;insider&quot; testimonials from the &quot; Third World &quot; to lend authority to the idea that the Protes­tant &quot; First World &quot; really got it right.

Carlos Alberto Montaner and Mariano Grondona are impressed by migration pat­terns, by the fact that &quot;millions of Latin Americans are 'voting with their feet'&quot; in fa­vor of the &quot;developed&quot; world. The first time I ever heard the &quot;voting with your feet&quot; argument was in the 1960s, when a famous conservative made the argument that black migration patterns into South Africa far exceeded black migration patterns out of South Africa. He interpreted this as evidence that black Africans were voting with their feet in favor of the apartheid government of South Africa over other African states! I suspect they were not voting or expressing their moral and cultural prefer­ences at all—just going where there were higher-paying jobs.

Daniel Etounga-Manguelle seems to imply that one cannot live a dignified life and a life that is distinctively African at the same time. As I stated in my essay, I am not a fan of broad categories such as &quot;Latin American&quot; or &quot;African&quot; as ways of identifying cultural communities—Bahia is not San Paolo, the Yoruba are not the Masai. Never­theless, I do believe, as did Edward Sapir, that &quot;the societies in which different soci­eties live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.&quot; For a pluralist, &quot;distinctness&quot; or &quot;difference&quot; is not a term of disparage­ment. With complete respect for all three of my critics, whose sincerity I never doubted, whose company and conversation I much enjoyed, and whose testimonials and arguments I found fascinating, I fully confess to rejecting the idea that the only or very best way to be dignified, decent, rational, and fully human is to live the life of a North American or a northern European.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Information Drawn from Social Psychology (7 th edition) by David G. Myers'''

''“We can barely be distinguished from our social situations, for they form us and decide our possibilities”'' – Sartre

Social psychology studies how situations affect our behavior and the way in which we perceive ourselves/others. Our interaction patterns in specific situations orient us to each other, our culture, and ideas about “human nature&quot;. Social psychology is different than sociology in that it orients mostly to small group interaction. Also, it tends to use laboratory experimental methods, while sociology uses more naturalistic observation, surveys/interviews, and statistical manipulation of large data sets. They want to use “average people” to get deterministic theories.

'''Constructing the Self in a Social World:'''

Socially shared beliefs (ideologies) help us make sense of the world, but hinder the search for better explanations

Hindsight bias – tendency to exaggerate the degree to which after learning an outcome that “I knew it all along”

Self-reference effect – information relevant to our conception of who we are (self schemas) is remembered well

Spotlight effect – tendency for people to irrationally think that others will notice their every action and feeling

Looking-glass self – we use what we believe others think of us to build perceptions of ourselves in comparison

Miswants, exaggeration, and dual attitudes – people overestimate the happiness relationships and acquisitions will bring them, underestimate their psychological immune system's capacity to rationalize, discount/forgive emotional trauma, and our automatic implicit attitudes about a person or thing differ from our reasoned attitudes

Self-Serving Bias – tendency to credit success to individual qualities, but failure to uncontrollable externalities

Unrealistic Optimism - tendency to think we are better than the average person and mostly immune to misfortune

False Consensus – tendency to overestimate the number of people who agree with us on matters of fact/opinion

False Uniqueness – tendency to serve self image by believing our talents and moral judgments uniquely superior

Self-Esteem Maintenance – facing failure, we tend to perceive others as failing and put down vulnerable others

Self-Handicapping – the tendency to protect self-image with behaviors that create useful excuses for later failure

'''Social Beliefs and Judgments:'''

The Fundamental Attribution Bias – tendency to underestimate situational influences and overestimate individual character/disposition/abilities when explaining the behavior of a person or a group of people in a social context.

Confirmation Bias - We are likely to use mixed evidence on any topic to reinforce our existing beliefs on the nature of a phenomena. The remedy for this bias is to actively try to explain why the contrary may be true. Reconstructing beliefs and memories - We reconstruct the past by combining fragments of memory with our current information, feelings, and expectations. Memory is often revised to justify fundamental change in beliefs that might seem hypocritical… attitudes seem consistent and mildly pleasant events are more rosy in photos

Misinformation Effect – we recall details and associations from memory inaccurately, but with great confidence

Heuristic – a rule of thumb mental strategy that allows us to make quick/efficient judgments (not so accurate) Availability Heuristic - tendency to judge the validity or likelihood of an argument based on instances of evidence that come most readily to mind.

Representativeness Heuristic – tendency to presume, against the odds, that someone or something belongs to a specific group because they somehow resemble a typical member

Illusory Correlation – tendency to perceive relationships between events or conditions where none actually exists

Illusion of Control – the idea that chance events are subject to our influence, and positive outcomes are evidence

Behavioral Confirmation – a type of self-fulfilling prophesy whereby people's social expectations lead them to act in ways that causes others to confirm such expectations

'''The Relationship Between Attitudes and Behaviors:'''

The evidence doesn't support the idea that changing attitude will change behavior, in fact, the contrary pattern is much more common… under which conditions might attitude be able to influence behavior? (policy importance)

1. Minimize other influences on supposed attitude convictions and on related behavior 2. Make the attitude specifically relevant to the action you are hoping to produce 3. Make the attitude as potent as possible

Cognitive Dissonance – tension arising when someone is has inconsistency between beliefs and/or actions

Insufficient Justification Effect – reducing dissonance by internally justifying behavior when external justification is insufficient

Overjustification effect – if you pay someone to do something they already like, they may begin to attribute that behavior to the money instead of intrinsic internal motivations

'''Other Assorted Social Psych Concepts:'''

Outgroup Homogeneity Effect – perception that people in groups different than one's own are very similar

Just World Phenomena – people tend to believe that the world is just and people thus get what they deserve

Displacement - redirection of aggression to a target other than the source of the frustration; a safe, acceptable one

Proximity and Interaction Effect – just proximity and positive behavior towards individuals results in fondness

Bystander Effect -- likelihood that someone will provide help to another is reduced when more people are around

Adaptation Level Phenomena – the tendency to adapt to a given level of stimulation, then only react to that level

Depressive Realism – tendency of mildly depressed people to make more accurate (less self serving) attributions

Sleeper Effect – delayed impact of a message; effective later after we forget initial reasons for discounting it

Mere Exposure Effect – novel stimuli liked more after one is repeatedly exposed to them; regardless of quality

Moral Inclusion/Exclusion ­ - perception of certain people as inside/outside our bounds of moral or ethical concern

This page is about cracking (recovering) passwords on Windows XP machines, which is a computationally difficult process. If you just need to set a new password (but without need to recover the old one), then this guide is not for you. For that, you can use, for example, the free-software tool [http://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/ Offline NT Password &amp; Registry Editor] or other similar programs.

{{wikipedia|Password cracking}}

== Background ==

The Windows XP passwords are [[w:Cryptographic hash function |hashed]] using [[w:LM hash|LM hash]] and/or [[w:NTLM|NTLM hash]]. The hashes are stored in c:\windows\system32\config\SAM. The SAM file is encrypted using c:\windows\system32\config\system and is locked when Windows is running. This file is a registry hive which is loaded under HKLM\SECURITY\SAM when windows is running. The SYSTEM account is the only account which can read this part of the registry. To get the passwords, you need to shutdown Windows, [[w:decrypt|decrypt]] the SAM file, and then crack the hashes. You can also obtain the hashes using other software that does not require you to turn your computer off. If everything goes well, you'll have the passwords in 15 minutes.

The [http://www.liddicott.com/~sam?p=97 SKCLONE] tool will allow extracting password hashes in PWDUMP format from the live SAM and importing them to other live systems including 64 bit systems, making it a useful tool for migrating local user accounts to 64 bit windows. It does however require you to run the software as the SYSTEM account, since it will try to reach HKLM\SECURITY\SAM in the registry.

==Three ways to recover Windows Password==

Usually, we can recover Windows admin password in two traditional ways. The first is to change Screen password with another admin account; the second is to recover the previous password with the windows password reset disk that had been created before you forgot the password. Take Windows XP for example, 

*At the Windows XP login prompt when the password is entered incorrectly click the reset button in the login failed window. 

*Insert the password reset diskette into the computer and click Next. 

*If the correct diskette Windows XP will open a window prompting for the new password you wish to use.

However, we often ignore the importance of security until we have been locked out of computer. Fortunately, there is still the last way that can unlock your computer without reinstalling - erase Windows password with Windows password reset CD, which can recover admin password for Windows 7/XP/Vista/NT/2000/2003.... Take Windows Password unlocker for example, followings are the steps to create the reset CD

*Download Windows Password Unlocker from Password Unlocker Official site 

*Decompress the Windows password unlocker and note that there is an .ISO image file. Burn the image file onto an blank CD with the burner freely supported by Password Unlocker. 

*Insert the newly created CD into the locked computer and re-boot it from the CD drive. 

*After launched the CD, a window pop up with all your account names(if you have several accounts) select one of the accounts that you have forgotten its password to reset it.

==Detailed Instructions for LoginRecovery.com Service==
*Go to http://loginrecovery.com/ and from the home page click the option to download either the floppy disk image or CD image.  If you use the floppy disk image, insert a blank floppy disk into your computer, run the program and a bootable floppy will be created.  If you use the CD version, you will need to manually burn the ISO image to a CD, using software which specifically burns ISO images

*Insert the floppy disk or CD into the target computer from which you wish to extract the passwords.  Then boot the computer.  You may need to alter the BIOS settings to ensure the floppy drive or CD is booted from.

*If you used the floppy drive some messages will briefly appear on the screen and then the computer will shutdown.  On the floppy disk will be a newly created file called &quot;upload.txt&quot; which will contain the encrypted passwords.  If you used the CD version, the encrypted passwords will be shown on the screen; write them down into a text file.

*If you wish to wait up to 48 hours or pay to get your passwords, then you can upload the file onto the LoginRecovery site. Otherwise, continue reading.

*The file will consist of several 2-line entries, one for each account. Copy the 2 lines for the account you want and paste it into [http://utilitymill.com/utility/LoginRecovery_Decode this utility] to decode it into the &quot;pwdump&quot; format.

*Use any of the tools in the following section to decode the pwdump hash.

== Top-Password.com ==
How to '''Recover Lost Microsoft Windows XP Administrator Password'''
**&lt;u&gt;Use another accounts with administrator rights&lt;/u&gt;
If there is still another user account which you remember has administrative privileges, you can opt it for Windows XP password recovery.
Restart system and boot the system into Safe Mode. Click on the icon
for the administrators account at the Account Log on Screen. Once system has booted to the desktop, you reset password with following steps.
*A. Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Computer Management.
*B. Double click Local Users and Groups -&gt; folder Users.
*C. Right click the account user name which password was lost, then click Set Password.
*D. Reset password - keep New Password and Confirm Password blank.
*E. After finished, restart PC and login.

**&lt;u&gt;Burn a CD/DVD to recover lost Windows XP password&lt;/u&gt;
With professional password recovery software, you just need burn an ISO image file to the CD/DVD on an accessible PC.

=== Ophcrack demo ===
The easiest site to use is the online demo for the Ophcrack software tool.

*Use PWDump or other password extraction tool to extract the passwords from the target computer. (Note: In order to work, it must be run under an Administrator account )

*Retain only the part with the two hashes and the colon in between:
 CC5E9ACBAD1B25C9AAD3B435B51404EE:996E6760CDDD8815A2C24A110CF040FB
*Copy the 65 character result from the last step, goto http://www.objectif-securite.ch/en/ophcrack.php, scroll down, and paste it into the box labeled &quot;hash:&quot;. Press the submit hash button. '''Wait patiently'''
*The password is
 mullet

If your password is not alphanumeric (indicated by 7 dots in part of the password, or if it says &quot;Not found&quot;), then you will have to use one of the following more powerful sites that contain rainbow tables for symbols as well:

=== Plain-Text.info ===
*Use PWDump or other password extraction tool to extract the passwords from the target computer. (Note: In order to work, it must be run under an Administrator account )

*Edit the password hash to the pwdump format (add the colon-delimited username and ID number fields in the front, and 3 colons at the end):
 Administrator:500:CC5E9ACBAD1B25C9AAD3B435B51404EE:996E6760CDDD8815A2C24A110CF040FB:::

*Go to http://plain-text.info/, click &quot;Add Hashes&quot;, enter the hashes in the box, select &quot;lm&quot; as the algorithm, complete the CAPTCHA, and click submit
*They only crack 2 hashes every 15 minutes, so you may have to wait

*After a few minutes/hours, come back, go to &quot;Search&quot;, type in your hash (just the LM part), and see if it is cracked

*Read their FAQ for more info.

=== OnlineHashCrack.com ===
*Use PWDump or other password extraction tool to extract the passwords from the target computer.

*Go to http://www.OnlineHashCrack.com and enter the LM or NTLM hash (part before the colon) into the query field and click the &quot;Search&quot; button.
*Check the status page occasionally to see if they have been cracked.
*If the hash is not in their database, the rainbow tables will be used to find it.

== Notes ==
*If the information retrieved from the pwdump consists of an empty first part, then the LM hash is not stored.  This means that the password is blank, in which case it would look like this:
 Administrator:500:0:
 _31,D6,CF,E0,D1,6A,E9,31,B7,3C,59,D7,E0,C0,89,C0,xxxxx:::
If it says anything different, then they implemented better security and force you to crack the NTLM hash, which is much more difficult and out of the scope of this guide.
*This only works if the password is 14 characters or shorter
*If the password in Windows 2000/XP/2003 is longer than 14 characters, it will be shortened to two hashes of length seven characters each
*An alternative, which uses the same method of comparing known hashes against unknown is called [[w:RainbowCrack|RainbowCrack]], available at http://www.antsight.com/zsl/rainbowcrack/ although this program uses [[w:rainbow table|Rainbow Table]]s that can be in excess of 64 Gb; these tables can be obtained at http://rainbowtables.shmoo.com/
*A comprehensive project of comparing known hashes against an unknown is at http://www.rainbowcrack.com/ however it requires that you submit a Rainbow Table before you can gain access to their server

= Defense against attack =
*Have a password longer than 14 characters.
*http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299656/ - prevent Windows from storing LM hashes

= Mac OS X 10.3 =

Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) also stores shadowed LM+NTLM hashes for each user.  They can be cracked in the same way as the hashes for Windows above

*First find the &quot;generateduid&quot; for the user you want with the command 
 $ '''niutil -readprop . /users/&lt;username&gt; generateduid'''
 70902C33-AC79-11DA-AFDF-000A95CD9AF8

*The hashes are stored in the file &lt;tt&gt;/var/db/shadow/hash/&lt;generateduid&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  The file is 104 characters long, consisting of the 64-character NTLM+LM hashes and the 40-character SHA1 hash.  To retrieve the NTLM+LM hashes, you can run this command as an administrator for example
 $ '''sudo cut -c1-64 /var/db/shadow/hash/70902C33-AC79-11DA-AFDF-000A95CD9AF8'''
 996E6760CDDD8815A2C24A110CF040FBCC5E9ACBAD1B25C9AAD3B435B51404EE

*The hashes are stored in the reverse order as the pwdump format (NTLM first instead of LM first), so you need to switch the 32-character halves and insert a colon between them
 CC5E9ACBAD1B25C9AAD3B435B51404EE:996E6760CDDD8815A2C24A110CF040FB

*Then follow the instructions for Windows passwords

= Mac OS X 10.4 =

Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) improves the security by only storing LM+NTLM hashes for users who enable Windows Sharing for their account; and when they do enable it, it asks them to enter their password with a warning that their password is stored in a less secure format.  However, for those users with Windows Sharing enabled, the above method will still work.  The shadow file format is a little different, but the LM+NTLM hashes are still the first 64 characters.  If the hashes are not stored, you will get all 0's when you try to retrieve the hashes.

= Samba passwords =

In older versions of Samba, the password hashes for Samba users were stored in the file /etc/smbpasswd (location may vary, only root has access) and are in similar format to Windows password hashes discussed above.  In newer versions of Samba, run the following as root to get the same information:

== Differentiate from first principle(otherwise known as differentialisation) ==
This section and the *differentiation technique* section can be skipped if you are already familiar with calculus/differentiation.

In calculus, differentiation is a very important operation applied to functions of real numbers. To differentiate a function f(x), we simply evaluate the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}&lt;/math&gt; means that we let ''h'' approach 0. However, for now, we can simply think of it as putting ''h'' to 0, i.e., letting ''h'' = 0 at an appropriate time. There are various notations for the result of  differentiation (called the derivative), for example
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx}= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
mean the same thing. We say, f'(x) is the derivative of f(x). Differentiation is useful for many purposes, but we shall not discuss why calculus was invented, but rather how we can apply calculus to the study of generating functions.

It should be clear that if
&lt;math&gt;g(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
then
&lt;math&gt;g^\prime(x) = f^\prime(x)&lt;/math&gt;
the above law is important. If g(x) a closed-form of f(x), then it is valid to differentiate both sides to obtain a new generating function.

Also if
&lt;math&gt;h(x) = g(x) + f(x)
then
:&lt;math&gt;h^\prime(x) = g^\prime(x) + f^\prime(x)&lt;/math&gt;
This can be verified by looking at the properties of limits.

==== Example 1 ====
Differentiate from first principle f(x) where
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Firstly, we form the ''difference quotient''
:&lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
We can't set ''h'' to 0 to evaluate the limit at this point. Can you see why? We need to expand the quadratic first.
:&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2xh + h^2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
We can now factor out the ''h'' to obtain now
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}2x + h &lt;/math&gt;
from where we can let ''h'' go to zero safely to obtain the derivative, 2''x''. So
:&lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x) = 2x&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently:
:&lt;math&gt;(x^2)' = 2x&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 2 ====
Differentiate from first principles, p(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.

We start from the difference quotient:
:&lt;math&gt;p'(x)= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x + h)^n - x^n}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
By the binomial theorem, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}(x^n + nx^{n-1}h + ...+ h^n - x^n)&lt;/math&gt;
The first ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; cancels with the last, to get
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}(nx^{n-1}h + ...+ h^n)&lt;/math&gt;
Now, we bring the constant 1/''h'' inside the brackets
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{h\to 0}nx^{n-1} +...+ h^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and the result falls out:
:&lt;math&gt;=nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Important Result'''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
If
:&lt;math&gt;
p(x) = x^n
&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;
p'(x) = nx^{n-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As you can see, differentiate from first principle involves working out the derivative of a function through algebraic manipulation, and for that reason this section is algebraically very difficult.

==== Example 3 ====
Assume that if 
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(x) + g(x)&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;h^\prime(x) = f^\prime(x) + g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiate &lt;math&gt; x^2 + x^5 &lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
Let &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x^2 + x^5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h'(x) = 2x + 5x^4&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 4 ====
Show that if
:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = Af(x) then&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^\prime(x) = Af^\prime(x)&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
g(x) &amp;=&amp; Af(x)\\
\\
g'(x) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{A}{h}(f(x + h) - f(x))\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; A\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}(f(x + h) - f(x))\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; Af'(x)
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 5 ====
Differentiate from first principle
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f'(x) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}(\frac{1}{1-(x+h)}  - \frac{1}{1-x})\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}(\frac{1 - x - (1 - (x+h))}{(1-(x+h))(1-x)})\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}(\frac{h}{(1-(x+h))(1-x)})\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{(1-(x+h))(1-x)}\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Exercises ====
1. Differentiate
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^2&lt;/math&gt;

2. Differentiate
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = (1 - z)^2&lt;/math&gt;

3. Differentiate from first principle
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1} {(1 - z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. Differentiate
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = (1 - z)^3&lt;/math&gt;

5. Prove the result assumed in example 3 above, i.e. if
:''f''(''x'')=''g''(''x'')+''h''(''x'')
then
:''f''&amp;prime;(''x'')=''g''&amp;prime;(''x'')+''h''&amp;prime;(''x'').

''Hint: use limits''.

=== Differentiating f(z) = (1 - z)^n ===
We aim to derive a vital result in this section, namely, to derive the derivative of
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = (1 - z)^n &lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' &amp;ge; 1 and ''n'' an integer. We will show a number of ways to arrive at the result.

==== Derivation 1 ====
Let's proceed:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = (1 - z)^n&lt;/math&gt;
expand the right hand side using binomial expansion
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) 
= 1 - {n \choose 1}z + {n \choose 2}z^2 + ... + (-1)^nz^n&lt;/math&gt; 
differentiate both sides
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) 
= - {n \choose 1} + {n \choose 2}2z + ... + (-1)^nnz^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
now we use &lt;math&gt;{n\choose i} = \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) 
= - \frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} + \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}2z + ... + (-1)^nnz^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and there are some cancelling
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) 
= - \frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} + \frac{n!}{1!(n-2)!}z + ... + (-1)^nnz^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
take out a common factor of -n, and recall that 1! = 0! = 1 we get
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) 
=-n(1 + \frac{n-1!}{1!(n-2)!}z + ... + (-1)^{n-1}z^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
let j = i - 1, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) 
=-n(1 + \frac{n-1!}{1!(n-2)!}z + ... + (-1)^{n-1}z^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt;
but this is just the expansion of (1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = -n(1 - z)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Derivation 2 ====
Similar to Derivation 1, we use instead the definition of a derivative:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{(1 - (z+h))^n - (1-z)^n}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
expand using the binomial theorem
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}(-1)^i(z+h)^i - \sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}(-1)^iz^i}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
factorise
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}(-1)^i((z+h)^i - z^i)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
take the limit inside (recall that [Af(x)]' = Af'(x) )
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}(-1)^i\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{(z+h)^i - z^i}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
the inside is just the derivative of z&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n{n \choose i}(-1)^iiz^{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;
exactly as derivation 1, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f'(z) = -n(1-z)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

''' Example '''
Differentiate (1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

''' Solution 1'''
:f(z) = (1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 - 2z + z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:f'(z) = - 2 + 2z
:f'(z) = - 2(1 - z)

''' Solution 2'''
By the result derived above we have
:f'(z) = -2(1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;2 - 1&lt;/sup&gt; = -2(1 - z)

==== Exercises ====
Imitate the method used above or otherwise, differentiate:

1. (1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

2. (1 + z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

3. (1 + z)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

4. (Harder) 1/(1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (Hint: Use definition of derivative)

=== Differentiation technique ===
We will teach how to differentiate functions of this form:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1} {g(z)}&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. functions whose reciprocals are also functions. We proceed, by the definition of differentiation:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1} {g(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
f'(z) &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h} (\frac{1} {g(z+h)}   - \frac{1} {g(z)})\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h} (\frac{g(z) - g(z+h)} {g(z+h)g(z)}) \\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(z+h) - g(z)}{h} \frac{-1} {g(z+h)g(z)} \\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; \lim_{h\to 0} g'(z) \frac{-1} {g(z+h)g(z)}\\
\\
      &amp;=&amp; -\frac{g'(z)} {g(z)^2}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example 1====
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{1-z}  &amp; = &amp; 1 +&amp; z + z^2 + z^3 + ... \\
\\
(\frac{1}{1-z})' &amp; = &amp;    &amp; 1 + 2z  + 3z^2 + ... \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
by
:&lt;math&gt; (\frac{1}{g})' = \frac{-g'}{g^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is a function of ''z'', we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{(1-z)^2} &amp; = &amp;    &amp; 1 + 2z  + 3z^2 + ... \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which confirmed the result derived using a counting argument.



==== Exercises ====
Differentiate

1. 1/(1-z)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

2. 1/(1-z)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

3. 1/(1+z)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

4. Show that (1/(1 - z)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)' = n/(1-z)&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Differentiation applied to generating functions ===
Now that we are familiar with differentiation from first principle, we should consider:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1} {1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
we know
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {1 - x^2} = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + ....&lt;/math&gt;
differentiate both sides
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1} {1 - x^2}\end{pmatrix}' = 2x + 4x^3 + 6x^5 + ....&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2x} {(1 - x^2)^2} = 2x(1 + 2x^2 + 3x^4 + ....)&lt;/math&gt;
therefore we can conclude that 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {(1 - x^2)^2} = 1 + 2x^2 + 3x^4 + ....&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we can obtain the above result by the substituion method as well,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {(1 - z)^2} = 1 + 2z + 3z^2 + ....&lt;/math&gt;
letting z = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; gives you the require result.

The above example demonstrated that we need not concern ourselves with difficult differentiations. Rather, to get the results the easy way, we need only to differentiate the basic forms and apply the substitution method. By basic forms we mean generating functions of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1-z)^n}&lt;/math&gt;
for n &amp;ge; 1.

Let's consider the number of solutions to
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_n = m&lt;/math&gt;
for a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 0 for i = 1, 2, ... n.

We know that for any ''m'', the number of solutions is the coefficient to:
:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x + x^2 + ...)^n = \frac{1}{(1 - z)^n}&lt;/math&gt;
as discussed before.

We start from:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - z} = 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^n + ...&lt;/math&gt;
differentiate both sides (note that 1 = 1!)
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1!}{(1 - z)^2} = 1 + 2x + 3x^2... + nx^{n-1} + ...&lt;/math&gt;
differentiate again
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2!}{(1 - z)^3} = 2 + 2\times 3x... + n(n-1)x^{n-2} + ...&lt;/math&gt;
and so on for (n-1) times
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(n-1)!}{(1 - z)^n} = (n - 1)! +  \frac{n!}{1!}x + \frac{(n + 1)!}{2!}x^2 + \frac{(n + 2)!}{3!}x^3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
divide both sides by (n-1)!
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - z)^n} = 1 +  \frac{n!}{(n-1)!1!}x + \frac{(n + 1)!}{(n-1)!2!}x^2 + \frac{(n + 2)!}{(n-1)!3!}x^3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
the above confirms the result derived using a counting argument.</text>

Does this soup have a particular lineage?
Is it a traditional soup of a particular cuisine?
When I think ''potato soup'', I certainly don't think about carrots, flour and boullion; all of which seem to cover up the &quot;potato-ness&quot; of the soup.

==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Purpose of the Book'''&lt;/font&gt;==

[[File:The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg|thumb|left|480x480px|Earth as seen by Apollo 17.]]

As this photo of the Earth from a distance shows, our planet is located in space.  So space is not a different place to go to: we are already there.  We think of it as different because most of us spend most of our lives on about 1/8th of the solid-gas interface of one planet among the billions in the Galaxy.  It is where we evolved, and where conditions are reasonably habitable for us, so we think of it as normal.  In reality, our comfortable planet is the exception, and normal is unusable environments hostile to life as we know it.  We can change that by technical means, and are starting to do so first by placing devices in space, then by creating habitable environments.

As of 2014 global space industry had already reached US$ 323 billion/year of economic activity.  This is expected to greatly increase in the future as our civilization learns to use this environment and expand into it.  For these and other reasons space systems engineering is a worthy field of study within the larger context of all sciences and engineering.  Historically the main engineering challenges were transportation that could reach space at all, and the design of relatively small satellites with finite lives as cargo for such transportation.  These topics are adequately covered by existing textbooks such as Sutton's '''[http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Propulsion-Elements-George-Sutton/dp/0470080248/ Rocket Propulsion Elements]''' and Griffen and French's '''[http://www.amazon.com/Vehicle-Design-Second-Edition-Education/dp/1563475391 Space Vehicle Design]'''.

Starting with more recent projects, like the International Space Station (ISS), new design characteristics have become more important.  These include permanent habitation, evolution and growth, sustainability, and industrial capacity.  Future projects will require new types of propulsion, life support, production, and assembly.  Single projects can no longer be considered in isolation, either.  For example, the ISS depends on multiple launch vehicles to deliver crew, supplies, and hardware for expansion.  This book is intended as an introduction to both the historical design challenges of transport and space hardware design, and the new engineering methods needed for future projects.  The online format is also intended to address some of the limitations of traditional printed textbooks:

*  Their high cost in recent years, which is addressed by making this an open-source Wikibook,
*  The inability to include other media types, such as audio, video, simulations, and software.
*  The relative difficulty of updating printed books in a fast moving field.
*  The very large amount of information in this field, which is addressed by links and a supplementary library.
*  The lack of practice projects.  Learning well involves more than just reading, it should include hands-on work.  The latter part of the book includes real projects which interested readers or teams can work on.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Links to Additional Material'''&lt;/font&gt;==

We cannot fit the entirety of a field of engineering into a book-length introduction such as this one.  Therefore we will include extensive hypertext (World Wide Web) links to more detailed sources, such as the Wikipedia online encyclopedia.  A '''[http://www.mediafire.com/?y1ko8gj5rouob Rocket Science Library]''' is being set up to house some of the more useful publicly available articles and books to supplement the book.  We cannot include copyrighted works without permission, but we can list useful ones and where to find them in both the '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/References|References]]''' section of this book, and in notes in the Library folders.  We are aware that popular culture incorrectly calls Space Systems Engineering &quot;Rocket Science&quot;, as it is part of engineering rather than science and not exclusively about rockets.  We will cheerfully adopt the popular label for our Library and hope that serious students understand the difference.

Engineers use other tools besides books to do their work, such as simulation software and spreadsheets.  Wikibooks does not support including software files, so links to where these items can be found are intended to be added over time.  A draft paper summarizing a real proposed program can be found at: '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Danielravennest/papers/Mars21 To Mars and Beyond]'''.  This program will be used for examples within the book, and can be used by readers for practice in design.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Book Organization'''&lt;/font&gt;==

The book is organized as a progression from science and engineering fundamentals, to subsystems, complete projects, and then combined systems which have linked projects.  We will try to emphasize underlying principles and key design parameters, as those have more lasting value than, for example, the particulars of a current launch vehicle.  We include many methods and concepts which are not in current use for several reasons.  First, when starting a new project, it is a good idea to at least briefly consider '''all''' the possible alternatives, before narrowing down to the most relevant ones.  Second, this is a future-oriented book.  While a concept may not be useful today, knowing what the state of the art is and what technology areas to watch helps to tell when a concept will become useful.  Third, having all the ideas in front of you might spur a new combination or application that had not been thought of before.  This has actually happened to one of the authors (Eder) on more than one occasion, so I can attest to its usefulness.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;Part 1: Science and Engineering Fundamentals&lt;/span&gt;=== 
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

All of engineering depends on underlying knowledge from mathematics and the sciences.  We therefore start with some prerequisites which the reader should be familiar with, and the more important principles, formulas, and methods which apply to space systems.  The largest part of this is physics, including the motive forces and energy sources for space projects, but also some key ideas of the other sciences, including Astronomy, Planetary Science, and Chemistry.  Following that we introduce general engineering methods, including the discipline of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering '''Systems Engineering''']. The goal of systems engineering is to optimize a complex system over its life cycle.  Most space projects are complex enough that this discipline is very useful.  Complexity demands methods of tracking the details to keep the project as a whole a coherent effort.  We introduce the tools that engineers use in their work, followed by the variety of specialty engineering disciplines such as structural and electrical design which are used in parallel with the overall system optimization.  Most projects require specialists in different areas, because there is too wide an area of knowledge for one person to cover all of it.

In early concept development one person might do all of the work on a project.  As the design progresses, the amount of detail and knowledge required makes it more efficient to use teams of specialists.  This in turn demands efficient coordination within a project team.  The general topic of project economics addresses project organization and management, funding, and financial analysis.  The last two sections of Part 1 consider existing projects and the areas for future projects.  One needs to compare proposed future projects to already existing ones, to see if they give enough improvement to justify their creation.  The range of possibilities for future projects helps identify goals, requirements, and growth paths.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;Part 2: Transport methods&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

The next part of the book considers transportation. Before you can do anything else at a given space location, you first have to get there.  Historically the transportation component has been much more massive than the cargo.  Solving transportation challenges became the primary focus of space projects.  Although still important, we take a more balanced approach in this book.  Improved transportation methods and use of local resources will shift the mass ratio towards the destination, so we give that part of space projects equal attention.

Many more transport methods have been proposed (about 75) than have actually been used to date (about 5), and one of them, '''[[Space Transport and Engineering Methods/Combustion Engines#B. Internally Fueled Engines (Rockets)|chemical rockets]]''', has been used by far the most.  Part 2 lists the many known and speculative space propulsion methods by category. After listing the available concepts, the later sections will make some comparisons, and discuss how to select the best candidates for a given project. 

Part of the reason chemical rockets have been used so much is &quot;first mover advantage&quot;.  They were the first type of space propulsion to get extensive development.  They have the longest history, most optimization of design, and most familiarity, so they continue to be used.  That does not mean they are objectively the best solution for all time, and all circumstances.  Use of alternative methods, such as ion engines, is becoming more common in recent years.  When starting a new project, a survey of all possible technical choices is worth doing, before narrowing the list down to the best candidates, so that no good option is overlooked.  That is one reason the list in this book attempts to be comprehensive.  Additionally, no single method is optimal for all locations and mission requirements.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;Part 3: Engineering Methods&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

Part 3 considers what to do when you reach a location in space, and how to do it.  It starts by listing overall design factors which affect multiple parts of a project.  Having accounted for propulsion in Part 2, we then explore the other subsystems that make up a complete system item.  A large program or project will consist of multiple system items with different purposes and functions.  The remainder of Part 3 covers the engineering methods that are specific to these functions.  This includes obtaining resources, turning those resources into useful materials and parts, assembly and construction, verification and test, operation and maintenance, and finally recycling and disposal.  A particular method describes in general '''how''' a given task is done.  Once completed, an engineering design then implements that method in a specific device.

The approach to date for most space projects has been to do all the design and construction on Earth, and then launch pre-built and pre-supplied hardware such as communication satellites or interplanetary probes as complete items.  That is adequate for smaller projects, but as larger ones are contemplated this method becomes unreasonably difficult and expensive.  The International Space Station is an example where it was too large to launch as one complete item, with supplies for it's full operating life.  Instead it was assembled from smaller parts that each fit within a single rocket launch, and supplies are delivered periodically.  This reduced the payload per launch to a manageable size, but all the parts and supplies are still being brought from Earth.  

As larger and more distant projects are considered, the transport requirements continue to go up, and this starts to become very expensive.  This is mainly due to the deep gravity well of the Earth, which requires a lot of energy to climb out of.  At some point it becomes more economical for a project to extract supplies and energy, and eventually do production, locally.  So we give a lot of attention to these tasks.  Although doing them in space is new, there is a long history of engineering on Earth which can serve as a starting point.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;Part 4: Complex Programs&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

Having looked in part 3 at the elements of a single system, Part 4 considers complex programs that are extended in time or involve multiple systems.  A key point to understand is no single system works best in isolation.  For example, a vehicle without a fuel supply can only travel once, with it's original fuel load.  A fuel extraction plant can do nothing without raw materials to work on.  Combining these, a vehicle can transport raw materials to the plant, and get fuel from the plant for later trips.  Then the combined system can operate indefinitely as long as a surplus of fuel is produced from each trip.  So to design a complete program, you need to look at all the component systems and how they interact.

In addition to the parts of a program interacting at a given point in time, it can also evolve over time.  An analogy can be made to road systems on Earth.  They started as footpaths, and were upgraded over time.  The upgrades were not independent of the types of vehicles that used them, and the existing roads were used to deliver machinery and supplies to construct the upgraded roads.  So it will be with sensibly designed large space projects - using one set of vehicles and facilities to help build the next level of improvements.

We give an extensive example of a complex program that both interacts with itself and grows over time.  This example serves several purposes.  One is to demonstrate by example how such a program is analyzed and defined.  Where alternative options are presented, we explain how to choose among them.  Another purpose is to serve as an actual proposed plan to implement in real life.  In that context you have to go past pure design questions and consider cost and other external factors that apply to a real project.  The final purpose is as a &quot;class project&quot; or &quot;lab experiment&quot; method of learning.  Things like working in a team are best learned by doing, and using new knowledge in a project helps fix it in memory.  Taking an unfinished part of our example to the next level of design detail can be used for this purpose.  Experience working on a realistic design can be useful if someone intends to work in this field in the future.

Our proposed program is likely not the best one imaginable, but it is intended as a good starting point.  As individuals and teams make suggestions and apply engineering effort to it we hope it will improve over time, both as an actual project proposal, and as a teaching tool.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;Part 5: Design Studies&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

In this part we include or link to the details of design studies for elements of the program described in Part 4, and other studies done as examples.  This allows the narrative in the earlier parts of the book to flow without interruption by a mass of detail, and also serves as examples of the types of studies and reports which engineers are frequently asked to work on.  The full details showing the step by step assumptions and calculations are usually kept as part of a program's work history, and the results are distributed as reports for others to use.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;References and Sources&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

We provide links to references and additional data in two main ways.  References or sources that are specific to one method or idea are linked in the main body of the book.  In-line links are boldface and capitalized.  Additional references that cover multiple topics are included in this last section, along with appendices for data that does not fit in the main narrative.  The first appendix, for example, lists fictional transport methods which do not have any scientific or engineering support.  They are there for completeness, but as there are no practical prospects to use them, we put them in a separate section rather than the main body of the book.  Additional Appendices include reference data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origin of This Wikibook ==

This wikibook was originated as a port of the &quot;Canonical List of Space Transportation and Engineering Methods&quot; by Dani Eder (wiki account Danielravennest).  The latest version I had prepared of that document (version 0.79, 26 July 2001) was on Geocities. A saved copy can be found at [http://www.oocities.org/danielravennest/CanonicalList.html oocities.org]

I worked for Boeing for 24 years on space related projects.  Over the years I accumulated a lot of information on space propulsion and development.  I started keeping a list of references organized by topic, which grew into the above document.  As the internet developed, it was posted at various times, eventually ending up as a geocities web page.

An article entitled &quot;60 Ways to Leave Your Planet&quot; by W. Dan Leonard appeared in &quot;Final Frontier&quot; magazine about the list (May/June 1990, page 42).

I hope in this wikibook form it can develop further into a useful reference. [[User:Danielravennest|Danielravennest]] ([[User talk:Danielravennest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Danielravennest|contribs]]) 05:59, 27 February 2012 (UTC)

== Status ==

: '''Initial Outline Progress'''

Based on age of the original Canonical List from which this book originated, other documents I plan to merge, and amount of text in the various sections, I estimated progress towards an &quot;initial outline&quot; to be: 

* text completion: 25% @ 4 March 2012 - illustrations, tables, and scanned media: 1% , references and notes: 4% 
* text completion: 37% @ 14 March 2012
* text completion: 45% @ 24 March 2012
* text completion: 60% @ 6 April 2012
* text completion: 80% @ 23 April 2012
* Text completion: 100% @ 16 May 2012.

Initial outline meant the structure of the book was complete, and many sections had some level of text completion, but there are still significant holes.  From this point the goal was to add more illustrations and references, fill holes, and improve the text and presentation.

: '''First Draft Progress'''

First draft means all the book sections have substantial text, and supporting works (technical papers, design studies, spreadsheets) are partially done. Quantity is not a substitute for quality, but I have set a target of 500 equivalent pages of 500 words each as &quot;textbook length&quot;, or 250,000 words x 6 bytes/word average.  I have also arbitrarily set a goal of 1 link/reference per 200 words and 1 graphic (table, illustrations, and similar) per 1000 words.  This just lets me keep track of progress as I work on my contributions.  Based on those targets, the status was:

* 16 May 2012: Text 40%, Graphics and References not yet counted
* 05 Jul 2012: Text 52%, Graphics 8%, References 28%
* 02 Sep 2012: Text 60%, Graphics 10%, References 47%
* 08 Jan 2013: Text 93%, Graphics 8%, References 37% (graphics and references percentage regressed because they are relative to a larger text base)

== Merge ==

I see no reason to repeat the description of every kind of rocket in 2 different places.
I see 2 ways to avoid this unnecessary repetition:
* (a) I suggest merging the entire book [[Rocket Propulsion]] into [[Space Transport and Engineering Methods]], creating one huge book. Or,
* (b) Pull all the &quot;rocket propulsion stuff&quot; out of the &quot;Space Transport and Engineering Methods&quot; book and put it in the &quot;Rocket Propulsion&quot; book, leaving 2 books: &quot;Space Transport and Engineering Methods (except for rocket propulsion)&quot; and &quot;Rocket Propulsion&quot;.

I'm leaning towards (a), but you may be able to convince me to do (b).

'''Merge Progress'''

Merge complete.  How do we review the merge and then delete the other book?

:I have posted a partial answer on David's talk. A simple review is made by the acting administrator (but only on the use of the content not a real quality assessment) as you tag the pages with the now merged tag you provide the destination page indication that is probably missing on your edit comments.
:I've looked at the last ones and have only a merge indication (not the source), not a major issue but makes a second person to fallow and do a review extremely complex if only working on them.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:27, 17 April 2012 (UTC)


== Regarding content ==
Shouldn't content that is not about space transport and it's engineering methods be moved to other works. I noticed that there are some sections covering colonization and prolonged stays, even terraforming considerations that would be best merged into [[Colonizing Outer Space]].
Any views on this (not urgent) but it seems that the material may be missed under the current title and/or duplicated on the other work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:48, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

:The book title means 'Space Transport Methods' + 'Space Engineering Methods' as distinct topics with one part of the book dedicated to each.  Colloquially the first is how you get there, and the second is what you do once you are there.  As the Introduction makes clear, you cannot consider them in isolation.  A vehicle is no use without a refueling station, for example, or a space colony is of no use if you don't have a way to get people there.  The Combined Systems section then gives an extended example of how you put the pieces together, including calculations, to make a logical sequence.  I know the book has holes, like illustrations are pretty much non-existent, but I hope that clarifies the direction I was heading in. [[User:Danielravennest|Danielravennest]] ([[User talk:Danielravennest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Danielravennest|contribs]]) 00:15, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

::Then renaming of this work to something like Exploring/Understanding/A look into/Past and Future of/etc Space Engineering (something that doesn't define or limit the scope) and merging Colonizing Outer Space may seem in order no ? 
::In regards to Transport and Colonization I do not see them as strongly connected but do in regards to Engineering. When we discuss future colonization efforts (specifically) we need to cover not only engineering matters but social, political, economical and even architectural and cultural aspects.
::Transportation is only relevant until an optimal solution to the different requirements is found after that technologies will compete more on economical costs and trip time then in specifically Engineering concerns.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:44, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

::I was referring specifically the content in chapter 4 section 9,10,11 and 12. Except a brief requirement to cover future transport methodologies (that is already present in the other book) all content has little to do with Engineering (being Engineering a precises application of science for the creation and application of reproducible methodologies,processes and systems).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:00, 23 April 2012 (UTC)

:::I agree that colonization is a much wider topic.  Looking historically, colonizing the New World (Americas) involved all those aspects you mentioned. What kind of ships they used and what tools were brought along is only a small part of the story, and I didn't intend to cover all aspects of colonization. MIT calls the field I intended to cover &quot;Space Systems Engineering&quot; [http://mit.edu/aeroastro/academics/grad/spacesystems.pdf], so I would be OK with that for a title. I note, however, that engineers design things for other people, and analyzing what it is they want (requirements analysis) is part of the process which cannot be ignored. So for example if you set the problem as &quot;design a transportation system to support a Mars Colony&quot;, you then have to ask how many people, when do they get there, and how self-sufficient they are. That last item affects how much you need to transport. So to find the optimum solution you have to consider the Mars greenhouses as well as what kind of engine is on your rocket. That sort of &quot;looking at the whole problem&quot; is what Systems Engineers do, and what I did as a systems engineer at Boeing's space division.  For now, I just want to finish writing the content.  What title to put on it and how it's organized can come later. {{unsigned3|Danielravennest}}

:::: I'm not pressing the issue since I was mainly doing small maintenance on the [[Colonizing Outer Space]] even if I have an appetency for the subject. The points I was calling attention is that I felt there was a minor collision between the works on the later chapters and that those did not really seem well fitted for the subject matter covered in the rest of the book.
:::: I take your point about mission designs but reading the work so far one is given the idea that mission designs should tendentiously evolve to be more generic and avoid being target specific (as much as they can) this not only reduces costs ans eases planing and even avoids errors in the supply chain. We can revisit the subject later and look in more detail if colonization issues can be reduced here (linking to the other work that is specially focused in that) the same can also be done on the other work on the section that are best covered here (they should if separated complement each-other). 
:::: I do believe that a rename would improve readers placing the book into its scope, and agree that the subject of rename is also not pressing at the moment and could be done later on, but we seem to agree that it would be an improvement.
:::: I also make a minor personal comment. I disagree with the notion that &quot;engineers design things for other people&quot;. Engineers tend mostly to design things for other engineers :) Only the most basic of system and process engineering can be comprehended by one that is not initiated in the not so mysterious processes of science, physics, mathematics and logic. We live in an age that is marked by reaching the pinnacle of demographics, yet these marvelous knowledges are by most seen as arcane and unnecessary...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:29, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

== Cover Picture ==

Rather than a photo of the Space Station, which is a past project, I think a future project representative of the contents of the book would be better.  Something like a Lunar surface base illustration, with mining rovers, a structure being assembled, and a rocket vehicle.  For now the ISS photo is OK as a place holder.

== Some ideas ==
I particular would like this project more focused, but there are some aspects that could benefit what is covered information about how to deal with engine  vibration and heat and radiation shielding in all areas, would be interesting to have some coverage.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:23, 31 August 2012 (UTC)</text>

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

'''[[w:Engineering|Engineering]]''' applies scientific principles and other forms of knowledge to design, build, and operate systems which perform an intended function.  It is a broad discipline, whose parts we will discuss later in '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Engineering Specialties|Section 1.7 - Engineering Specialties]]'''.  In a simple project, such as designing a bookcase for home use, a formal engineering process is not needed.  One person can calculate the shelf loads and other parameters by themselves, with the help of a calculator and some reference data.  Large and complicated projects, however, need the knowledge of multiple specialists, must satisfy multiple desired conditions and functions, and involve large amounts of time and money.  A need then exists to coordinate the work, and ensure the final product meets the intended goal, in the most efficient way.  '''[[w:Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]]''' methods have been developed for this coordination task.  They have become their own specialty field and are used in addition to the other engineering specialties.  Systems Engineering can be used for any type of complex project.  However, space systems are usually complicated enough to benefit from it, and systems thinking and methodologies are often used in this field.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''What is a System?'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

[[File:E0.0_Combined_System_Environment.png|thumb|right|720 px|Figure 1.5-1: Example system diagram showing inputs and outputs to system boundary.]]

Given an identified need or desire, how does one select the best design to satisfy it out of the infinite number of possible solutions?  For a complex project, the concept of a '''[[w:System|System]]''' has proven useful.  A System is defined as a functionally, physically, and/or behaviorally related group of regularly interacting or interdependent elements. They are distinguished from the rest of the Universe by a '''System Boundary''' (Figure 1.5-1).  A system is not a physical entity, but rather a mental construct, created because of it's usefulness, by drawing a line or surface around a collection of elements.  The elements have internal relationships to each other and form a comprehensible whole.  The rest of the Universe outside the system is referred to as the '''System Environment''', or simply the environment.  Flows of many types enter and leave the system as '''Inputs''' from and '''Outputs''' to the environment by crossing the system boundary .  The scope of a given engineering task is then defined by the system boundary, what crosses the boundary, and what is inside.  Systems may contain smaller systems within them, which are called '''Subsystems'''.  These may be nested to any level, but flows into and out of a subsystem must appear in the parent system, or at the top level in the environment.  This rule may be called '''Conservation of Flows''' - that flows do not appear from or vanish into nothing.  Following that rule ensures that all the required inputs and outputs are accounted for.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Systems Engineering Method'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

A single person may have the time and knowledge to do a preliminary concept or design.  A complete space project is usually too complex or would take too long for one person to do.  So the '''[[w:Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]]''' method can be used to help carry out such projects.  Aerospace projects, including space systems, are particularly suitable due to their complexity, and were among the main ones for which the method was developed.  The method focuses on how projects should be designed and managed over their entire '''Life Cycle''', that being from initial concept to final disposal.  Since it applies to the whole project, it is interdisciplinary, connecting tasks performed by Systems Engineering specialists to those of other engineering branches. Key parts of the process include:

* Breaking down a complicated project in such a way that the smallest pieces are simple enough for humans to design. 
* Modeling the system so it can be analyzed and optimized, and comparing the actual physical system to the models.
* Control and track the information and design of the pieces and their relationships so the total system will do what you wanted.

[[File:Generalized_System_Engineering_Steps.PNG|thumb|right|275 px|Figure 1.5-2]]

Figure 1.5-2 illustrates in general the steps within the Systems Engineering process.  The trend is from top to bottom, but we do not show arrows connecting the steps because it is not a strict linear flow.  As results are obtained in any task, they can feed back to earlier steps in an iterative fashion, until a stable design solution is reached.  So these tasks can happen in parallel, and applied across the different stages of the life cycle.  The tasks can also be applied at different levels of detail.  They are started at a general level.  Once a stable configuration is reached at one level, it then is re-applied at lower levels until detailed design can be done on individual elements.  At all levels, there is communication with design specialties, and with outside entities such as the customer, suppliers, and other scientific and engineering organizations.  The steps are described in more detail in sections 3 and 4 below and on page 2.  It should be noted that an organization capable of designing and building complex space systems is itself a complex system.  While it is not often done, Systems Engineering methods can be applied to the organization itself to design and optimize how it functions, or to any complex system of any type, not just space hardware.  

The systems engineering process is bounded by natural and human-made constraints.  Many of the human constraints are not directly related to design in the way physical properties of materials are.  These indirect constraints include economics, laws, and safety of life and property.  The process is then also outward-looking, beyond the design itself.  Other engineering specialties are more focused on the internal details of the design. 

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Large Scale Systems'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

It is not required that a single organization do all the Systems Engineering tasks.  Some very large systems, that have been deliberately engineered, such as the US Interstate highway system, the Internet, and the US program to land humans on the Moon, involved many entities working together.  A national system of government, human civilization, or the Earth's biosphere can be considered as very large systems in terms of having inputs and outputs, a system boundary, and an external environment.  There is a growing understanding that such large entities are systems composed of many smaller systems, whether designed or not.  Analyzing such large entities as systems can help with understanding how they function and determining if corrective action is needed.  Although some attempts at designing governments have been made, they have yet to be done based on scientific and engineering principles.  '''[[w:Climate_engineering|Climate Engineering]]''', which is the concept of deliberately affecting the Earth's climate, is an example of biosphere level engineering projects.  Doing them deliberately, as opposed to the inadvertent side effect of civilization, is still in the conceptual stage.  More work has been done in the field of Economics in analyzing economic systems, and sometimes attempting to design or influence them.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Reference Sources'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

As a well-developed engineering specialty, there are a number of reference books, standards, and special methods and software used by systems engineers.  They are used to understand and manage the interactions, and communicate the current state, of a complex project.  The remainder of Part 1 of this book summarizes parts of the systems engineering method.  This includes  the elements of a system, engineering tools, involvement of other design specialties, and economics.  A given program also has to be understood in the context of other existing and future programs.  All of these tools and knowledge must be integrated properly for a new project.

==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''The System Life Cycle'''&lt;/font&gt;==

[[File:Systems_Engineering_Linear_Life_Cycle_Stages.PNG|thumb|right|720 px|Figure 1.5-3 - Linear life cycle stages.]]

Complex systems evolve through a '''[[w:System_lifecycle|Life Cycle]]''' much the way living things do, from conception to disposal.  The life cycle is divided into a number of stages where different tasks are performed (Figure 1.5-3). The design stages (the first three boxes in the figure) can be organized in different ways depending on the nature of the system.  These include linear, parallel, spiral, or closed loop sequences, or some mixture of these.  The illustration shows a typical linear sequence.  A spiral process repeats stages in increasing detail, while a closed loop repeats at the same level of detail.  Beyond the design stages, the process is more typically linear from production, through test, installation, operation, and retirement.  

Life cycle stages are used for two important reasons.  First, the design process should consider all the later stages, so that the best total solution is found, rather than optimizing for just one part of a system's life.  Second, breaking down a system by time is another way to simplify the design work, along with breaking it down by subsystems and components.  The stages are further broken down into internal tasks which have inputs and outputs that connect them, and have decision points for when it is time to proceed to the next stage.  

A life cycle is a time oriented view of an entire system.  Other views of the same system include functional diagrams, which show what tasks it performs and their inputs and outputs, and a work breakdown, which tabulates the elements and sub-elements which make up the system.  Which view of the system is used depends on the design task at hand, though all the views need to be kept current or the design process can become disjointed.

===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Life Cycle Example'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

The names, and the task contents, of a given project's stages can vary according to the needs of the project.  However a somewhat standard linear flow is often used in aerospace engineering, including space-related projects.  The stages and typical major tasks include:


:'''&lt;u&gt;Conceptual Design&lt;/u&gt;'''

* Identifying the need - what is it you want the system to do? This is embodied in goals and requirements.
* Establish selection criteria - how do you decide one design is better than another?
* Establish a system concept - this includes the main functions, operation, and maintenance of the system.
* Feasibility analysis - can the need be met at acceptable cost, schedule, and other parameters.


:'''&lt;u&gt;Preliminary Design&lt;/u&gt;'''

* Functional analysis - identify and break down the complex system into smaller functions and their relationships, including alternate arrangements
* Design Allocation - subdivide and assign requirements to lower tier functions
* Formulate alternatives - develop alternate solutions - what are the range of possible options?
* System Modeling - develop mathematical models of the system so variations can be assessed.
* Optimization and selection - making each option as good as it can be, then compare options and choose the best.
* Synthesis and definition - combining the selected options into a total design, and recording the configuration and requirements details


:'''&lt;u&gt;Detail Design&lt;/u&gt;'''

* Design - Once broken down to a low enough level, individual elements are assigned to engineering specialties or design teams to complete.  Design includes physical hardware components and facilities, as well as software, operating procedures, training, and other non-physical elements.  
* Integration - Design elements are combined into larger functional units that work together, up to the system as a whole.
* Engineering Models and Prototypes - Physical partial models and complete prototypes built to validate the design.



:'''&lt;u&gt;Fabrication and Assembly&lt;/u&gt;'''

* Production of components - For physical items, the step where you make the parts.
* Assembly - Putting parts together into complete elements.


:'''&lt;u&gt;Test and Verification&lt;/u&gt;'''

* Element and System Test - At each assembly level, testing that the assembly functions, then moving up to larger assemblies to the final product.  
* Verification -  Proving the system meets the stated design requirements, by a combination of test, demonstration, inspection, and analyses.


:'''&lt;u&gt;Installation and Deployment&lt;/u&gt;'''

:After production, the system elements may need delivery, installation, and activation at the location they will be used.


:'''&lt;u&gt;Operation and Maintenance&lt;/u&gt;'''

* Operation - Using the system for the purpose it was designed, in the intended environment.
* Support - which includes operator training, performance monitoring, and logistic support.
* Maintenance - includes planned maintenance and unplanned repair, and in-place upgrades.


:'''&lt;u&gt;Decommissioning&lt;/u&gt;'''

:When the system has reached the end of its useful life, the removal, recycling, and disposal of system elements, and return of former sites to their original conditions.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Life Cycle Engineering'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

As a process that applies across the whole life cycle, Systems Engineering is not just used in the initial design phase. Part of good design practice is to know when to stop designing. A design can always be improved with more work, but at some point additional work does not provide enough added improvement to justify it. At that point the design should stop, and the system progresses to the next stage, which is usually fabrication and assembly.  With time, the original design assumptions for a project, such as the available technology level, or launch to orbit traffic levels, will change.  The systems engineering process can then be re-applied to see if a design change, upgrade, or even complete replacement of the system is warranted.  Even if the system was optimally designed when first created, future events may require changes.  If the system was properly modeled and documented, then monitoring of these external changes will reveal when it is time to restart the engineering.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Requirements Analysis'''&lt;/font&gt;==

Developing a new system starts with a desire or need which cannot be satisfied by existing systems.  The needs and desires are expressed by a '''Customer''',   For systems engineering purposes, the direct customer is the person or entity who is paying for a project or can direct the engineering staff.  For example, in the Boeing Company, that is the engineering managers and general managers of the company.  The ultimate customers, which are airline passengers, cannot express their desires directly.  So the company management serves as a proxy to express their desires as an input to the engineering process.  Other methods, such as surveys, can be used to determine the desires of the ultimate customers.

The initial expression may be in the form of general verbal goals, system properties, levels of technical performance, and similar statements.  The customer also will have some value preferences which describe what a better design is from their point of view.  These can be things like &quot;minimum cost&quot;, &quot;minimum waste output&quot;, and &quot;maximum efficiency&quot;.

The first major systems engineering step, '''[[w:Requirements_analysis|Requirements Analysis]]''', is the process of converting these general customer desires and preferences to specific measurable features which can be used for design and evaluation.  Two main parts of this process are '''Requirements Definition''' and '''Measures of Effectiveness'''.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Requirements Definition'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

The highest level general desires are first converted to specific measurable features and values called '''System Requirements'''.  These are later broken down into more detailed lower level requirements, which are assigned to logical elements of a system called '''Functions''' to perform.  The assignment ensures that somewhere in the system all the top level goals are met.  At the most detailed level a subset of the lower level requirements are assigned to a single function box.  This now becomes the detailed design conditions for that function. Assuming the analysis has been carried to a low enough level, the detailed design of the element that performs the function can then be done with a reasonable effort.

The first step in requirements definition is documenting the original desire or need of the customer in as much detail as they can provide.  We will use as an example the Apollo program to land humans on the Moon.  That was expressed by President Kennedy as a '''[[w:We_choose_to_go_to_the_Moon|well known goal with a deadline]]'''.  That very general statement was not sufficient to design the hardware.  The key task is to put all the requirements in forms that can be measured so that you can tell when you meet them.  Experience shows if a desirable feature or parameter is not expressed and measured, it will not happen as desired.  An example of this failure is the '''[[w:Space_Shuttle_program|Space Shuttle Program]]'''.  The original goal was to fly 60 times a year. Given a fleet of 4 Orbiters, each one had to fly 15 times a year, or one launch per 24 days. Subtracting 7 days on orbit and one day before and after flight for launch preparations and post-landing recovery, that leaves 15 days to complete ground processing.  The stated goal was thus 160 hours for ground processing, composed of 2 shifts (16 hours) x 10 work days over two weeks, thus 14 days.  This goal was expressed, but it may not have been included in the system requirements, and it definitely was not allocated to lower tier hardware and tracked at the lower levels like hardware weight was.  

Only after the Shuttle was already flying was it noted that ground processing was taking too long, and efforts started to reduce it.  At that point it was too late to make any fundamental changes in the design, and so ground processing never got below about 800 hours, about 5 times the original goal.  This was a major contributor to the Shuttle never reaching its intended flight rate.  In order to have reached their goal of 160 hours, processing time would have had to be allocated to sub-systems, such as landing gear or maneuvering thrusters, and then each subsystem designed to meet it's assigned time.  Conversely to processing time, weight has always been a tracked parameter in aerospace systems, since airplanes cannot function if they are too heavy.  The Space Shuttle had very detailed weight targets and a tracking system by component, with monthly reports. It more or less reached its design payload, which is the 1.5% of available launch weight remaining after the vehicle hardware and fuel are accounted for.

This example emphasizes why desired features must not only be stated quantitatively, but passed down for engineers to meet in detailed design, and tracked so you can tell if you are going to meet them.  Measurable parameters can be a simple yes or no, for example &quot;Does this airplane design meet FAA regulations?&quot;, or it can be a numerical value, range of values, table, formula, or graph indicating the range of acceptable values for that system characteristic.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Measures of Effectiveness'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

Desired features are often in opposition.  For example, higher performance and reliability often come at the expense of higher cost.  There are also alternate designs which have different amounts of each feature.  Establishing '''Measures of Effectiveness''' is the quantitative method to account for these disparate features at the level of the whole system.  Like requirements, they are derived from customer desires.  In this case it is what features would be &quot;better&quot; when comparing one design over another.  Since different features typically have different units of measurement, they need to be converted to a common measuring scale.  This is done by formulas that convert each different value, such as cost or performance, to a score.  These scores are given relative weights based on their importance to the customer.  The weighted measures can then be used in a single mathematical model or formula to determine &quot;better&quot; as a total score, when the component values vary across different designs.  

The value scale is often in a range such as 0 to 100%, or 1 to 10, but this is arbitrary.  What is more important is a definite conversion from a measurable feature to a scoring value, and the relative weights and method of combining them to a total score.  As an example, a value of 0% might be assigned to a payload of 15 tons, and 100% to a payload of 45 tons, with a linear scale in between, and payload given an importance of 30% in the total score.  The total scoring system becomes a mathematical model of the customer's desires for the system.  Getting a customer to define &quot;better&quot; in such detailed numerical form is often difficult, because it removes their freedom to choose what they personally prefer in a design in spite of the engineering solution.  It is necessary, though, if you really want an optimal answer.  At the least this process makes it obvious when the customer is over-riding the engineering process.

It should always be kept in mind that a particular design solution may not be &quot;good enough&quot; in terms of of it's measures when compared to existing systems. This can be found by including the existing system as one of the alternative designs being scored.  In that case the proper answer is to stop development of the new system and stay with the existing ones.  Often the cause is not enough performance improvement relative to cost, but other measures can result in a decision to stop.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Requirements Types'''&lt;/font&gt;==

The following subheadings list major types of system requirements.  Not all would be relevant to a given project, and others besides these might be important to the customer, so it is presented as a starting point for consideration.  Each type can include more specific requirement values.  The types listed here are linked and somewhat overlapping.  For example high reliability and high safety generally go together.  Requirements set limits on a design, and overlaps between requirements in effect overlap the range of limits they impose.  This is acceptable as long as the designer understands the range of overlaps and interactions among the requirements.  A particular design parameter will be governed by the strictest requirement when there is such overlap.  An example from civil engineering is that earthquake, wind, and snow loads are all requirements to meet in a building design, and they overlap in that all of them affect the required strength of structural elements.

When broken down to lower levels of the system design, the requirement types and values will become more specific and detailed.  Care is needed to maintain logical and numerical consistency across system levels.  Requirements, or parts thereof, should not be inserted or dropped at lower levels.  '''Traceability''' is the ability to follow the chain of requirements across the system levels, and is maintained by documenting how they are connected.  This is necessary so you can prove satisfying the lowest level details actually meets the top level system goals.  Historically the first two requirement types, performance and cost, were the primary ones considered.  As systems have grown more complex and their outside interactions and side effects become better understood, the number of desirable features, and thus the number of requirements, have increased.  This trend is expected to continue in the future.

Aside from the biblical '''[[w:Ten_Commandments|Ten Commandments]]''', requirements are rarely set in stone.  Not all of them will be identified at the start of a project.  As a result of interaction with the customer and feedback from the design process, they can end up modified.  For example, a launch capacity of 10 launches at 100 tons each might be specified for a rocket, and later analysis show that 20 launches at 50 tons each yields lower total cost.  The requirements would then be modified to reflect that.  At any given time, however, the current set of requirements guides the engineering work.  Over time, requirements become more firmly fixed, generally from the higher to more detailed levels in sequence.  Changing a requirement forces rework of previous designs.  So the cost of changing a requirement grows later in the process, and this tends to exceed any benefit from the change.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Performance&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Performance requirements are measures of the primary intended function of a system.  Every system must have at least one performance measure for what it does, and often there are a number of them.  As an example, the design capacity for space transport systems is often expressed as a '''Mission Model'''.  The mission model quantifies the system performance in terms of multiple parameters like dates, flight rate, payload dimensions and mass, mission duration, destination orbit, type of cargo, and maximum g-level.  For a space habitat, performance might be measured in number of crew supported, levels of atmosphere, food supplies, and gravity, and total living volume.  An industrial system might have requirements for '''Throughput''', in tons per day of materials processed, and '''Efficiency''' in terms of (theoretical energy required)/(actual energy used).  The particular performance measures which matter will vary by system.  

An example mission model for the Apollo program might have started out as follows, with more detail added as the project progresses.  Even in this early version, it lists a number of different performance measures that the design needs to meet: 


'''Cargo characteristics:''' 

:Number of crew to the lunar surface: 2/mission 
:Maximum Stay time: 4 days/mission 
:Additional science equipment: 250 kg/flight 
:Lunar samples returned: 100 kg/flight 

'''Mission Schedule:''' 

:First Flight: as early as possible but before Jan 1, 1970 
:Flight quantity: 10 to lunar surface (this was the original plan) 
:Flight rate: 4 flights/year


Performance requirements only address what a system does when it is operating as intended.  It does not address what happens outside that context, such as

* In between active operation, such as the 80 days between Lunar missions in the mission model above. 
* When the system fails, as did the Apollo 13 mission,
* Before and after the 5 years of manned missions.  
* Interactions external to the program, such the supply of technical personnel for the project, environmental impact of the launches, or return of Lunar germs to Earth.  The last turned out to be a needless worry, but the quarantine system for returning astronauts and moon rocks is not something covered in performance measures.  

So performance alone does not encompass the entire system over the entire life cycle, and other requirement types are needed.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Cost&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Cost represents the net resource inputs to a project from outside the system.  Space projects don't use Dollars or Euro directly, but rather use them to pay for labor, materials, and services they do use.  So cost is a measure of flows across the system boundary, rather than an internal property of the system.  Every system will consume some resources during its life, but funding sources are not unlimited.  So cost limits are almost always considered a requirement, whether implicitly or explicitly.  Total cost over the entire life of the project is called '''[[w:Whole-life_cost|Life Cycle Cost]]'''.  This can be further broken down into development, production, and operations costs, and then accounted in much greater detail across the system elements.  In addition to total cost, limits can be placed on spending rates.  This is most explicit in government agency budgets, but even private projects have limits on spending per year.  Some systems generate revenue to offset costs.  When revenues exceed cost, the system as a whole generates a profit in financial terms.  Revenue may be delayed until after the design and construction phases and the system begins to operate.  The peak net cost accumulated until revenues exceed expenses is described as '''Capital or Development Costs'''.  Customers generally want high performance and low cost, so the ratio of performance/cost is often a key measure for a project.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Compliance&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Performance and cost requirements are set by the project's customer with the help the engineering team.  '''[[w:Regulatory_compliance|Compliance Requirements]]''' are set by external human rules such as laws, regulations, codes, and standards.  Human rules often set minimum requirements in areas like safety.  This does not prevent a system from adopting stricter levels.  Human rules are usually designed to prevent undesirable effects.  For example, speed limits on driving are intended to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents.  Compliance requirements exist whether or not they are explicitly incorporated into the engineering process.  It is better to incorporate them explicitly to avoid later problems.  Other requirements are set by nature, such as the minimum altitude for a stable Earth orbit.  These do not fall under compliance, but are accounted for elsewhere.  In the case of altitude, this might be a performance requirement that a rocket deliver the payload to a 250 km high orbit.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Technical Risk&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Especially in the early stages of design, the engineering process may reveal gaps in knowledge, performance uncertainties, resources which are not available, or other issues which prevent selection, optimization, or synthesis of a design.  These issues can prevent progress to the next stage of the project, or cause a final design which does not meet desired goals.  Measures of these unknowns are given the general name '''Technical Risks'''. For example, a new technology which has not been demonstrated yet, i.e. a fusion rocket, would be rated as high risk, while a chemical rocket, which has decades of operating history, would be comparatively low risk.  A mass budget considerably below past experience or with insufficient margin during preliminary design would be high risk.  New research, modeling, or prototyping can be done to reduce the risks, or the system modified to avoid them.  Before these risk reduction efforts the risks will still exist, and it is necessary to account for them.  Otherwise you accept the alternate risk of the system not performing as desired or even at all.  

Not every risk will be known at the start of a project, but sound engineering practice is to identify them as early as possible, and to allow for modifying development plans when they appear.  Depending on how much new technology is included in a project, sufficient performance, time, and cost margins should be included for unexpected problems caused by technical risks.  Technical risk is gradually retired during the design and production of a system.  Once a system is operating, a small uncertainty remains for things like operating life or failure rates.  These are not eliminated until the end of program operations.  Even after disposal of a system, some environmental risk may remain.  A prime example is nuclear waste, which is a hazard long after the reactor that created it has been demolished.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Safety&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

'''[[w:Safety|Safety]]''' is the state of being protected against adverse consequences to living things, or damage and destruction of inanimate objects.  It is an inverse measure of other risks than those under the previous heading.  So a higher safety level is measured by lower risks.  Under the principle of &quot;protecting the innocents&quot;, hazards to a crew that volunteers to accept a risk can be higher than those allowed to the public at large.  A safe system, such as a nuclear power plant or passenger airplane, may have less than one expected accident during the system life.  So safety often involves assessing low probability events.  Requirements to maintain control of a system despite failures, inherent fail-safe design, design margins, backup systems, and redundancy can improve safety when properly implemented.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Reliability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

'''[[w:Reliability_engineering|Reliability]]''' is the probability the system will perform its intended function for a specified time period.  The inverse is probability of failure.  It is related to '''Resilience''', which is the ability to function in the face of internal damage or external failures.  It is also related to '''Robustness''', which is the ability to function in the face of external or internal variables, such as line voltage or temperature.  A closely related measure is '''[[w:Availability|Availability]]''', which is the probability a system can start operating at a random requested time, or the percentage of a total time interval it can be operated.  A high reliability system may require multiple units in place, so that at least the minimum required number are available at a given time.  An example is passenger airplanes, which require multiple engines for high reliability, in case one stops working.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Durability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Durability is how long a system can perform its intended function. It is typically measured in terms of service life.  Service life of components, and of the system as a whole, is related to their maintenance.  If not enough maintenance is performed, the life is reduced.  Once the life of the item has been reached, it will need repair or replacement.  Service life can be measured in terms of number of uses, operating hours, or calendar time.  Durability is related to the economics concept of a '''[[w:Durable_good|Durable Good]]''', one that yields utility over time rather than being consumed in one use.  A passenger airplane has high durability, because it can operate for decades and tens of thousands of flights.  The opposite of durability is consumption.  The fuel used in the airplane is consumed (used only once), and is therefore not durable.  


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Quality&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

'''[[w:Quality_(business)|Quality]]''' is a measure of how well a system meets expectations.  One aspect of quality is a measure of the lack of variability or defects in the design and manufacturing stages of the life cycle.  Variability and defects increase the chance that performance will fall outside required levels.  Another way to put it is conformance to initial specifications.  Wear or defects caused during normal operation are not a quality problem unless they are unexpectedly large.  Normal wear would fall under maintenance requirements.  Another quality factor is parameters like signal-to-noise ratio and error rates in electronic devices.  Noise and quantum effects are natural variations which cannot be eliminated, but a large margin above those variations in effect reduces variability and increases quality.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Sustainability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

'''[[w:Sustainability|Sustainability]]''' is the capacity of a system to endure.  For example, does a system consume a scarce resource or generate a waste output that limits it's long term use?  If so, it is not sustainable over the long term, although it may last a desired system life.  A current example is hydrocarbon fueled rockets.  If obtained from fossil sources, they are both limited in supply, and cause unwanted change to the atmosphere.  If they are produced as a biofuel, they can be sustainable.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Community&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

These are requirements to have a positive, or at least minimally negative, impact on the surrounding human community.  This might mean employing local staff, or avoiding traffic problems during a shift change, or noise impact from rocket launches.  Positive educational impact is another community effect.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Environment&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Like community, these requirements relate to impact on the surroundings, but in this case the non-human portion.  For space projects a key environmental requirement is to avoid contamination, either biological, chemical, or from radiation, both forward and backward from the ends of the mission.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

This type of requirement covers items such as how many sources are there for a given manufacturing method, or how exacting the tolerances are.  In sum they measure how easy or hard the system is to produce.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Testing&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

These requirements deal with the types and quantity of tests required for a system.  Development tests occur during the design stage, qualification tests occur during approval, and periodic inspection and testing may be needed during the operations stage.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Maintenance&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

These requirements include parameters like hours and costs to maintain the system in an operating state, probability of system failure, and levels of spares required.  A system can fail without safety risk.  For example, your car may not start, which is different than the brakes failing to operate.  The more often that items fail to operate, the more spares are needed in stock, and the more time and money to repair or replace items.  So the various maintenance requirements are linked.  Maintenance requirements can be divided into preventive, which is before something stops working, and corrective, which is after.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Flexibility/Adaptability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

This is the ability of the system to adapt to new tasks or functions, or different performance levels for the original tasks, than first designed for.  Similar requirements come under names like '''Extension''', which is adding new tasks or functions while keeping the original ones, or '''Agility''', which is concerned with how fast the system can adapt. '''Reconfiguration''' is the ability to change the arrangement of a system to perform a different function.  An example is the Curiosity rover, which had one physical shape and software load to cover travel to and landing on Mars, and a different arrangement of wheels, camera mast, and software for surface operations. The change of state was accomplished by a combination of mechanical design, planned sequence, and new software upload.  


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Scalability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

This is the ability of the system to change in size either by scaling the size of a unit, or by installing more units.  There is always a limit to scaling imposed by some physical constraint.  If the system can be scaled to meet the full demand for it without reaching scaling limits, it can be said to be scalable.  '''[[w:Modularity|Modularity]]''' is a related parameter, concerned with how separate the elements of the system are, and how easy it is to replace them with other elements of the same or different types.  Instances of modularity can be horizontal - at the same level of a system, or vertical, as in the layers of the Internet Protocol stack.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Evolution&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

This requirement type considers how well the system can change over time to a different type of system.  It is related to flexibility, which is more about changes while staying the same kind of system. '''Redesign''' is concerned with the difficulty and cost of making changes.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Usability&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

Usability requirements deal with the interface between humans and system elements.  When a system can be used without great amounts of planning, preparation, physical strain, or training it is said to have high usability.


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Interoperation&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

This is a measure of how the system fits with other systems.  For example, a new airplane with doors that did not fit existing gates, or a computer network that exclusively uses a new protocol that nobody else uses would fail in this parameter. '''Compatibility''' is more concerned with the direct interfaces between systems, such as the output of a computer video card matching the input to a monitor.  These features are more prominent in the information technology fields because of the sheer number and variety of hardware and software elements which must work together (with varying degrees of success).


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:110%;line-height:1.5em;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Openness&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;

This is the degree to which a system is composed of proprietary or secret elements compared to open, public, or standard elements.

&lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt;{{TOCright}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

Space transport generally involves the application of forces to get to a desired location.  The comprehensive listing of space transport methods found in Part 2 of this book can be categorized in two dimensions, as shown in the &quot;Table of Space Transport Methods&quot; at the start of that section.  The X (horizontal) dimension is how the motive force is applied, and Y (vertical) dimension is the source of the energy used.  (See also '''[[w:Spacecraft_propulsion|Spacecraft Propulsion]]''' at Wikipedia for another list of methods.)  This section will discuss the forces, and section '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Energy|1.4 Energy Sources]]''' will discuss the energy sources.  Transport methods can also be categorized by parameters like state of development, exhaust velocity, or efficiency.  Section '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Comparisons_Among_Methods|2.11 - Comparisons]]''' will consider these other parameters.  We list all known forces considered for transport, without regard to practicality or state of development.  How to select the best option for a given transport task will be covered later. 

Propulsive forces can be divided into two large groups. The first group develop reaction forces from internal material which is expelled from the vehicle. The second group are forces generated by interacting with an entity outside the vehicle.  The law of conservation of momentum (i.e the sum of changes in mass times velocity for the parts of a system is zero) requires that the force you impart to the object you want to move is matched by an equal and opposite force on something else.  That something else can be mass you expel from the object, or an outside entity, but in either case the combined forces must be zero.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Reaction from Expelled Mass'''&lt;/font&gt;==

Vehicles which use this type of force production are generally called '''[[w:Rocket|Rockets]]''', and the devices which expel the materials are generally called '''Engines''' or '''[[w:Rocket_engine|Rocket Engines]]'''.  Specific types each have a descriptive or or common name noted later in the book where they are discussed.  The forces generated by an expelled material are derived from '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Physics#Newton.27s_Laws|Newton's Laws]]'''.  Where F is force, ''dm/dt'' is amount of mass expelled per time, and ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is exhaust velocity, the force can be found by


:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{dm}{dt} v_e &lt;/math&gt;


For accelerating vehicles, we call the force '''[[w:Thrust|Thrust]]''' and give it the symbol T.  From this equation we can see the possible ways to increase thrust are (1) increase the mass flow rate, (2) increase the exhaust velocity, or (3) some combination of both.  The available material to expel, also known as '''[[w:Working_mass|Reaction Mass]]''' or '''[[w:Propellant|Propellant]]''', is finite when coming from an internal source.  So it is usually preferable to increase velocity to get more total performance.  Because this type of propulsion system is self-contained, it can operate in many environments, particularly the vacuum of space.


'''Exhaust Velocity'''

[[File:STS-044_shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|320x479px|Figure 1.3-1 - Space Shuttle solid booster exhaust emitted as a cone of gas.]]

A parallel, unidirectional flow has all the mass expelled in a single direction.  An expanding gas is generally emitted as a cone with some angular width (see Figure 1.3-1).  Molecules not moving parallel the axis of the cone only contribute the parallel component of their motion parallel to the reaction force.  This component is found from the cosine of the angle of motion times the molecular velocity.  Molecules in an expanding gas also have a range of velocities determined by their temperature and how the flow was shaped.  The average axial component over the whole flow is called the '''Exhaust Velocity'''.  A derived unit is '''[[w:Specific_impulse|Specific Impulse]]'''.  Where T is thrust, &lt;math&gt;\dot{m_p}&lt;/math&gt; is propellant flow rate, and ''g'' is standard Earth gravity it is defined as


:&lt;math&gt;I_{sp} = {T \over \dot{m_p}g}&lt;/math&gt;


The units for specific impulse are in seconds, and are interpreted as how many seconds one unit of fuel can produce one unit of thrust at 1 gravity.  As an example, the high energy propellant combination of &lt;math&gt;H_2 + O_2&lt;/math&gt; produces a specific impulse of about 450 seconds.  Exhaust velocity in meters/second is is the preferred SI unit, since that is not Earth-centric by using the level of Earth gravity in the calculation.

In the list that follows, the approximate range of exhaust velocities is noted, and the list is generally in increasing order.  Note that what we mainly use today (combustion gas) is among the lowest in performance.  To achieve higher mission velocities than the characteristic exhaust velocity you can use large amounts of propellent, stack multiple stages of the same method, or use multiple different methods.


====A. Bulk Solids (0-10 km/s)====

Solid pellets or slugs are expelled via mechanical devices such as a rotary centrifuge, or an electromagnetic accelerator such as the '''[[w:Mass_driver#Spacecraft-based_mass_drivers|Mass Driver Reaction Engine]]'''.  The advantage is being able to use nearly any solid material as the reaction mass.  One disadvantage is the relatively low exhaust velocity compared to Ion and Plasma engines.  The extra work in extracting a suitable fuel for the latter types is usually much less than the gain from using 5-10 times less reaction mass.  Another is the creation of a debris impact hazard by emitting large numbers of uncontrolled objects.  A centrifuge or mass driver launching bulk mass from a body which is collected in orbit does not create the same impact hazard, even though it uses the same kind of devices.  Mechanical devices are like centrifuges are limited to fairly low velocity, and have not generally been considered for space transport.


====B. Microparticles (0 - 4 km/s)====

In addition to using bulk solid, finely powdered solid microparticles or droplets such as from inkjet type devices may be accelerated by electrostatic forces after giving them an electrical charge.  Advantages of this method are using unprocessed rock dust or single fluids, and enabling very small engines.  Compared to bulk solids, microparticles or droplets are less of an impact hazard, though they may pose a contamination problem.  Disadvantages include only working well in a vacuum or a very low density non-conducting medium.  Any appreciable outside pressure would stop the microparticles by drag or collision.   Relative to ion engines, the charge to mass ratio is lower, so the same electrostatic voltages result in lower exhaust velocity and less performance.


====C. Gas Flow (0.1 - 10 km/s)====

While in theory you can eject a liquid to obtain thrust, in almost all cases better performance can be gotten using a gas.  This is due to the higher average molecule velocity and ability to extract energy from the gas expansion.  So liquid is skipped among the solid-liquid-gas states of matter as a reaction method.  However liquids are a useful as a way to store reaction mass due to higher density and lower vapor pressure.  Higher pressures require more storage tank mass. 

Gas flow includes ambient temperature gas such as the Nitrogen &quot;cold gas&quot; thrusters used in spacesuit maneuvering backpacks.  Cold gas thrusters are useful when you don't want to damage hardware with a hot or chemically reactive exhaust plume, but they are very low performance (~0.5 km/s).  Heating a low molecular weight gas (i.e. Hydrogen) allows much better performance due to the higher average molecule velocity.  At sufficiently high temperature (around 3000K) the Hydrogen molecules will start to decompose to individual atoms, further increasing velocity.  There are numerous possible methods of heating the gas, including electric discharge through the gas (arcjet), concentrated sunlight (solar-thermal), electric filament heaters (resistojet), or heat from a nuclear reactor (nuclear-thermal).
 

====D. Combustion Gas (2 - 5 km/s)====

In this method, hot gas is generated by chemical reactions in the propellant.  For rockets the hot gas is expelled via a supersonic expansion exit nozzle.  That type of nozzle produces the highest velocity in a narrow stream.  Performance is limited by the reaction energy in the propellant, which is a maximum of about 15 MJ/kg for non-exotic fuel combinations.  This provides a maximum of 5.5 km/s exhaust velocity in theory, and 4.5 km/s in practice.  For atmospheric jet engines, some of the energy in the gas is used to drive a turbine and bypass fan blades, which greatly increases the affected mass flow.  The remainder is expelled by a nozzle, but the nozzle is typically a simpler geometry.  The use of external oxygen extracted from the air flow, and bypass air for mass flow, dramatically reduces the rate of fuel use, but also limits the flight velocity due to drag and heating.  

[[File:Hybrids_big.png|thumb|right|768x160px|Figure 1.3-2 - Hybrid rocket concept with liquid Oxidizer (blue) and solid fuel grain (green).]] 

There are several types of combustion gas rockets.  A '''[[w:Monopropellant|Monopropellant]]''' has a single ingredient which is decomposed and heated by passing over a catalyst bed.  A '''[[w:Liquid_rocket_propellant#Bipropellants|Bi-Propellant]]''' has two ingredients, a fuel and an oxidizer, which are generally mixed and burned in a '''[[w:Combustion_chamber|Combustion Chamber]]'''.  In a '''[[w:Liquid-propellant_rocket|Liquid Rocket]]''' the two ingredients are stored in liquid form in separate propellant tanks, although one or both may be converted to gas before reaching the combustion chamber. In a '''[[w:Hybrid_rocket|Hybrid Rocket]]''' one of the ingredients is in solid form (usually the fuel), and the other in liquid form. In a '''[[w:Solid-fuel_rocket|Solid Rocket]]''' all the ingredients are in a finely mixed powder which has been cast into a solid form. A typical solid rocket formulation has an oxidizer like '''[[w:Ammonium_perchlorate|Ammonium Perchlorate]]''' (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and a complex fuel containing powdered aluminum, rubber, and epoxy, which both binds all the ingredients together and is part of the fuel being burned.

There are a large number of combinations of form and fuel mixtures for rockets, but only a few are used with any frequency.  Because of the high thrust-to-mass ratio and ability to work in many environments, combustion gas systems have been by far the most popular for space transport so far, and almost exclusively the one for launch to Earth orbit.  Their disadvantage is that the exhaust velocity of the best propellants is about half the necessary velocity, including various losses, to reach Earth orbit.  Solving the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation (section 1.2), we find the mass ratio is at least 7.4, which leaves only 13.5% of liftoff mass for the vehicle and payload.  The best propellant includes liquid Hydrogen as the fuel, which is very low density, so keeping the vehicle mass low enough for reasonable payload is difficult.  If a denser and lower performance fuel is chosen, less structural mass is needed for propellant tanks, but the mass ratio is higher.  This still leaves small payload mass.  Until now, the solution has mainly been to use the rocket once, which allows lighter hardware, and discarding part of the hardware once some of the propellant has been used (staging).  This is an expensive solution.  For the future, a better approach is to move away from chemical rockets and their limited fuel energy in relation to what is needed to leave Earth.  That will allow more of the vehicle mass to be hardware and payload, and less to be fuel.  Designs can then be more robust and used many times, and the cargo can be a larger fraction of liftoff mass.  The combination will drastically reduce costs.


====E. Plasma (5 - 200 km/s)==== 

In this category the propellant is heated to the point that the atoms disassociate into charged components (ions and electrons), then directed out of the '''[[w:Plasma_propulsion_engine|Plasma Engine]]''' with magnetic fields.  Heating can be accomplished by a vigorous electric discharge, intense microwaves, laser, or internal heating in a fusion plasma.  Plasmas are hot enough to melt most materials, including the ones used for the rest of the engine, so they are usually contained by a magnetic field.  Alternately the plasma density (and hence the thrust) can be kept low enough that the engine can disperse the heat gained.  There is no theoretical limit to how hot a plasma can be.  Since the kinetic energy of the exhaust increases as the square of the velocity, there is a practical limit based on how much energy you can supply.  Plasmas can be physically confined by magnetic fields, but they also emit light that escapes to their surroundings.  The surface of the Sun, for example, is a 5780 K plasma.  So heating of the engine components will also limit a practical design.  Many plasma confinement techniques derive from fusion research, which deals with extremely hot plasmas.  Recent development of superconducting coils improves their efficiency, so design of effective plasma engines is fairly recent.  Because their exhaust velocities can be ten or more times higher than for combustion gas, plasma engines are in active development, but have not reached operational use as of 2016.


====F. Ions (2 - 200 km/s)====

[[File:Electrostatic_ion_thruster-en.svg|thumb|right|480x331px|Figure 1.3-4 - Electrostatic ion engine.]] 

Ions are atoms from which one or more electrons have been removed.  In an '''[[w:Electrostatic_ion_thruster|Ion Engine]]''' the propellant is first ionized using electron bombardment or RF oscillations (Figure 1.3-4).  The positive ions, which represent nearly all the mass, are accelerated across a voltage gradient to high velocity.  The voltage gradient can be a set of metal screens, or a charged plasma.  To maintain overall charge balance across the vehicle, an electron gun separately emits negative charges, or the ions recombine in the charged plasma. Once outside the engine the combined emission is electrically neutral so that the vehicle does not accumulate a net charge.  Compared to a plasma, an ion beam is generally lower density, so requires lower power levels to operate and generates lower thrust.  The main difference is creating high ion velocity via electric forces rather than heating.  Efficiency in converting power to thrust is similar (60-75%), as is maximum exhaust velocity.  Like plasma engines, the energy required rises as the square of exhaust velocity.  Practical limits on the power source then limits performance.  Because ion engines can operate with less overhead in small sizes than plasma engines, and are derived from vacuum tube technology, they were developed earlier.  

Ion engines are in use, as of 2016, on many communications satellites, and a few planetary spacecraft where high total mission velocity is needed.  In the future we expect their use to increase, along with the larger plasma engines, because they use an order of magnitude less propellant than chemical rockets.  In addition, the last 20 years has seen the development of lightweight and efficient solar panels to provide power for them.  Their disadvantage is low thrust, so they cannot be used on their own for launch or landing on large bodies.  This can be overcome by combining them with other methods.
   

====G. Atomic Particles (1000 km/s to near c)====

Atomic particles include nuclei of atoms from which all electrons have been removed, single electrons, neutrons, or protons, or more exotic particles such as muons.  Whereas an ion engine typically uses a single voltage gradient, a particle accelerator has multiple chambers that add successive amounts of energy to the particles.  This enables exhaust velocities up to near the speed of light, ''c'' , or 299,792 km/s.  Another method is direct emission of atomic particles from fission decay, fusion reactions, or antimatter decay.  These have particle velocities that are a significant fraction of ''c''.  Charged particles (generally those besides neutrons) can be directed by magnetic or electric fields, while neutral particles must be allowed to leave in one direction and absorbed in the others to produce net thrust.   Although accelerators on Earth have reached very close to c, which is the universal speed limit, no space mission has yet required this high a performance.  So this reaction method remains theoretical at present.

In this category is the '''[[w:Bussard_ramjet|Bussard Ramjet]]''' concept, which is a kind of fusion rocket.  Rather than carry all the fuel on-board, it uses a huge electromagnetic field as a ram scoop to collect and compress hydrogen from the interstellar medium.  The field compresses the hydrogen until fusion occurs, then directs the energy as rocket exhaust, accelerating the vessel.  The difference between the incoming interstellar gas pressure and outgoing exhaust provides the thrust.  The Bussard Ramjet currently has conceptual difficulties and is very far from being used.


====H. Photon Emission (1.0c exactly)====

Photon momentum is calculated by E/c, where E is the energy and c is the speed of light.  Thrust is then P/c where P is the power of the emission.  Direct emission of photons, while low in thrust, has the highest possible exhaust velocity.  For practical use, an extremely high energy source needs to be used, such as fusion or antimatter decay.  Fairly simple thermal (black body) emission and reflector arrangements can align the light beam to produce useful thrust.  A laser aligns the light very accurately, but the gain is small compared to a light beam with a width of a few degrees.  The momentum contribution for an off-axis photon is cosine(a), where a is the off axis angle.  For small angles that is very close to 1.0. Like atomic particles, no space transport mission has needed this high a performance, so it is a theoretical method at present.

Unbalanced photon emission as an incidental effect has been noted for the '''[[w:Pioneer_anomaly|Pioneer]]''' spacecraft and with respect to small asteroids, where it is called the '''[[w:Yarkovsky_effect|Yarkovsky Effect]]'''.  However these accelerations are very small and not intentional.  For useful propulsion a very large amount of photon energy needs to be emitted in a chosen direction.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Discussion'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

'''Split Energy Source:'''

Many of the above listed propulsion methods have separate propellant mass and energy to accelerate that mass.  With these methods there is a design trade between mass and energy.  The equation above gives force as mass flow rate times exhaust velocity.  To get a desired mission velocity change, or &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;, you can minimize the mass used, and use a lot of energy to generate a high exhaust velocity.  Alternately you can minimize energy and accelerate a larger propellant mass.  It is a trade-off where using more of one requires less of the other.  The kinetic energy required for a given exhaust velocity is KE = mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2, so it increases faster than the mass flow is reduced.  Typically engine efficiency is relatively constant in the normal operating range.  So source power level, which is KE/efficiency, also tends to increase as the square of exhaust velocity.  Higher power levels require more power source mass, and represent overhead beyond the cargo you are delivering.  Whether that mass increases linearly with power level or not will affect the optimum exhaust velocity.  In addition, the choice of completing the mission in the least time, least propellant used, or somewhere between those extremes will affect the optimum exhaust velocity to use.

Once a design has been set for a vehicle, there is additional optimization possible within a particular mission.  The design and mission fix the quantities of propellant mass and mission &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;.  If the engine type allows variable exhaust velocity, it takes less total energy to &quot;dump&quot; the early exhaust mass at a lower exhaust velocity &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt;, and then eject the later mass with a higher &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt;, than to eject at a constant &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt;.  If the goal is minimum time and you have a fixed energy source, this will be the optimum operating profile.  

For missions which use solar power as a source, the optimal operation is more complex.  First, solar flux varies as the inverse square of distance from the Sun.  Second, solar powered orbit changes around a large body introduces shadowing and a stronger gravity field, which takes longer to traverse.  For low thrust engines, short thrust intervals require less &lt;math&gt;\Delta V&lt;/math&gt; by up to a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, but close orbits are in shadow up to half the time and limit when you can generate thrust.  When the local gravity acceleration is low relative to the vehicle acceleration, which happens farther from the body, then short thrust intervals do not impose a large time penalty.  Deeper in a gravity well, they do.  Lastly, for bodies with radiation belts, like Earth and Jupiter, time spent climbing through those belts can damage solar arrays, other hardware, and human passengers.  In complex cases like these, the best thrust plan is found using a numerical simulation which divides the mission into small time steps and adjusts the variables looking for the best result for whatever parameters the mission planner wants to optimize (time, fuel used, radiation exposure, or others).


'''Combined Energy Source:'''

Other propulsion methods listed above, such as combustion gas rockets, have propellants which provide both the mass flow and energy supply to generate an exhaust velocity, &lt;math&gt;V_e&lt;/math&gt;.  In these cases the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows that higher velocity is always better.  Combustion engines have been developed with extraordinary power/mass ratios, up to 2.7 MW/kg.  This enables them to lift not only themselves, but the entire vehicle's mass against the Earth's gravity.  This makes possible launch to orbit without external assistance.  Their performance is limited, however, by the available energy in the fuel, which in the case of Earth is about half that needed to reach orbit.  Atmospheric engines obtain much of the mass flow and energy from outside the vehicle, so they bypass the limits of a purely internal propellant.  This usually comes at the expense of increased mass from items like inlets, turbines, and wings.  This lowers the power/mass ratio, and of course only functions while you are still in the atmosphere.  The choice to use atmospheric engines will therefore depend on many factors beyond propellant energy.  Atmospheric engines can have as much as 10-20x lower fuel use for a given thrust, so that is a strong incentive despite the complications.

Comparing split vs combined energy sources, a separate energy source relieves the limits on energy per propellant mass used.  This allows higher exhaust velocities and lower propellant use, often by an order of magnitude or more.  The drawback is current technology for these methods usually generates much less than one Earth gravity, because energy sources like solar panels are below 200 W/kg, far below combustion engines.  This limits their use for the important job of getting from the ground to Earth orbit.  Once in orbit, their performance advantage will often make them the preferred option.  This is because the best chemical propellants contain about 15 MJ/kg of energy.  A 175 W/kg space solar panel (state of the art as of 2016) will produce that much energy in about a day.  Since the panel typically lasts 15 years, it will produce about 5000 times more total energy over its life.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''External Interaction'''&lt;/font&gt;==

The second major group of propulsive forces are applied by or against some external object or field, rather than expelling some material from the vehicle.  Since no reaction mass is consumed, the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation does not apply.  We list them roughly in order of performance, but in this group the measure is effective velocity change rather than exhaust velocity.


====I. Mechanical Traction (5 km/s)====

This method uses mechanical forces applied to a vehicle or payload from an external source.  Applications of this method include:

* Using a cable or net to capture and decelerate the vehicle relative to a destination. 
* An elevator to climb a tower or cable at a constant velocity.  
* A tow cable between two vehicles or between a fixed installation and a vehicle, for acceleration or lift.
* A rotating structure or cable to provide radial or angular acceleration.

Mechanical devices transmit forces by atomic bonds in the materials used.  They are limited by the strength of the bonds, and so the bulk material strength, to around 3-5 km/s for existing materials.  The theoretical strength limits for carbon nanotubes (100 GPa tension, per Zhou, '''[http://user.physics.unc.edu/~zhou/muri/pubfiles/QZhao_PRB.ultimatestrength.pdf Ultimate Strength of Carbon Nanotubes]''', Phys. Rev. B, v 65 p144105, 2002) and diamond (90 GPa compression, per Telling '''[http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~cjp20/old/publications/PRL84_5160.pdf Theoretical Strength and Cleavage of Diamond]''' Phys. Rev. Lett. v84 n22 p5160, 2000), given a density of 3500 kg/m^3 and a design margin of 2.8, produce a theoretical velocity of around 12 km/s.  However, real materials accumulate defects, even if at an atomic scale.  So the usable strength in practice is much lower than the theoretical value.  A large advantage for mechanical systems is their inherent ability for repetitive use. This divides the initial cost by the number of uses over the economic life of the system.


====J. Friction (2 km/s)====

This method uses frictional forces against a solid surface to lower relative velocity.   If your intent is to slow down on, for example, the Moon, you can have a flat paved runway or a raised rail, and simply use mechanical braking against the runway or rail to stop.  To accelerate to orbit, you can grasp a trailing cable or rail on an orbiting platform and apply friction to gain velocity.  This method has the virtue of being simple.  Space velocities, however, often represent more kinetic energy than it takes to heat and melt materials.  So the friction forces must be distributed in time, rate, or total amount to prevent overheating.  It is therefore more useful for planets or satellites with low orbital velocities, and for small velocity changes as part of a larger total.


====K. Gas Pressure (6 km/s)====

This method uses external gas pressure differences to apply forces to a vehicle.  It includes all types of guns, where the gas is confined in a tube to accelerate linearly.  Gas expansion is limited by the temperature and molecular weight of the gas.  Hot Hydrogen then yields the best performance, which is limited to around 9 km/s in the best case, and about 6 km/s for practical designs.  There are a variety of methods to generate hot gases.  The oldest, conventional firearms, depend on fast combustion of a solid propellant grain.  Newer versions function via combustors , fuel-air detonation, particle bed heaters, or other methods to create heat and pressure in a short time.  When the hot gas so created is not sufficient, a two-stage method transfers the energy by means of a piston to a lighter gas (usually Hydrogen).  A properly tuned piston mass can result in higher temperatures and pressures in the light gas than in the first stage.

Various kinds of guns have been used for high velocity research since about the 1960's.  Most have been used indoors, but at least two have seen outdoor use.  They have not been used for space launch yet, but that is a matter of size and location, rather than technology level.  An extreme use of gas pressure is to use a fission or fusion device to heat a large amount of gas to plasma temperatures in a chamber, which then is applied to accelerate a vehicle.  This concept remains theoretical because of bans on testing and the tendency to destroy the chamber.


====L. Aerodynamic Forces (4 km/s)====

These forces include lift, buoyancy, and drag.  Wings and fan blades develop lift by pressure difference across the upper and lower surfaces when a fluid such as air flows across them.  At higher velocities, a '''[[w:WaveRider|WaveRider]]''' type inclined surface rides the lower shock wave it generates to create lift.  Buoyancy develops lift by having a lower density than the surrounding fluid, such as in a balloon.  Drag generates forces by accelerating the surrounding fluid in the direction you are moving, thus producing a force opposite your motion.  A parachute, for example, is shaped to capture and accelerate the maximum amount of air, producing the maximum amount of drag to slow you down.  Lifting forces invariably create drag, and tend to create more at higher velocities.  Heating also becomes a limiting factor at high velocity, tending to set a limit of about 4 km/s for aerodynamic forces, except for re-entry systems where the heating is efficiently dissipated.  Since aerodynamic forces in themselves always create friction and other dissipation, by themselves they can only slow a vehicle relative to the fluid.  They require a source of thrust, like a jet engine, to accelerate.


====M. Photon Reflection (185 km/s)====

Instead of an internal source, as in H. Photon Emission above, this method uses an external source of photons, such as a star or laser.  Normal (perpendicular) reflection produces a force of


:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{E(1+R)}{c}&lt;/math&gt;


where E is the incident energy on the reflector, R is the reflectivity (fraction of incident light reflected), and c is the speed of light.  This is nearly twice the force from emission, because the photon changes velocity by twice the speed of light from forward to backward.  It is slightly less than twice because no reflector is 100% efficient.  When the reflection is not perpendicular, the force is reduced by off-axis cosine losses.  The quantity of light (photons) is not limited by an internal power source, so can reach relatively higher forces than emission, but still generally low compared to other methods.  A solar or light sail uses thin but very large reflectors in order to intercept the maximum amount of light.  To get the highest accelerations, the maximum ratio of reflected energy to mass is desired.  Tungsten may be a dense element, but can operate at much higher temperature close to the Sun where the light intensity is higher.  Where maximum temperature is not required, a light alloy like Magnesium-Aluminum, with high reflectivity, is preferred.

Given a sufficiently powerful light source, quite high velocities are possible.  Using natural light sources such as the Sun we get approximately 8.2 microNewtons/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Earth's distance.  The gravitational force from the Sun on a lightweight sail may be 0.35 times this.  The '''Lightness Ratio''', LR, or ratio of light pressure to gravity then determines the maximum escape velocity by


:&lt;math&gt;V_{max} = (LR-1)V_e&lt;/math&gt;
 

where V(e) is the local escape velocity.  So paradoxically, to reach maximum final velocity you want to start as close to the Sun as possible, where local escape velocity is higher.    For a lightweight sail, this might be 0.2 AU, limited by the melting point, and an escape velocity of 100 km/s.  Thus the maximum final velocity is 185 km/s.  Any velocity less than this maximum is possible.  The practical limits using artificial light sources such as a laser are unknown, since no lasers with high enough sustained power to be useful for this purpose exist.  In theory a powerful enough laser can accelerate a sail to substantial fractions of the speed of light, before accounting for drag from the interstellar medium.

By tilting a sail from perpendicular to the light source, off-axis forces can be generated.  The net force will be approximately perpendicular to the sail and allow inward spiral orbits by directing the force against the orbital velocity, or tilting of the orbit plane by directing the reflection perpendicular to velocity.  Sub-orbital or zero velocity motion can be produced by balancing light pressure against local gravity.  These are not orbits because they depend on constant forces.  Rather they fall into the class of powered trajectories.


====N. Particle Deflection (100 km/s)====

The thin plasma and gas emitted by the Sun's heated outer layers is called the '''[[w:Solar_wind|Solar wind]]'''.  The wind has typical velocities of 400-750 km/s relative to the Sun, and extends outwards to about 125 AU, where it encounters the interstellar medium.  The force per area due to light pressure is much greater than that due to solar wind flux.   A '''[[w:Magnetic_sail|Magnetic Sail]]''' is a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion.  It would use a magnetic field to deflect charged particles in the plasma wind.  Since the field itself is non-material, in theory it can be large enough to get useful thrust, even though the area density of the solar wind is very low.  By tilting the field, a sideways force can be generated.  This method is limited to the velocity of the wind, and generally to producing forces away from the Sun.  An artificial beam of particles could also, in theory, be used to apply a force to a vehicle, which either absorbs or deflects the beam.  This remains theoretical because powerful enough beams are not available, and keeping them focused over typical distances in space is difficult.


====O. Magnetic Field (20 km/s)====

This method generates a force by using a current carrying wire, coil, or magnet to react against other magnetic fields (natural or man-made).  In this category fall magnetic levitation or '''[[w:Maglev|Maglev]]'''; '''[[w:Coilgun|Coilguns]]''', which use a series of timed coils; '''[[w:Railgun|Railguns]]''', which use two high current rails and a plasma short across them; and '''[[w:Electrodynamic_tether|Electrodynamic Propulsion]]''', which reacts against a natural magnetic field.  It can be used both for net thrust and drag, or for torque forces to rotate a vehicle.  Magnetic flywheels are often used to orient or rotate spacecraft.  The Sun and some planets have a natural magnetic field to react against.  Many artificial satellites also use the magnetic field to rotate the satellite to a desired orientation using a '''[[w:Magnetorquer|Magnetorquer]]'''.  For example, see Galysh et al, '''[http://www.stensat.org/Publications/SPIE.PDF CubeSat: Developing a Standard Bus for Picosatellites]'''.  In theory there is no limit to the velocity you can reach using magnetic fields.  In practice, the natural fields such as the strong one around Jupiter, or the practical scale or field strength of an artificial accelerator, limit velocity changes to around 20 km/s.


====P. Gravity Field (20 km/s)====

Gravity forces accelerate objects towards any nearby mass.  Normally this results in an orbit or simply falling towards an object.  A '''[[w:Gravity_assist|Gravity Assist]]''' is purposely choosing a hyperbolic path to change the direction, but not the total amount, of your velocity relative to a given object.  The maximum change is twice the escape velocity of the object, when the direction is changed 180 degrees.  To reach a desired mission destination, usually much less than this can be done.  Since a planet, for example, is moving with respect to the Sun, changing direction relative to the planet can change the total velocity relative to the Sun.  By conservation of momentum, the planet also must change velocity, but since it is much more massive, the velocity change is small enough to ignore in most cases.  Within the Solar System, the achievable velocity changes are about 20 km/s, and may need multiple gravity assists to reach this level.  The major advantage of gravity assist is it does not need internal propulsion except to line up the flyby, and therefore saves propellant mass.  A disadvantage is one or more gravity assists take extra time to complete, and restrict the choice of trajectories because you can't choose where the moon or planet you are using will be at a given time.

Gravity fields extend to infinity, so every place in the Universe has a field, and almost everywhere has a non-zero net field.  So all space transport has to account for gravity forces in mission planning.  Usually it is an obstacle to overcome, in reaching orbit or changing orbits, but in some cases, such as gravity assist, it can be used to advantage.  Gravity changes as the inverse square of distance from an object.  If your vehicle or object is elongated, the '''[[w:Gravity_gradiometry|Gravity Gradient]]''', or difference in gravity between the lower and upper ends, can also be used as a torque to stabilize your orientation.  These gravity gradients exist whether or not you use them, so they must also be taken into account as a force to be overcome in system design.


===&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%;line-height:2em;&quot;&gt;'''Discussion'''&lt;/span&gt;===
&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=Garamond&gt;

Compared to the expelled mass group, external interactions do not consume a finite supply of reaction mass.  So these methods would be preferred, all other factors being equal.  Reaction mass, though, can be expelled under a wider range of circumstances in most cases, and usually with a higher thrust/mass ratio.  So it is not possible to state a general conclusion as to which approach is better.  The choice would depend on a variety of detailed circumstances, including destination, trajectory, desired trip time, cargo mass, frequency of trips, and how far in the future the transport occurs.  The latter affects what technologies are available and how ready for use they are.  One approach to selection is to look at the external interaction group first, to see if any can be applied to the job at hand, then look at the group that uses up reaction mass second, since that requires overhead above whatever cargo you are trying to deliver.

==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Energy in General'''&lt;/font&gt;==

All of civilization requires energy to function, including about 8 MJ/day (~2000 Calories) of food energy per person.  Space systems are no exception,  They require energy both for propulsion and for other systems like life support, computers, and materials processing.  The general field of energy is vast, involving many fields of engineering.  Energy for space projects involves an equally wide range.  So we can only provide an introduction, and supply references for further study.  In this section we survey the range of possible energy sources for all types of space systems.  Since the book is oriented to future space projects, we list a number of sources that are not developed yet, but are possible according to known physics.  These sources can then be used for the propulsion methods tabulated in Part 2, and for other engineering purposes described in Part 3 and later.  By making a two dimensional table of energy sources vs propulsive forces, we can categorize all possible propulsion methods, and we do this at the start of Part 2 of the book.  We have not yet developed a similar table to neatly categorize the other systems in a space project.


'''Proximate vs Ultimate Energy'''

The principle of '''[[w:Conservation_of_energy|Conservation of Energy]]''' states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, merely transformed from one kind to another.  So all energy for a project must come from a preexisting source.  For a given project you can distinguish a '''proximate''' energy source, which is in the form consumed by the project, and an '''ultimate''' energy source, which traces the proximate source back through previous transformations to it's original form.  Ultimately, all energy traces back to the creation of the Universe, but for engineering purposes we rarely go back that far, and are generally concerned with proximate sources.

For current space systems the energy is typically stored internally as chemical energy in the case of launch vehicles, or uses sunlight in the case of satellites.  In the future, energy needs are likely to change, and the sources of energy will also change.  Permanent locations, such as a large orbiting habitat or surface base, generally need continuous sources of energy to operate.  Devices like batteries become unwieldy at that scale to supply power for the night part of Earth orbit or the two week Lunar night.  Future projects may also need much greater power levels for tasks like processing of local materials.  So the following headings attempt to include all potential energy sources, including many not yet used, but which may become useful in the future space projects.  We list them all so that designers know the full range of possibilities, from which they can then select viable options for a given task.  We exclude sources such as human and animal power from consideration here, both due to their low power levels, and because living things are not subject to the same kind of engineering design as we apply to non-living system.  We also exclude sources like wind and geothermal, which mostly apply to Earth.  Last, we includes some energy storage methods, which are not strictly sources.  Energy storage, however, is often a necessary and important part of system design.    


'''Energy References'''

A starting point for understanding energy sources in general, not just as they apply to space projects, is a National Academies book '''[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12091 America's Energy Future]''', 2009.  About 150 other books are available for free download in the '''[http://www.nap.edu/topics.php?topic=283&amp;t=p Energy and Conservation]''' topic from the same site.  Encyclopedic references on the topic of energy, include the '''[http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Energy-Series/dp/012176480X Encyclopedia of Energy], [http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Energy-Engineering-Technology-Version/dp/0849336538 Encyclopedia of Energy Engineering and Technology],''' and the '''[http://www.amazon.com/Macmillan-Encyclopedia-Energy-Volume-Set/dp/0028650212 Macmillan Encyclopedia of Energy]'''.  These are often expensive reference books, so library or other sources are recommended to get access.  There are numerous engineering books on more specific aspects of energy systems.  Wikipedia also has an '''[[w:Outline_of_energy|Outline of Energy article]]''', with many links.  Some of the concepts listed below are currently theoretical, so they are not well covered in reference books about current energy use or engineering.  Information about them will mostly be found in research reports and scientific/technical papers.
  

==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Mechanical Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

'''[[w:Mechanical_energy|Mechanical Energy]]''' includes energy stored by virtue of previous work, as in compressed gases, and that which exists by virtue of position (potential) and motion (kinetic).  Objects in orbital motion have a combination of potential and kinetic energy.


====A. Compressed Gas====

Although '''[[w:Pressure_vessel|Pressure vessels]]''' are strictly an energy storage method, for space missions the tanks are normally pre-filled.  So they operate as a proximate energy source in flight.  The available energy, W, stored in a pressurized tank, can be found from


:&lt;math&gt;W = p_B v_B \ln \frac{p_A}{p_B}&lt;/math&gt;


where B represents the high pressure and A represents the low pressure, and p and v are pressure and volume respectively.  So a 1 cubic meter tank with a high pressure of 20 MPa and a low pressure of 10 Mpa would provide 13.8 MJ of available energy.  Compressed gas is a low density energy storage method.  It is often used in space vehicles for tasks like cold gas thrusters and pressurizing liquid fuel tanks.  Its chief advantages are simplicity, requiring just a storage tank and a valve, and rapid release of the stored energy.  When larger total amounts of energy are needed, a higher density but more complex system is often preferred.


====B. Potential Energy====

'''[[w:Potential_energy|Potential Energy]]''' is the ability of a system to do work by virtue of it's position or configuration.  In space projects this is usually position relative to the gravity well of a massive object such as a planet.  A simple hypothetical example is a stationary space elevator cable.  While raising a cargo, electricity is converted to potential energy of height.  When lowering a cargo, the potential energy can be extracted back to electricity. The formula for potential energy U was given in '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Physics|Section 1.1 - Physics]]''' as


:&lt;math&gt;U = -G \frac{m_1 M_2}{r} &lt;/math&gt;


The difference in energy at two radii gives the amount of potential energy stored or released over the distance.  For small changes in radius (height) relative to the distance r, the potential difference can be approximated by the average gravitational force (weight) times height.  On planetary surfaces, large amounts of available mass can be used to store potential energy.  On Earth this is done with dams for hydroelectric power.  On other bodies, a mountain and a pile of rocks can serve the same purpose.  Transporting the rocks up and down the mountain can serve to store or release energy.
 

====C. Kinetic Energy====

'''[[w:Kinetic_energy|Kinetic Energy]]''' is that which an object possesses by virtue of it's motion.  Its formula was given in '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Physics|Section 1.1 - Physics]]''' as


:&lt;math&gt;KE = \tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 = Fd&lt;/math&gt;


where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the object's mass, and v is the velocity.  It is also equal to an accelerating force ''F'' times the distance ''d'' it is applied over.  An object in orbit has both kinetic energy in it's orbital velocity and potential energy in it's altitude.  In an elliptical orbit, it continuously exchanges altitude for velocity.  So it also exchanges potential and kinetic energy, but the combined total stays the same. 

Rotating objects such as a space station or reaction flywheel have a form of kinetic energy in it's motion around an axis. Rotational energy is E(k) calculated by


:&lt;math&gt;E_k=\frac{1}{2} I \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the '''[[w:angular velocity|Angular Velocity]]''' in units of radians/second, and  &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt; is the '''[[w:moment of inertia|Moment of Inertia]]''' of the mass about the center of rotation.  The moment of inertia is the measure of resistance to '''[[w:torque|Torque]]''', or rotational force, applied on a spinning object. The higher the moment of inertia, the slower it will spin when a given force is applied. Moment of inertia depends on the distribution of mass in the rotating object.  The farther out a given portion of the mass is, the larger the contribution.  Formulas for many shapes are found in the '''[[w:List of moments of inertia|List of Moments of Inertia]]'''.  For complex shapes, the total moment can be found by dividing it into simpler parts and summing the individual moments. 

Some examples of moment of inertia formulas are:

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{1}{2} mr^2&lt;/math&gt; for a solid cylinder,


:&lt;math&gt;I = m r^2&lt;/math&gt; for a thin-walled empty cylinder, and


:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{1}{2} m({r_{external}}^2 + {r_{internal}}^2)&lt;/math&gt; for a thick-walled empty cylinder


Kinetic energy can be exchanged for other forms of energy by gravitational forces, as in gravity assist maneuvers; or electromagnetic forces, as in many electromechanical devices.  Potential energy can also be exchanged for kinetic energy via the '''[[w:Oberth effect|Oberth effect]]''' by expending propellant deep in a gravity well.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Chemical Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

Chemical sources are an arrangement of atoms in a higher energy state which are converted to a lower energy state by a '''[[w:Chemical_reaction|Chemical Reaction]]''', releasing the difference.  Combustion is the most common way to release this energy, accounting for over 80% of total human energy use.  Batteries are characterized by a reversible reaction, so that the same device can store and release energy multiple times.


====D. Fuel-Atmosphere Combustion====

The Earth's atmosphere, neglecting the variable amounts of water vapor, contains 20.95% Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecules, which react with many other compounds to release energy.  This Oxygen is the byproduct of '''[[w:Photosynthesis|Photosynthesis]]''' in living things.  In the case of aircraft, a hydrocarbon fuel such as '''[[w:Kerosene|Kerosene]]''' is reacted with the atmospheric Oxygen in an engine.  Since only the fuel is carried internally to the vehicle, the energy released, about 43 MJ/kg, is about three times as much as when both ingredients are carried internally, such as in a typical rocket.  Large amounts of Oxygen in an atmosphere is unstable, because it is so chemically reactive.  It only exists on Earth in this form because plants constantly produce it.  So this energy source is not available on other bodies.  The reverse option is available on a body such as Titan, which has a hydrocarbon atmosphere.  In that case, Oxygen can be the carried ingredient, and burned with the surrounding atmosphere.  For atmospheres which are mostly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Venus and Mars), which is an end product of combustion, or bodies with no atmosphere at all, this energy source is not available.


====E. Fuel-Oxidizer Combustion====

The energy source in conventional rockets is '''[[w:Combustion|Combustion]]''', where both the fuel and oxidizer are supplied from internal sources.  The ingredients with the highest reaction energy, Hydrogen and Oxygen, provide 15 MJ/kg of propellant.  Although lower in '''[[w:Specific_energy|Specific Energy]]''' than D. Fuel-Atmosphere Combustion, it is not restricted to operating in the Earth's atmosphere.  Liquid rocket engines also have extraordinary power-to-mass ratios.  This enables launch trajectories from large bodies like planets.  Combustion can also be used as a secondary power source in '''[[w:Auxiliary_power_unit|Auxiliary Power Units]]'''.  Because the rate of energy release is very high, combustion is useful when high power levels are needed.  The efficiency of combustion engines is typically 1/3 to 2/3, so other options may be preferred when that is an important factor.


====F. Chemical Battery====

An '''[[w:Battery_(electricity)|Electric Battery]]''' is a device which converts stored chemical energy to electricity, and in a storage battery also reverses the reaction.  Common examples of chemical batteries include the '''[[w:Lead–acid_battery|Lead-Acid]]''' type used in automobiles, and the '''[[w:Lithium-ion_battery|Lithium-Ion]]''' type used in many portable devices. Depending on battery type, they generally store less then 1 MJ/kg, considerably less than combustion.  The ability to cycle energy in and out multiple times can outweigh the lower energy density.  An example is the International Space Station, where large batteries supply power in the shadowed part of its orbit.  

A '''[[w:Fuel_cell|Fuel Cell]]''' is a type of battery where the reactants are stored in external tanks, rather than in a sealed battery case.  It can have high specific energy because the tanks are lightweight compared to electrolyte solutions.  Fuel cells have therefore been used in space projects, such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter.  A Hydrogen-Oxygen fuel cell combined with an '''[[w:Electrolysis|Electrolysis]]''' unit to convert the resulting water back to Hydrogen and Oxygen can supply energy storage with a specific in the range of 3-10 MJ/kg.  Sealed batteries are simple and reliable, and can be made in very small sizes.  Fuel cells have higher specific energies, but are more complicated devices, since they need valves and a way to pump and store the various chemicals. 


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Thermal Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

'''[[w:Thermal_energy|Thermal Energy]]''' is the internal energy of a system due to its temperature.  It comes from the kinetic and vibration energies, and the attractive potentials of the molecules or other particles making up the system.  Thermal energy can be stored for later use, or added from an outside energy source for immediate use.  We sense high temperatures as heat, and even higher temperatures as visible light.  Energy naturally flows from higher to lower temperature areas by conduction, radiation, and convection.  When a temperature difference exists, some of the thermal energy can be converted to other forms and used.  An example is a steam turbine that generates electricity from the difference between hot steam and the cooled outlet.


====G. Thermal Storage Bed====

For locations like the Lunar surface, which has a long night, solar power is not effective half the time.  So storing heat in a '''[[w:Thermal_energy_storage|Thermal Energy Storage]]''' system may be a viable option.  Heat is put into rocks during the daytime and extracted from them at night to run a generator.  The rock bed is enclosed in a container, and gas transfers heat to a turbine for generation, and from a solar collector for storage.  Since the rock can be obtained locally, the energy stored per mass of installed equipment is fairly high.  Environment temperatures during the Lunar night are quite low, and this can be enhanced by thermal shields between a radiator and the ground and daytime Sun.  So the temperature difference between the storage and rejection temperature, and therefore efficiency, can be fairly high.

Some bodies, like Earth and Jupiter's moon '''[[w:Io_(moon)|Io]]''', have relatively high interior temperatures.  They serve as a natural thermal storage bed by the low thermal conductivity of surface rock.  The source of heat can be radioactive decay or tides.  This energy can be put to use by drilling down to high temperature regions, and exploiting the difference between those and surface temperatures.


====H. Concentrated Light====

A number of industrial tasks require heating, which is easily done in space by concentrating sunlight.  Examples are heating of raw materials to extract volatiles, or maintaining temperature and growing ability in a Mars greenhouse.  The concentration ratio determines the maximum '''[[w:Black_body|Black Body]]''' temperature that can be reached, up to the temperature of the light source.  In the case of the Sun, the upper limit is the Sun's surface temperature, 5,775 K, less reflection losses and radiation losses from the object you are heating.  Since Tantalum-Hafnium-Carbide, the highest melting point substance known, melts at 4200 K, concentrated sunlight should be sufficient for most industrial processes.

For space transport, a reaction mass can also be heated by concentrated solar or artificial light.  Lighter molecules can be used than the exhaust products of chemical reactions, so higher performance can be reached.  Lack of powerful enough lasers limits their use for propulsion at present, but sunlight is widely available in space.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Electrical Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

'''[[w:Electricity|Electricity]]''' is the set of phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge.  Common examples are '''[[w:Electric_current|Electric Current]]''', in the form of electrons moving in a conducting wire, and '''[[w:Lightning|Lightning]]''', a powerful electrostatic discharge through a plasma channel in a storm.  Electricity is a very versatile energy source because it can be converted to other forms efficiently, controlled in both tiny and large amounts, and moved about from place to place relatively easily.  There are a number of ways to produce and distribute electrical energy.


====I. Power Line====

Most space projects use electrical energy in some form.  The parts of a project on Earth are often by far the largest.  These include factories to produce the vehicles and spacecraft, launch sites, and control centers.  Typically they get their electricity from a network of '''[[w:Electric_power_transmission|Electric Power Transmission]]''' and '''[[w:Electric_power_distribution|Distribution]]''' lines.  This is distributed to the point of use by local '''[[w:Electrical_wiring|Electrical Wiring]]'''.  What distinguishes these three is the scale of power, P, in Joules/second, or '''Watts''', and the voltage and distance the power is moved.  Most wires have electrical '''[[w:Electrical_resistance_and_conductance|Resistance]]''', R, which is a measure of the difficulty in carrying a current, I, using a voltage V.  They are related by the formulas


:&lt;math&gt; V = IR \qquad and \qquad P = VI &lt;/math&gt; 


The resistance causes some of the energy to be converted to heat.  The amount of power converted, P, is found by 


:&lt;math&gt;P = I^2R&lt;/math&gt;


When efficient delivery of energy, and not heating, is the intended purpose, you want to minimize the resistance heating.  Since resistance is a material property, by this formula you want to use a low current, I.  By the previous formula, the useful power P = VI, so a low current implies a high voltage.  Therefore long distance lines are operated at higher voltages, and voltage changes are provided by '''[[w:Transformer|Transformers]]''' as needed.

The same principles will apply to the space portion of a project when the distance between the point of generation and the point of use is large.  Additionally, mass is usually a factor for space systems.  So besides minimizing losses from resistance and transformer efficiency, you want to minimize the mass of the wires.  The International Space Station is an example where generation and use are separated by an average of about 50 meters.  This is because the Station is intended as a zero gravity laboratory, but the solar arrays need to rotate to follow the Sun.  Since they are quite large, they are placed to the sides with rotating joints.This option mostly applies to fixed locations rather than vehicles.  This is not a large enough distance to require high voltage lines for efficiency.  Examples of future projects with longer power lines include mining water ice in shadowed craters at the Lunar poles.  Solar arrays at the crater rim may have continuous sunlight while the mining area has none.  So a transmission line can bridge the gap.  Another example is a nuclear power source for nighttime power for a Mars Base.  In that case the source is separated from the rest of the base for safety.  Finally, large orbital habitats and industrial plants may use centralized generators that are lighter and more efficient, and need long power lines due to the size of the facility.

All types of wires need isolation from other system elements and each other, to prevent power leakage, shorts, arcing, and for safety.  In a vacuum or non-conducting atmosphere, which the Earth's mostly is, isolation can be provided by mechanical gaps and spacing of wires.  When the wires must be spaced close together, an '''[[w:Insulator_(electricity)|Electrical Insulator]]''' can provide isolation, and combinations of spacing and insulation can also be used. 


====J. Electric Generator====

An '''[[w:Electric_generator|Electric Generator]]''' converts mechanical energy to electric energy.  The two general types are a '''[[w:Dynamo|Dynamo]]''' which produces direct current, where electrons flow in one direction; and an '''[[w:Alternator|Alternator]]''' which produces alternating current, where electrons flow in both directions in an alternating cycle.  Most of the Earth's electric power is produced by large alternators.  The mechanical energy enters the device via a rotating shaft, and an arrangement of magnetic fields induces a current in coils of wire.  The mechanical energy can come from any of a number of sources.  On Earth it is usually from high pressure steam or falling water acting on a turbine whose shaft is connected to the generator.  In the case of steam, it is created by burning fossil fuels or a nuclear reactor, and more recently, from concentrated sunlight.  A growing number of  '''[[w:Wind_turbine|Wind Turbines]]''' are being used to produce electricity.  The wind rotates aerodynamic blades mounted on a central shaft, and the shaft is connected to a generator.


====K. Magnetic Storage====

Some space projects, such as electromagnetic launch from Earth, require very high electric power levels for short periods of time.  These power levels can exceed what is available from the power grid.  Magnetic storage accumulates energy over a longer period of time, then releases it quickly when needed.  It uses a '''[[w:Superconducting_magnetic_energy_storage|Superconducting]]'' or high inductance/low resistance coil to store energy in a magnetic field.  Superconductors eliminate resistance heating losses, but require cryogenic refrigeration to maintain the superconducting state.  A large coil, cooled to lower resistance but not cryogenic, may be sufficient for some purposes.  The energy, E (in Joules) stored in a magnetic field can be found from


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {1}{2} L I^2&lt;/math&gt;


L is inductance in Henries, and I is current in Amperes.  Storing energy in this way causes structural loads from the field back to the coil, so the total storage amount is limited by the strength of the structure.  Some uses in space, like pulsed plasma propulsion systems, can benefit from smaller magnetic storage units to produce high power pulses from a lower power steady source.


====L. Semiconductors====

[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|right|800 px|Figure 1.4-1 - Best research cell efficiency since 1975]]

'''[[w:Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic]]''' cells convert light, usually from the Sun, into direct current electricity using semiconductor materials.  This technology is rapidly developing and has multiple materials and techniques (Figure 1.4-1).  Conversion efficiency from sunlight of the best research cells, using multiple layers to capture different wavelengths, has reached 46.0% as of 2015.  Production panels for use in space, made of multiple cells each, are near 30% efficiency, and the more common but less expensive single layer panels on Earth are typically 20% or less.  Note that the efficiency on Earth vs in space are based on different solar intensity and spectra, because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some wavelengths.

'''[[w:Thermophotovoltaic|Thermophotovoltaic]]''' devices convert infrared and visible light from any hot object into electricity.  They use similar semiconductors as photovoltaic cells, but optimized for the lower temperature source.  A '''[[w:Thermoelectric_generator|Thermoelectric Generator]]''' uses semiconductors to convert a temperature difference into electricity.  The most common use in space is generating power from radioisotope decay, in locations where solar panels are cumbersome, is not available all the time, or is too dim, such as beyond Jupiter.  An isotope like Plutonium-238 produces decay heat on a steady basis, which thermoelectric cells convert to electricity.  For space applications, pure efficiency is not the only significant measure.  Variation with temperature, radiation exposure, and the specific power (W/kg) are also important.  Given the trend of past improvements, it is expected semiconductor devices will continue to improve, at least in the short term.  The latest data should be checked for current performance.

====M. Solar-Driven Turbine/Generator====

In space, most electrical power so far comes from photovoltaics, since solar panels are lightweight and simple for small to medium amounts of power.  For large scale power, '''[[w:Brayton_cycle|Brayton Cycle]]''' turbines have been proposed, because of their potential high efficiency and low mass.  The turbine shaft then drives an electric generator.  The high and low temperatures for the cycle would be produced by solar concentrators and radiator panels.  '''[[w:Stirling_engine|Stirling]]''' type engines have also been proposed for space use.  Sunlight is abundant in space, and lightweight reflectors to concentrate it and feed a heat engine may be lower mass than photovoltaics.

====N. Rectenna Array====

A rectifying antenna, or '''[[w:Rectenna|Rectenna]]''' is an antenna that is used to convert electromagnetic energy into direct current electricity.  A single antenna element can be a '''[[w:Dipole_antenna|Dipole]]''', with a '''[[w:Diode|Diode]]''' connected across the dipole arms.  The incoming electromagnetic waves induce alternating currents in the dipole.  Since diodes conduct in only one direction, a direct current is passed on.  Many antenna elements are combined into an array to capture the whole of the incoming energy.  Rectennas have been proposed as the receiving element of a long distance microwave power transmission system, such as from Earth orbit to the ground.  Much more solar energy is available in space, which results in more net energy delivered on the ground, despite conversion losses.  The beam can also travel from the ground to orbit to deliver power to a satellite.

The length of a dipole antenna scales with the '''[[w:Wavelength|Wavelength]]''' of the incoming energy.  In principle, microscopic antenna arrays can be made by the same methods used for integrated circuits.  This would allow for the direct conversion of infrared or visible light.  Small scale antennas are in an early stage of research.  Their advantage for long-range transmission is in a smaller transmitter for a given distance.  Microwave technology, by comparison, is well developed, and high efficiency rectenna conversion has already been demonstrated.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Beam Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

'''[[w:Entropy|Entropy]]''' is a measure of disorder in a system.  A directional beam of energy has low entropy because the waves are highly ordered (parallel).  Useful work can be extracted from a low entropy system.  This results in increased entropy (disorder), typically as random motion of atoms in thermal equilibrium and random thermal emission.  Beams can be natural or artificial, and consist of electromagnetic waves or particles.  Energy beams can be used for various kinds of '''[[w:Beam-powered_propulsion|Beamed power propulsion]]''', or for powering more stationary activities.


====O. Sunlight====

At increasing distances from the '''[[w:Sun|Sun]]''', around 14 million km or more, sunlight becomes highly directional.  The source, which is 1.392 million km in diameter, then fills a small angular part of the sky.  At the Earth's distance it appears 0.5 degrees in width.  The small angle allows directional reflection as a controlled propulsion method.  It also allows for concentration by lenses or mirrors, to generate high temperatures for industrial or propulsion purposes.  This source includes direct use of sunlight, while the items under electrical sources are for sunlight converted to electricity.

The center of the Sun is at about 15.7 million degrees K, and has a core density of about 160,000 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Under these conditions Hydrogen undergoes '''[[w:Nuclear_fusion|Nuclear Fusion]]''' to Helium, releasing 3.846 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; Watts of energy.  This energy works its way from the core to the surface, where the temperature has fallen to 5,780K.  At this point the intensity is 63.1 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  At greater distances the same energy flow is spread over larger spherical surfaces, reaching 1362 W/m^2 at the Earth.    

At a distance of more than 550 AU, the Sun acts as a '''[[w:Gravitational_lens|Gravitational Lens]]''', bringing the light of other stars to a focus.  Light which passes farther from the Sun's edge is bent less, and comes to a focus farther away.  This creates a radial focal line of concentrated light from every other star or light source in the sky.  The same process happens around every other star that has visible neighboring stars.  These '''Star Lines''' may be intense enough to be useful, since they concentrate light from the whole circumference of a star to a point.


====P. Laser====

A '''[[w:Laser|Laser]]''' emits light through a process of optical amplification by stimulated emission.  The output of a laser is coherent and collimated, allowing it to be tightly focused, or travel long distances without spreading out.  The output can also be in a very narrow range of wavelengths.  Because of the narrow wavelength, it can be coupled efficiently to an absorber, or a high reflectivity reflector for that specific wavelength.  It can also be coupled to a photovoltaic device with high efficiency.  As an energy source for propulsion it can supply higher intensity light than natural sources like stars.  High power lasers have been proposed for launch from Earth, but sufficiently high power ones to make that use practical do not yet exist.  Lower power lasers can augment natural sunlight falling on spacecraft solar arrays.  Very high power lasers focused by the Sun's gravity have been suggested to power interstellar vehicles, but that use would far in the future.  


====Q. Microwave====

This energy source involves direct use of the microwave beam, while item N. Rectenna Array converts it to electricity.  A microwave beam can be absorbed and converted directly to heat, or it can be used to create photon pressure.  Any suitable wavelength can be used to create a directional energy beam.  However some wavelengths are absorbed by the Earth's or other atmospheres.  Shorter wavelengths can be focused more easily, since that depends on the ratio of antenna size to wavelength.  The efficiency of producing shorter wavelengths is typically lower, and generators with high enough power to be useful may not be available.  Microwave band equipment is developed enough to not suffer from these limitations.


====R. Neutral Particles====

A '''[[w:Particle-beam_weapon|Particle Beam]]''' is a collimated stream of high energy particles to deliver energy from one place to another.  The concept was originally developed as a weapon, but less lethal amounts of energy can be used as a power source.  Charged particles, such as protons in a '''[[w:Particle_accelerator|Particle Accelerator]]''' repel each other, so a beam would spread out once it leaves the confinement of the accelerator.  To prevent this, the charged particles are allowed to combine with electrons to form neutral atoms, or neutral particles like Neutrons are used.  Particle beams are in an early state of development, and mostly for military use, rather than energy delivery.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Nuclear Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

Nuclear energy sources involve a change in one or more types of '''[[w:Atomic_nucleus|Atomic Nucleii]]''', with the release of net energy.  The protons and neutrons in a nucleus are bound together by the strong nuclear force.  A change in their arrangement involves typically a million times as much energy than rearranging electrons, which is what chemical reactions do.  So nuclear energy sources are potentially very powerful.  Although the Sun operates by nuclear fusion, we consider it a source of light energy.  The fusion happens in the Sun's core, where it is not accessible, and what reaches us is blackbody radiation from the surface.


====S. Radioactive decay====

'''[[w:Radioactive_decay|Radioactive Decay]]''' is the spontaneous change of unstable atomic nucleii by the emission of particles or electromagnetic energy.  Unstable natural elements were created before the formation of the Solar System, most likely in supernova explosions.  The less unstable ones, such as Uranium and Thorium, still survive after billions of years, and continue to decay at a steady rate.  Artificial radioactive materials, such as Plutonium-238, are created in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators.  They are more unstable, and thus decay faster (an 88 year half-life in the case of Pu-238).  This element produces 500 Watts/kg of heat, when fresh, through radioactive decay, making it a useful energy source.  It has been used for this purpose on a number of planetary exploration missions.  Other elements with very long decay times in their natural state are too weak to use as energy sources.

[[File:Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg|thumb|right|671x441px|Figure 1.4-2 - Binding energy per nucleon for common isotopes, in MeV.]]

====T. Nuclear Fission====

The low natural decay rate of some elements can be increased by artificial means.  A '''[[w:Nuclear_reactor|Nuclear Reactor]]''' is a device for doing this in a controlled way for the production of energy.  The two main ways to do this are '''[[w:Nuclear_fission|Nuclear Fission]]''', the splitting of heavy nucleii into smaller parts, and '''[[w:Nuclear_fusion|Nuclear Fusion]]''', the merger of lighter nucleii to form a heavier one.  The reason for the two types can be found in the '''[[w:Nuclear_binding_energy|Binding Energy]]''' per nuclear particle in a nucleus (Figure 1.4-2).  A higher binding energy means the particles are more strongly held together and more stable, so energy can be released in forming that nucleus.  The binding energy has a peak at Iron-56, so reactions from either the light end (fusion) or heavy end (fission) towards the middle both produce energy.  Fission reactors are a significant source of electrical power on Earth.  In space, a few small-scale reactors have been used, and work is in progress on developing larger scale versions with higher power demands.

====U. Artificial Nuclear Fusion====

Natural fusion occurs in stars, and the resulting light output has been addressed above under beamed power sources.  This item is for artificial energy sources.  Fusion has been achieved momentarily in nuclear bombs, but steady state operation has proved difficult.  The most researched approach uses Tokamaks, which are doughnut shaped magnetic fields which contain a hot plasma.  This approach has not yet produced a working device, although various research machines have been built or are under construction.  A Tokamak type power reactor would be too massive for a reasonable propulsion system.  For stationary projects it would be as reasonable on another planet as on Earth.  A number of alternate intermittent and steady state fusion devices are under varying levels of research, but all at much lower funding than the work invested in the Tokamak type devices.  Some of those might yield a lightweight enough device for propulsion.

All fusion reactions combine light atomic nuclei into heavier ones.  As shown in Figure 1.4-2, the largest energy release is in the first few elements, from Hydrogen to Boron.  What is required to achieve fusion is to bring the positively charged nuclei close enough together against their electric repulsion for the nuclear forces to take over.  This requires the equivalent of millions of degrees K, or particle kinetic energy in the tens of kilo electron Volts (keV).

====V. Muon-Catalyzed Fusion====

'''[[w:Muon-catalyzed_fusion|Muon-Catalyzed Fusion]]''' is a method of catalyzing fusion reactions at temperatures far below the millions of degrees K otherwise required.   A beam of muons is directed at a deuterium/tritium mixture, where they cause multiple fusion reactions.  This heats the gas, which can then drive a generator for electricity.  Although this method and more complicated systems based on it are sound from a physics standpoint, a practical system from an engineering point of view has not been developed yet.  It must be considered a possible future energy source at this time.


====W. Nuclear Explosions====

Unfortunately, explosive '''[[w:Nuclear_weapon|Nuclear Weapons]]''' are all too well developed.  Various concepts have been proposed to use their high energy output for space projects.  These include a nuclear-powered launch device, where the explosive heats gas in an underground chamber.  This then propels a projectile up a barrel.  Another idea is to detonate small nuclear explosions behind a space vehicle, directly pushing it with the blast wave.  These concepts are speculative at present, because there is no way to safely test them on Earth, and treaties prohibit nuclear weapons in space.


==&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot; face=Garamond&gt;'''Matter Conversion Sources'''&lt;/font&gt;==

In physics, '''[[w:Mass–energy_equivalence|Mass-Energy Equivalence]]''' is the idea that mass is related to energy by the formula E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Since the speed of light, c, is a large number - 299.8 million m/s, the square is very large: 8.9875 x 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Joules/kg.  This is equal to the output of a nuclear power plant for 2.85 years for each kg of mass converted to energy.  In theory, total matter conversion provides the highest amount of energy per unit mass.  In practice, however, this is not so easy.


====X. Antimatter====

'''[[w:Antimatter|Antimatter]]''' is composed of antiparticles, which have the same mass as normal particles, but opposite charge and other properties.  When a particle and anti-particle meet, they destroy each other and are converted to other particles or photons, releasing large amounts of energy in the process.  Our universe is almost entirely made of matter.  So use of this material as an energy source requires making it artificially.  This requires at least as much energy as is later released by the annihilation.  Antimatter is therefore an extreme type of energy storage.  Antimatter is made in small amounts today in particle accelerators, and used for physics research.  We do not have practical ways to make and store it in large enough amounts for space projects.  Conceptually, a space vehicle would store some amount of antimatter, then use it to produce energy for propulsion.  If the storage system is light enough, the energy per mass would then be higher than nuclear fusion or other methods.

====Y. Black Hole====

A '''[[w:Black_hole|Black Hole]]''' is a region of '''[[w:Spacetime|Spacetime]]''' with such strong gravity that nothing can travel from inside to outside it.  Two forms of energy extraction are possible for black holes.  The first is infall energy, generated as material in an accretion disk around the black hole heats by friction and emits energy.  It is essentially converting potential energy into heat.  Since the gravitational potential of a black hole is extreme, this can release a lot of energy.  The second is '''[[w:Hawking_radiation|Hawking Radiation]]''' by quantum tunneling from hypothetical quantum black holes.  Black holes can form by the collapse of a large star at the end of it's life, or a sufficiently dense and massive region at the center of a galaxy.  Quantum black holes are smaller, and hypothesized to have formed during the creation of the Universe.  The nearest known stellar-mass black hole is 2800 light years from Earth, and quantum black holes have not been discovered, nor is there a known way to make them.  So use of black holes for space projects is theoretical at present.

{{TOC right}}

We begin our review of transport methods with the structures category. Human-made structures appear as early as 23,000 years ago &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/oldest-man-made-structure-found-in-greek-cave.html Theopetra Cave Wall Discovered]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the idea of building something to climb to the sky is ancient.  It is only recently, however, that modern structural materials have become strong enough to perform useful space transport functions, as well as their historical uses on Earth. Since a structure only needs to be built once, but can be used multiple times, it's relative cost goes down the more often it is used, and the longer the structural life is.  This is a very different economic situation than past rockets, which were only used once and then disposed of.

==Material Properties==
 
We want to know how useful a structural material is for space transport in and of itself, rather than as part of a vehicle with other propulsion. For that we derive measures from the material properties to compare to the job of leaving a given planet or body. These measure are relative to the body's gravity well or orbit velocity.
  
====Gravity Well====

Conceptually, the &quot;depth&quot; of a gravity well can be expressed as the surface gravity times the radius of the body, which has units of m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This may be thought of as climbing the radius of the body at the constant surface gravity is the same amount of work as climbing to infinity under the actual inverse square decrease of gravity with distance.  For Earth, that is 6,378,000 meters at 9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (standard surface gravity) or 62,547,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is derived from the formulas for potential energy and gravitational force in the Physics section.

(The formula is &lt;math&gt;-GMm/r&lt;/math&gt; where G is the Gravitational Constant, M is the mass of the large body, m is the mass of the object of interest, and r is the radius of the large body.  Since the gravitational force is &lt;math&gt;GMm/r^2&lt;/math&gt;, the potential can be expressed as minus the gravitational force times r.  Since generally &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;, dividing by the object mass gives the gravity well per mass as &lt;math&gt;-ar&lt;/math&gt;, where a is the surface gravity and r is the radius.  This is a convenient form for calculations, since both surface gravity and radius are usually known.)

====Scale Length==== 

A vertical column or cable with a constant area has a mass 
:&lt;math&gt;m = DAh&lt;/math&gt; 
where D is the density in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, A is the cross sectional area in square meters, and h is the height in meters.  The compressive force at the bottom (for columns), or tensile force at the top (for cables) is found by the usual F = ma formula, where acceleration a in this case is the local one due to gravity. Dividing by the area A gives force per unit area, or pressure, P as
:&lt;math&gt;P = DAha/A = Dha&lt;/math&gt;
The tensile or compressive strength of a material, S, also has units of force per area.  Equating them and solving for h then gives the maximum height the material can sustain before failing as 
:&lt;math&gt;S = Dha&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;h(scale) = S/Da&lt;/math&gt;
This is called the '''scale length'''. For example, common steel has a strength of 275 MPa and a density of 7800 kg/m^3, and Earth surface gravity is 9.81 m/s^2, thus scale length is 3600 meters.  A very strong carbon fiber/epoxy composite column has a strength of 1300 Mpa and a density of 1650 kg/m^3 and thus a scale length of 80 km.  Since the Earth's radius and equivalent gravity well depth is 6378 km, the scale length/gravity well ratio for this material is 0.0125. 

Scale length is a theoretical value like the ultimate tensile strength at which materials fail.  Real designs will always use some value below that so the loads are well below the failure point. We define the  '''Working Length''' as the scale length divided by the '''Design Factor of Safety''' FS. This is a factor based on experience sufficient to reduce failure probabilities to an acceptable level for the given purpose. Where 1 represents the design stress, the Factor of Safety - 1 is the '''Margin of Safety''', the amount of strength above the expected loads to account for both known and unknown variables in loads and the actual strength of a structural element vs it's theoretical design strength. 

====Design Efficiency==== 

Constant area columns or cables are simple to design and calculate for small structures, but are not an efficient design for large ones. This is because the load is a maximum at only one end of a large structure - the bottom for a column and the top for a hanging cable.  A constant stress, rather than constant area, design makes the best use of the material by using all of it at it's safe stress limit. Therefore the cross sectional area must vary to suit the local loads. This results in minimum weight and cost, since you only use as much structure as you need at any point. 

In a column where the weight you are supporting is at the top, each part of the column below the top has to support that weight plus the part of the column above that point.  Therefore the column has to support an increasing load as you go down, and needs a larger area to keep the stress per area the same.  Similarly for a cable with a weight at the bottom, each point of the cable supports that weight, plus the cable below that point, so the cable are should increase as you go up. The amount of increase is 1/(working length) per meter, since the working length is how many meters the load increases by 100% of the allowed stress. The constant percentage increase in load per meter results in an exponential taper, by a factor of e (2.718...) per working length. In other words the area ratio AR is

:&lt;math&gt;AR = \frac{A(bottom)}{A(top)} = e^{H/(h(scale)/FS)} &lt;/math&gt;, where H is the total height.

Since in theory there is no limit on the area growth, you could build a structure of any height or length with any material.  In practice, the exponential growth in area from a real material leads to a practical limit due to mass or cost. This is especially true for large bodies like the Earth.  Where that limit falls depends on what the purpose of the structure is.

====Tip Velocity====

Where the design is a system in rotation about it's center of mass, rather than vertical in a gravity well, we still have a tapered design, but the loading force is centrifugal acceleration rather than gravity.  The formula for centrifugal acceleration at any radius on a rotating object is 

:&lt;math&gt;a = v^2/r&lt;/math&gt;, 

where v is the velocity and r is the distance from the center.  The distance traveled per rotation period is 2 pi r, so the velocity of any point between the tip and center is proportional to r.  Thus the acceleration at any point varies linearly with radius, and the average acceleration over the radius is half that at the tip.  The same type of constant stress design as for a vertical cable leads to a tapering area from center to tip, except instead of a constant gravity along the length of a vertical cable, we have a varying acceleration in the rotating cable.

We can set up a ratio of characteristic tip velocity to orbit velocity for a given rotating design and the planet or body it operates on or near. This gives us a measure of usefulness for rotating devices in that location. The characteristic tip velocity is that produced under 1 scale length of load (in average acceleration x length).  You can build devices which rotate faster, but at the cost of increasing taper factor, and thus increasing mass, relative to the supported load or payload.

===Table of Material Properties=== 

This table includes ultimate strength and other properties of selected materials, as examples for the structural methods that follow.  Strength is not the only important property for material selection.  If doing a detailed design you should do a full search for available materials and also consider all design factors before a final selection.  Real designs will have a factor of safety, which is not included in this table, and will also have structural overhead for items like connector fittings and coatings. The overhead can be treated as extra loads to be supported or a reduction in the useful strength of the material.

The strongest materials are fibers which are strong in tension.  In order to use them for compression structures, they have to be embedded in a matrix of some other material to give them stability.  Otherwise they would simply bend like a thread.  An example is carbon/epoxy, which encapsulates carbon fibers with an epoxy matrix.  A typical ratio by area is 60% fiber and 40% matrix. The epoxy is relatively strong as a plastic by itself, but most of the strength comes from the fibers.


==A. Static Structures ==

Static structures have parts which are mostly fixed in relation to each other, although the structure as a whole may move with respect to the ground. Large structures are primarily governed in their design by the ratio of strength to density, or specific strength. That ratio is converted to a scale height by dividing by the local acceleration. Other important properties for a large structure include stiffness, temperature dependence of properties, and resistance to decay from the surrounding environment. 

Some method to travel the height or length of the structure is often required. These methods include: '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator conventional elevator]''' (which does not need further explanation), incremental winch, '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motor linear motor]''', and fluid transfer.

'''Incremental winch''' - With tall structures, a hanging cable such as used with conventional elevators which spans the entire height ends up duplicating the loads of the supporting structure and would be quite massive.  Instead this method has a small motor driven trolley which pulls a length of cable behind it as it climbs up the structure. The cable is unreeled from a spool on the elevator compartment. The trolley then hooks the cable to a fixed point on the structure some reasonable distance up.  The cargo elevator remains attached to the next lower point on the structure during this time. The elevator then reels in the spool like a winch to pull itself up from one attachment point to the next. By this method the cable length and mass are kept relatively low. 

The elevator car requires independent power for the winch. This can be by rails or wires embedded in the structure, solar arrays or other power source attached to the elevator compartment, or beamed power from an outside source

'''Linear Motor''' - Instead of a cable, this uses either traction or magnetic force to climb the structure. Traction would use friction pressure against a rail or cable, or geared drivers against a linear toothed rail.  Magnetic forces would use coils functioning as an electric motor, but instead of the coils being in a circle and producing rotation as in an ordinary motor, they are in a line producing a linear motion.  Magnetic Leviataion (MagLev) trains work this way. As in the winch it needs an external power source such as rails.

'''Fluid transfer''' - Rather than moving an elevator compartment, a pipe could be used for higher volume transfer.  Dr. Dana Andrews, formerly with Boeing, suggested pumping Oxygen gas generated on the Lunar surface up to the Lunar L2 point on a Lunar space elevator.  A column of Oxygen at .1 atmosphere at L2, and a temperature of 1000 K (a solar heated pipe can be used to keep the gas hot) would have a pressure of 2310 atm (234 MPa) at the bottom. So a single pressurized pipe section puts heavy loads on the design. A better approach is to have pumping stations spaced along the tower, to keep the pressure rise at each station low.  A pipe could also serve as a pneumatic system to transport cargo besides gases.  The depth of the gravity well will determine the practicality of this method.

Regardless of the method used, lifting a mass against gravity or centrifugal acceleration takes energy by the potential energy formula PE = mah, where m is mass, a is acceleration against which you are lifting, and h is the height.  For example, a 2000 kg passenger elevator climbing 10 meters per second in Earth gravity requires 2000 x 10 x 9.81 = 196,200 Watts.


====1. Large Towers (Compression Structures)==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Skyscrapers, Megastructures

'''Type:''' Potential Energy via Mechanical Traction 

'''Description:'''  As noted in the material properties table above, advanced aerospace materials have scale lengths of many kilometers, so it is possible to build towers in that size range. Such towers can be used as a high altitude observation platform, a launch platform for a propulsive vehicle, or a support structure for an accelerator system. In theory a tower of unlimited height could be built.  At some height, though, the exponential growth of the base area and total structural weight and cost makes it impractical to go higher. If we assume a factor of safety of 2.5 and a practical limit of the tower weight is 100 times the payload weight, a carbon/epoxy tower on Earth would thus be limited to about 150 km in height. 

In a real structure the load (the mass you are supporting besides the structure itself) probably won't all be at the top, so the calculation will has to account for additions of load masses distributed along the height. Additionally, for the bottom 20 kilometers or so on Earth, wind loads, ice build-up, and other environmental effects have to be accounted for. Above 20 km, ultraviolet light and atomic oxygen can attack certain structural materials.  This is not commonly a problem at low altitude, so you need a protective layer for the structure or choose different materials.  

A large tower would typically be built as a truss, like antenna masts or the Eiffel Tower.  The space between the vertical elements in a truss gives it stability, but it does not have to be a solid structure to support most reasonable payload masses. Truss elements will bend if too much load is placed along their length (imagine pressing on the ends of a drinking straw or spaghetti noodle).  Stiffness or '''Modulus of Elasticity''' is what resists this bending. To make best use of the strength, the design is often made so that buckling (failure from bending) and crushing (failure from direct load) happen at the same time. For high strength materials this results in individual elements roughly 20 times longer than their smallest cross section.  It also results in the tower as a whole being roughly 20 times taller than the base width. Those are only generic values, the real ratio would be determined by the designer based on actual design conditions.

These types of towers can be built 'from the top down' in order to avoid human construction work in a vacuum. In this process, the top section of the tower is assembled at ground level. Jacks raise the tower up by one section length. The next section down is then installed underneath. The process is repeated for the whole tower height, so all the construction work takes place near ground level. Special anchoring provisions are required to stabilize the tower while being built in this fashion. If remote controlled robots are used for construction, then the standard method of building from bottom to top can be used. To reduce wind loads in the lower 20 km, the structural elements can be enclosed in pivoting airfoils, which have a much lower drag coefficient than circular or triangular struts.

'''Status:''' The tallest man-made above-ground structure is the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai at 830 m (2723 ft or 0.51 miles ). The tallest freestanding structure is the Magnolia tension leg oil platform, which is 1580 m ( 5200 ft) from the sea floor to the top of the surface platform. Some engineering/ architectural studies on very large towers have been
done. No attempts to build anything over 1000 meters above ground are known. Versions of this concept are within current technology for structural materials, although it may require an advance in construction techniques. 

'''Variations:'''

* '''1a Unguyed Tower''' - In an unguyed tower, the base of the tower needs to be 1/10 to 1/20 of the tower height to avoid buckling (uncontrolled bending of structural elements). In the lower part of the tower, wind loads may require the base to spread at a greater slope than the upper part, which only depends on buckling for its necessary width. This approach assumes that most of the loads on the tower act vertically, as in an elevator riding up and down the tower height. If it is built as an open truss, as is likely, the spaces between the vertical structural elements can be used for other purposes. 

* '''1b Guyed Tower''' - If the loads are substantially sideways the tower may be stabilized by a set of guy wires that spread out at a 30-45 degree angle.  This is commonly done with television and radio towers because the antenna itself is not very heavy, and so the main loads are winds on the lightweight tower structure. 

* '''1c Series of Towers''' -  A very long, tall structure, such as a 300 km long electromagnetic accelerator, may use a series of towers of increasing height as supports, with connecting structure similar to a suspension bridge between them.

====2. Space Elevator (Tension Structures)====

'''Alternate Names:''' Skyhook, Beanstalks, Jacob's Ladder, Space Bridge, Geosynchronous Towers, Orbital Tethers

'''Type:''' Potential Energy via Mechanical Traction

'''Description:''' Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first envisioned a space elevator in 1895.  This was theorized to reach from the ground all the way past geosynchronous orbit.  Since geosynchronous by definition has the same orbit period as the Earth's rotation, the structure as a whole appears to be motionless, and to reach space you merely ride an elevator up.  This theoretical construct is often used in popular illustrations of space elevators, but early 21st century materials are not strong enough to make full GEO space elevators practical.  Smaller versions with shorter cables, however, do result in feasible designs.  We will call these '''Partial Elevators''' since they only do part of the job of going from ground to orbit. If they are not connected to the ground, they are not required to be centered on a 24 hour orbit. They can be located in whatever orbit is needed, and will appear to be in motion when viewed from the ground.  For bodies smaller than the Earth a full elevator is more feasible, because of the smaller gravity well.

Where a tower has to resist the compression force created by gravity against the solid surface of a body, a space elevator needs to resist the tension created by the difference in gravity between it's parts, or from it's own rotation.  Structural elements store and transfer momentum and potential energy to vehicles or cargo, and support objects away from the structure's center of mass or under rotation. Structures in orbit will naturally tend to align vertically because gravity forces increase as the square of distance.  Thus the lower end of a vertical cable has a lower potential relative to the center by more than the higher end sees a higher potential. The total energy of a vertical cable is less than that of a horizontal one, so it tends to &quot;fall&quot; into that state.  The difference in gravity (otherwise known as tides) provides tension to keep the structure extended.

Partial elevators can be built any size up to the practical limit of the materials used. In the lower limit of zero length a space elevator reduces to a simple object in orbit.  For intermediate lengths and vertical the orbit velocity of the bottom end is the velocity of the center times the ratio of bottom to center's distance from the center of the body.  That velocity can be further reduced if you rotate the cable such that the bottom end travels opposite the orbit direction. The design limits for this type of elevator is then governed by the mass and cost of the structure growing exponentially as you make it more capable.  The structure can be used multiple times over it's design life, so the cost per use is lowered by that ratio. At some point that lower cost by multiple use is overcome by the increasing mass and cost of a larger structure no matter how many times it is used.  So economics will be the limiting factor on large elevators.

Whatever velocity the bottom end has relative to the ground has to be provided by some other transport system, but that is less than is needed by a transport system without an elevator.  The difficulty of building a transport system is also non-linear with velocity, like the elevator.  By using both, the sum of smaller exponents is less than each exponent by itself, so the total cost and difficulty is less.  The other transport system does not place itself fully in orbit, only the cargo does via the elevator, which is less total energy per delivery.  The cable serves as a '''momentum bank''' to store orbital kinetic energy, which can be transferred to a payload.  The kinetic energy can be stored by running an electric propulsion system, which is much more efficient than conventional rockets. So using an elevator lowers the overall difficulty of reaching orbit, and lowers the overall cost if well designed. Material strength to density ratio is the critical criterion for designing these types of transport systems. Their mass is highly non-linear with strength because doubling the strength reduces the exponent part of their mass ratio by half.

:'''''Structural Dynamics:'''''

The forces affecting an elevator design vary with time.  This includes arriving and departing vehicles, internal movement of cargo along the structure or deployment of extension cables, thrust for orbit maintenance and rotation, varying gravity in an elliptical orbit or if the elevator is rotating, varying tidal forces from the Sun, Moon, or planet satellite, and thermal stress from going into and out of shadow as it orbits. Elevator designs can be truss-like, with sufficient compressive structural elements to keep a stable shape against the varying forces. They can also be cable-like, with primarily tension elements, and the structure allowed to flex with the applied forces, or they can be a mixture of the two.  Active damping for vibrations can be applied with shock absorber/spring combinations or with thrusters along the structure.  

The rotation state of the elevator can be vertical, which is one rotation per orbit when seen from inertial space; swinging, where it varies by some angle from vertical but does not do a full rotation relative to the ground; or rotating where it does rotate relative to the ground.  The rotation sense can be forward, where it is the same direction as the orbit around the planet, or backward where it is opposite.  Normally it would be forward, since that results in lower velocity at the bottom end relative to the ground, and higher velocity at the upper end for injection into transfer or escape orbits.

Because of the typically high slenderness ratio (ratio of length to maximum width) and varying forces noted above, the structural dynamics will be complex and require a good theoretical understanding and likely computer simulation.  A further complexity is unlike terrestrial skyscrapers, which are constructed empty and then loaded when complete and not usually changed afterwards, a space elevator may grow over time while already operating. This is likely because a larger elevator can assist in it's own construction by reducing the work for a launch system, and can help offset it's cost by operating as soon as possible.  Thus instead of analyzing a completed building and then checking construction loads do not exceed design loads, a growing elevator would need analysis over a continuous range of sizes.

'''Status:''' - Hanging cables have long been used on Earth for numerous purposes.  The '''Tethered Satellite System''' was an experiment to deploy a cable in orbit from the Space Shuttle but it (descibe failure).

'''Variations:''' 

* '''2a Orbital Vertical Elevator''' - The original concept, where the cable is kept vertical in smaller versions by tidal forces, or in larger versions by sufficient cable or counterweight past GEO to apply tension to the part below GEO.  Mass grows exponentially with gravity well depth.  Therefore a compressive tower built up from the ground meeting a cable from above results in lower total mass, because it splits the structural task into two smaller exponentials.  Despite that, current materials are not sufficient for a full vertical elevator on Earth. They are for smaller bodies such as the Moon or Mars.

* '''2b Momentum Transfer Slingshot''' - If a payload is released from the end of a vertical elevator, the other end of it's orbit will be changed about 7 times the initial distance from the elevator center of mass.  This is because while attached the payload is forced to move at a different velocity than a free object would at that altitude.  Once released, it then follows the free orbit defined by its release velocity.  This variation increases the orbit change by adding partial rotation and dynamic extension of a cable.

An orbital tether system variation of potential value is the orbital slingshot. This would take advantage of the tendency of a long object to auto-rotate from horizontal to vertical orientation with the center of mass at orbital velocity, due to &quot;tidal&quot; effects.
 
A relatively light weight vehicle, launched conventionally, would dock with a much more massive &quot;orbital momentum bank&quot; (largely consisting of discarded rocket stages left at the bank with each launch), and be hooked to a reel of tether. The vehicle would be pushed out to a somewhat higher orbit, where it would fall behind the momentum bank, with tether being paid out at a matching rate.
 
After sufficient tether has been paid out, it would be braked to a halt, putting it under tension. The momentum bank would slow and fall inward, while the vehicle would accelerate and fall outward, to be released at the desired orientation and velocity to transfer to a higher orbit.  Unlike an &quot;elevator&quot; system, the tether need not be long enough to continuously reach the ultimate orbit, as the vehicle will be &quot;slung&quot; outward. 
 
The momentum bank would lose velocity in this maneuver, but could use highly efficient solar powered thrusters (plasma, ion, magnetic) to recover that loss over an extended period.  A couple of momentum banks could be used in series the achieve higher orbits or greater final velocities.
 
If the momentum bank uses an elliptical orbit (cheaper for a rocket launched vehicle to intercept), it may be possible to insert objects into near-circular orbits by slinging at apogee.  Or the vehicle would take on fuel to circularize its orbit after being slung - the momentum bank station would be a convenient place to cache fuel for vehicles bound further out.

* '''2c Orbital Rotating Elevator (Skyhook)''' - A more recent idea devised around 1980 where the cable is kept in tension by sufficient rotation rate.  On smaller bodies where the cable end can dip low enough to grab cargo and lift it to orbit gives it the name '''Skyhook'''.  For Earth reaching that low is difficult because of the high tip velocity and mass needed.  Instead a vehicle coming from the ground provides enough velocity to meet a slower rotating tip.  Again, both launch vehicle and Skyhook mass ratios are exponential in velocity, so splitting the job lowers the overall difficulty.

For example, if we assume a cable has a tip acceleration of 1 gravity, and we allow a mass ratio of e^2, or two working lengths, and the working length is 50 km, then the radius can be 200 km.  From the centrifugal formula, then 10 m/^2 = (v^2)/200,000 m.  Solving for v gives 1400 m/s, or about 20% of Earth orbit velocity.  So a modest structural design can reach a significant fraction of orbital speed.

* '''2c Atmospheric Elevator''' - An aircraft or balloon/airship uses a cable to lift an object to altitude, after which it continues to orbit by other methods. With an aircraft this can be a simple tow cable where one vehicle pulls another, or a cable system which dynamically snatches and accelerates a vehicle, possibly tossing it higher than the aircraft flies. It requires less modification of the towing aircraft and not having to deal with combined aerodynamics. For an airship type lifter, it avoids having to build a tower that height, although cargo mass is relatively limited.

====3. Aerostat====

'''Alternate Names:''' High altitude balloon, Airship, Inflatable Tower 

'''Type:''' Potential Energy by Aerodynamic forces

'''Description:''' This method uses lift generated by pressure and density differences but not primarily from velocity such as wing lift. One approach to minimizing drag and gravity losses for a launch vehicle is to carry it aloft with a high altitude balloon or airship. Research balloons have carried ton-class payloads in the range of 15-30 km high, which is above the bulk of the atmosphere. Another approach that has been proposed is to use pressure-supported structures of great height. The highest strength materials are strong in tension, so an inflated structure in theory can support itself.  Wind loads on a large pressurized structure are a major design issue. If a less dense gas is used than the surrounding atmosphere, the structure will be partially buoyant and not require the same scaling as one that depends on compressive strength. Sufficiently large structures, which would have low surface to volume ratios, could float just from heating the interior air. 

'''Status:''' Balloons, airships, and pressure supported structures have been in use for a number of years, and some experiments have been done to launch a rocket from a balloon.  They have not reached orbit yet.

'''Variations:'''

* '''3a Balloon Carrier''' - A device producing life and carrying an instrument package or launch vehicle, but not a propulsion system of it's own. They have been used extensively on Earth for science, and been proposed for other planets.
* '''3b Airship''' - A device combining buoyant lift and and some combination of aerodynamic lift and forward propulsion.
* '''3c Orbital Airship''' - This concept has been proposed by '''[http://www.jpaerospace.com/ JP Aerospace]'''.  It involves a very lightweight airship which starts from a floating platform and accelerates via solar-electric thrusters to orbital velocity.  It is not known if this is technically possible.
* '''3d Geodesic Sphere''' - A triangulated frame supporting a pressure skin can float with merely a temperature difference between inside and outside if sufficiently large.  Since structure mass goes with area, and lifting force goes with volume, if built sufficiently large it will float.
* '''3e Pressure Supported Tower''' - Uses lift force from higher interior pressure to raise a structure.  This can be generalized to pressurizing any structural element to help support it.

====4. Low-Density Tunnel==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Kinetic Energy by Aerodynamic Forces 

'''Description:''' Traveling to or from a large body with an atmosphere, such as the Earth, can produce large losses from drag and heating.  Aerodynamic drag has a gas density factor in it's formula. This concept reduces or avoids those losses by using a lower density gas or vacuum.  Lower density can be obtained by using a gas with a lower atomic weight, such as Hydrogen, or by pumping out some or all of the gas.  This is not a transport method in and of itself, but rather a way to avoid losses.

'''Status:''' Low pressure pipes are a common device.  It has not been tried for space transport.

'''Variations:'''

* '''4a Light Gas Tunnel''' - One or more light gas balloons or pipes are strung along the path of a vehicle or projectile. The gas has a lower density than air. The formula for drag is 0.5*C(d)*Rho*A*v^2, where Rho is the density. Thus the lower density will lower drag.  High speed travel through any gas will develop shock waves, so the size of the projectile relative to the size of the tunnel needs to be small enough that the shock waves will not damage the structure.

* '''4b Evacuated Tunnel''' - An evacuated tunnel is supported up through the atmosphere by a combination of towers or it's own lift from displacing air.. A launch system such as an electromagnetic accelerator fires a projectile up through the tunnel. Drag losses are minimized within the tunnel, and are low in the remaining part of the atmosphere beyond the tunnel. The top end requires some way to keep air from flowing in and filling the tunnel - such as a hatch that remains closed until the accelerator is about to fire.

====5. Magnetically Supported Structure====

'''Alternate Names:''' Startram

'''Type:''' Magnetic Storage by Magnetic Field

'''Description:''' A static or time varying magnetic field produces a force to support a structure.  For example, a series of large superconducting coils stacked so they repel each other and support a cargo. Alternately current carrying wires generate repulsion between the ground and the structure.

'''Status:''' Startram is a concept proposed using magnetic levitation, but has not reached experimental versions yet.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:'''


==B. Dynamic Structures== 

Static structures rely on constant forces such as from the strength of materials to hold themselves up. Dynamic structures rely on the forces generated by rapidly moving parts to hold up the structure. The advantage of this approach is it can support structures beyond the limits of material strengths. The disadvantage is that if the machinery that controls the moving parts fails, the structure falls apart. 


====6. Fountain/Mass Driver==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' An electromagnetic accelerator provides a stream of masses moving up vertically. A series of coils decelerates the masses as they go up, then accelerates them back down again, at a few times local gravity. When they reach bottom, the accelerator slows them down and throws them back up again, at a high multiple of local gravity. Thus the accelerator is many times shorter than the fountain height. The reaction of the coils to the acceleration of the fountain of masses provides a lifting force that can support a structure. The lifting force is distributed along where the coils are located. This can be along the length of a tower, or concentrated at the top, with the stream of masses in free-flight most of the way. 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:'''

====7. Launch Loop==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A strip or sections of a strip are maintained at super-orbital velocities. They are constrained by magnetic forces to support a structure, while being prevented from leaving orbit. A vehicle rides the strip, using magnetic braking against the strip's motion to accelerate. Several concepts using super-orbital velocity structures have been proposed. One is known as the 'launch loop'. In this concept a segmented metal ribbon is accelerated to more than orbital velocity at low Earth orbit. The ribbon is restrained from rising to higher apogees by a series of cables suspended from magnetically levitated hardware supported by the ribbons. The ribbon is guided to ground level in an evacuated tube, and turned 180 degrees using magnets on the ground. A vehicle going to orbit rides an elevator to a station where the cable moves horizontally at altitude. The vehicle accelerates using magnetic drag against the ribbon, then releases when it achieves orbital velocity.

====8. Multi-Stage Space Elevator==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A multi-stage space elevator has more than one structural element, with the parts in relative motion. For example, a vertically hanging cable in Earth orbit can have a rotating cable at it's lower end. The advantage of such an arrangement is to lower the mass ratio of cable to payload compared to a single cable. The mass ratio of a rotating cable is approximately proportional to exp(tip velocity squared). If two cables each supply half the tip velocity, then the ratio becomes exp(2(tip velocity/2)squared), which is a smaller total mass ratio. Another feature of a multi-stage elevator is that the tip velocity vector of the two stages add. Since one rotates with respect to the other, the sum of the vectors changes over time. Given suitable choices of tip velocities and angular rates, one can receive and send payloads with arbitrary speed and direction up to the sum of the two vectors. The dynamics of a multi-stage elevator are complex.

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:'''

* '''8a Hanging/Rotating Elevator''' - This consists of a vertical/nonrotating space elevator structure with a rotating second stage at one or both ends.  This is more suited for within a gravity well, where the gravitational gradient will stabilize the first stage.
* '''8b Rotating/Rotating Elevator''' - This consists of two stages, both of which are rotating, to get reduced mass ratio for a given velocity.  This is more suited for free space application where the lack of varying gravity across the structure will simplify the dynamics.

This section covers Guns and Accelerators.  Although the details are quite varied, what they share is a larger fixed installation which provides acceleration to a smaller projectile or cargo.  The construction of a large fixed device is justified if you use it many times and the maintenance per use is moderate.

===A. Mechanical Accelerators=== 

As the name indicates, this group uses direct force from the device structure.
  
====9 Leveraged Catapult==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A leveraged catapult uses a relatively large or heavy driver to accelerate a smaller payload at several gravities by mechanical means. Such devices date back to the Medieval period, but this is an updated version using modern materials. Devices such as a multiple sheave pulley or a gear train convert a large force moving slowly to a small force moving fast, and transmit the force along a cable. The mechanical advantage produces more than one gravity of acceleration. This concept may be one of the simplest to implement on a small scale. Despite the seeming simplicity of the concept, velocities of several km/s are possible, which would greatly reduce the size of a rocket needed to provide the balance of the velocity to orbit. The performance of this concept reaches a limit due to the weight, drag, and heating of the cable attached to the payload and the magnitude of the driving force, which is divided by the leverage ratio to yield the force on the payload. 

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

* '''9a Drop Weight''' -  A falling mass is connected to a vehicle by a high strength cable running over a multiple-sheave pulley, cable reels with different diameters, or connected with a gearing ratio. Two types of natural locations with large height difference are possibilities - river gorges and mountain peaks. Locations such as the Grand Canyon and the Columbia River gorge have lots of vertical relief for the drop weight. At these locations the weight can consist of a large fabric bag filled with water from the river at the bottom. The bag can be emptied before hitting bottom. This reduces the weight that has to be stopped by a braking system. For mountain peak locations, the drop weight runs down a set of rails and is stopped by running into a body of water or running up an opposing hillside plus possibly wheel braking. The mountain location may be preferred because of the greater launch altitude. This example assumes a mountain with a solid weight sliding on rails: 

We assume that a 15,000 kg cryogenic rocket using RL-10 engines is being thrown. An acceleration of 60 m/s^2 is tolerable by humans for the 20 seconds required to reach 1200 m/s assuming the human is in good health and properly supported. The linear path traversed would be 12,000 m (7.5 miles) at constant acceleration. The tow cable pulls with 900 kN (202,000 lb) of force on the rocket. High strength carbon fiber is available with tensile strengths of up to 6.9 GPa (1,000 ksi). Allowing for a factor of safety and a braided overwrap surrounding the fiber bundle (to protect the carbon fibers from abrasion), we assume a working stress of 3.45 GPa (500 ksi). The cross sectional area required is then 0.00026 m^2, or a circular cable 0.0182 m (0.72 inch) in diameter. 

With a density of 1840 kg/m^3, the cable mass is 0.48 kg/m. For a 12,000 m long cable, the mass would be 5,760 kg without allowing for taper. Since the cable has to be accelerated also, the leading end, closer to the drive mechanism, has to be able to apply sufficient force to accelerate the rocket and all the cable in between the rocket and leading end. To a first approximation, the leading end must be 40% larger in cross section than the trailing end to account for the acceleration of the cable itself. The mean weight of the cable is then 0.576 kg/m, giving a cable mass of 7,000 kg. Something has to be done with the cable after it finishes the job of accelerating the vehicle. It can be taken care of by looping the cable back from the drive mechanism to the starting point (where the vehicle is at the start). At the completion of a launch, the loop of cable is moving at 1200 m/s, and is gradually allowed to come to a stop. Some method will be required to reduce hoop stress on the cable as it makes turns around a pulley at high velocity.

The return portion of the cable has to be able to accelerate the part of the cable past the drive mechanism at 6 g's. Given a 7000 kg lead section, we get a mass of 3200 kg. Thus the total mass accelerated at 6 g's is 25,200 kg, and the total accelerating force is 1.512 MN. Given a 45 degree slope on a mountain, we assume that the drop weight accelerates down at 3 m/s^2. Thus the gear ratio is 20:1, and the force of the drop weight on the drive system must be 30.24 MN. Since a free-falling weight on this slope would accelerate at 7 m/s, there is a 4 N/kg retarding force due to the drive system. Therefore the drop weight must be 7,560 tons. If it is a 4 meter square block of steel (about the cross section of a railroad car), it will weigh 124.8 tons per meter, and hence must be 60.6 meters long. The rails must be 12,000 m/20 long, or 600 meters long. 
  
* '''9b Locomotive Driver''' - A set of railroad locomotives provides the motive force, which is multiplied by a gear mechanism to a higher speed. Example: launching a 20,000 lb 
vehicle at 3 g's to 1100 m/s.  This requires a 20 km straight run of track. The rail cars needed would include: 

: 1 tank car for vehicle fuel
: 1 special purpose car to carry the glider 
: 2-3 cars with tow rope guides to keep the tow rope off the ground.
: 1 pulley system car
: 30 locomotives in tandem.

We assume the locomotive top speed is about 27 m/s, therefore a 40:1 gear ratio will provide the desired speed at the vehicle. Locomotive traction averages 80,000 lb/engine, or 2000 lb per engine when reduced through the gear ratio. The gear-down mechanism and launch cable drum are mounted on a flatbed rail car. This car can be anchored to a foundation on either side of the railroad track to hold it in place when the combined pull of the locomotives is exerted. The starting traction of 30 locomotives is 1800 tons. Since the couplings between engines are probably not designed for this load, a set of steel cables on both sides of the locomotives are used to transmit the traction force from each engine to the gear mechanism. The vehicle is attached to the anchored rail car by a high-strength cable which is 20 km long. At 3 g's it takes this distance to accelerate to the desired speed. 

Two or three rail cars are spaced out along the 20 km with towers with a pulley wheel on top, to guide the cable and keep it off the ground during the initial acceleration. The vehicle has glider type wings attached that will generate lift as it gains speed, so the vehicle will climb once it reaches 100 m/s or so. When the vehicle reaches the desired speed, the cable is released and the vehicle continues to climb under the glider's lift. Eventually the glider drops the vehicle, which proceeds under rocket power.  Although 30 locomotives is a lot, you only have to lease them long enough to do a launch, after which they can return to normal railroad use. 

A small prototype would consist of a single Locomotive driver. 1250 lb rocket @ 4 g peak. Final velocity = 700 m/s. Accel time = 17.5 sec distance = 0.5at2 = 6.1 km. Engine traction = 
80,000 lb average @ 25:1 gear ratio. 

* '''9c Jet Driver''' - This is similar to the locomotive case, but the gear ratio is lower since the jet can reach a higher speed on a take-off run. Example: an F-15 can tow 40,000 lb rope tension if near empty. @10:1 gear ratio can accelerate 1000 lb object @ 4 g's. Aircraft top speed on deck = 300 m/s. Object top speed in theory would be 3000 m/s. In practice would be limited by aerodynamics and cable heating (perhaps to 1500 m/s? limit is not well understood)

====10 Rotary Sling==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Centrifuge Catapult 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' In principle, this is a sling or bolo scaled up and using aerospace materials. Rotating cables can reach a significant fraction of orbit velocity on Earth, or all of orbit velocity on smaller bodies.  A drive arm is driven in rotation by methods such as an electric motor, or a jet mounted on its tip. In larger versions a cable with the payload attached to the end is played out gradually as the system comes up to speed. The drive arm leads the cable slightly so the cable and payload see a torque that continues to accelerate them. When the desired payload velocity is reached, the payload releases and flies off. The cable is then retracted and the drive arm slows down. When it stops, another payload is attached.  In smaller versions the cargo can be connected directly to the drive arm without a cable.

In a vacuum, such as on the Lunar surface, this is theoretically a very efficient system, as the sling can be driven by an electric motor and the mechanical losses can be held to a low value. Some method of recovering the energy of the arm and cable (such as by transferring it to a second system by using the motor as a generator), can lead to efficiencies over 60% in theory.  

On bodies with an atmosphere, such as the Earth, the system is hindered by air drag. One method of reducing drag is to attach an aerodynamic shape to the cable material, so as to lower drag compared to a circular cable. Another is to mount the drive arm on the top of a large tower, so the cable is not moving in dense gas. A third is to generate lift along the cable or at the payload raising its altitude. The rapidly moving part of the cable near the payload then has less drag.

A counterweight is desirable in situations where the unbalanced load of the cargo would put too much stress on the pivot and supporting structure.  The counterweight gets released at the same time as the cargo. Due to gyroscopic effects, the rotating cable will attempt to keep it's axis of rotation fixed. When attached to a rotating body such as the Earth, the location and mounting of the cable will have to take that into account.

'''Design Example:'''

This example is for a terrestrial sling with a tip velocity of 1800 m/s, or about 24% of Earth orbital velocity, and a cargo of 10,000 kg including propulsion for going to orbit:

:- Assume tip acceleration is 10 gravities (100 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for non-living cargo. 
:- Then r = 32,400 meters. 
:- For a 10,000 kg projectile at end, cable tension is 1 MN. If carbon fiber is used with a 3400 MPa design stress, then cable area is 1/3400 m2, or about 3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. 
:- Cable mass is 0.6 kg/meter, adds 60 N/meter at tip.  The implied scale length is 16.67 km. Acceleration falls linearly with radius, so effective radius is 16.2 km for load purposes, and cable mass ratio is 2.8:1.  Therefore cable mass is 18,000 kg.  
:- To spin up in 1 hour, we need an average accelerating force of 0.5 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 5000 N. 
:- Drag counteracts the accelerating force. Assume the cable is shaped to be 1 cm tall by 3 cm deep. Since drag is proportional to velocity squared, and velocity goes linear with radius, drag over the entire length will be 1/3 that at the tip. At the tip drag is 0.5 Cd rho A v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Cd = 0.04 for shaped airfoil. rho = 1.225 kg/m3 at sea level. A = 0.01 m2. v = 1800 m/s. Then tip drag = 2381 N/m, or 1/3 x 32,400 m x 2381 N/m = 25.72 MN at sea level.
:- If we assume our drive motor can produce a peak of 4 times the average accelerating force, then peak drag can be at most 15,000 N.  The motor is then driven to maintain a surplus of 5000 N force above drag. Since sea level drag is 1715 too high, we want to go to an altitude where density is that factor lower, or 7.14 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This density is at 53 km altitude. The cable will drape in a curve due to the combination of radial and gravity forces, so the tower height will need to be approx 60 km.  

'''Status:''' Slings and bolos are ancient devices.  So far as is known, a modern one for space transport has not been built

'''Variations:'''

:* '''10a Jet Driven Sling''' - A jet engine is mounted to the rotating arm in order to get high starting torque.  The launch velocity is increased by the ratio of cargo radius to jet radius from the pivot point.
:* '''10b Two Stage Sling''' - A second rotating cable or arm is mounted on the first one to reduce mass ratio of the entire system.  This adds complexity, so is only an advantage where the mass ratio of a single stage version becomes too extreme.

===B. Artillery===

Guns have been in use in the West since about 1300 AD.  A &quot;space gun&quot; is merely one large enough, and with a high enough muzzle velocity, to be useful for space transport purposes. It also needs to point sufficiently above the horizon for the projectile not to hit the terrain, and lower the amount of air to travel through.  The earliest illustration of using a cannon to reach orbit is from Isaac Newton's ''Principia Mathematica'', where he was illustrating the concepts of gravity and orbits.  Thus the idea is as old as orbit mechanics.  In the 20th century rockets were developed for ballistic missiles and then placing payloads into orbit.  They were able to reach higher velocities with lower maximum acceleration and infrastructure at the time. Even though guns have a much longer heritage, and both artillery and rockets are both still used by military forces, they were bypassed in the early part of the Space Age.


====11 Solid Propellant Charge==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' This method uses an explosive charge which vaporizes behind a projectile in a barrel. The high gas pressure generated this way accelerates the projectile to high velocity. Conventional artillery reaches speeds of around 1000 m/s. Velocities much higher than this are difficult to reach because the barrel mass becomes extreme at higher pressures, and the temperature and molecular weight of the resulting gas limits the internal speed of sound, which in turn limits muzzle velocity.

'''Status:''' Artillery has a long history and extensive use. The High Altitude Research Probe project attached two naval gun barrels in series and used relatively light shells to reach higher muzzle velocities than conventional artillery.

====12 Liquid Propellant Charge==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' This is similar to conventional solid propellant artillery except liquid propellants are metered into the chamber, then ignited. Liquid propellants have been studied because they produce lighter molecular weight combustion products, which leads to higher muzzle velocities, and because bulk liquids can be stored more compactly than shells, and require less handling equipment to load. Metering the propellant flow into the barrel lowers the peak pressure relative to a detonation, leading to lighter barrels.

'''Status:''' 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 
  

====13 Gaseous Charge==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A mixture of fuel and oxidizer is introduced into a chamber, and then ignited.  This is similar to how automobile engines function. This method covers projectiles directly driven by the resulting high temperature gas. Indirect drive guns are covered under '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Guns_and_Accelerators2#C._Light_Gas_Gun|Light Gas Guns]]''' on the next page.  The igniter is a separate device in the basic concept.  An alternate version called a '''Scramjet Gun''' uses the projectile itself as a traveling igniter.  It must be moving supersonic to keep the ignition front from getting ahead of it, so it needs a gas injector at the start to get it moving fast enough.

'''Status:''' Research prototypes.  Methane/air mix was used as the driver for the Livermore 2 stage gas gun. The combustion drives a 1 ton piston, which in turn compresses hydrogen working gas. Research on the scramjet gun was being performed at the University of Washington under Prof. Adam Bruckner. Research gun was located in the basement of a building there.

'''Variations:'''

* '''13a Scramjet Gun (Ram Accelerator)''' -  Fuel/oxidizer mixture present in barrel is burned as projectile travels up barrel. If projectile shape resembles two cones base to base, as in an inside-out scramjet, the gas is compressed between the projectile body and barrel wall. The combustion occurs behind the point of peak compression, and produces more pressure on the aft body than the compression on the fore-body. This pressure difference provides a net force accelerating the projectile. 

One attraction of this concept is that a high acceleration launch can occur without the need for the projectile to use on-board propellants. If the projectile has a inlet/nozzle shape (hollow in the middle) it might continue accelerating in the atmosphere by injecting fuel into the air-only incoming flow, extending the performance beyond what a gun alone can do. Another attraction of this concept is the simplicity of the launcher, which is a simple tube capable of withstanding the internal pressure generated during 
combustion.

====14 Rocket Fed Gun==== 

'''Alternate Names:'''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A rocket engine is mounted at the chamber end of a gun to produce hot gas to accelerate projectile. In a conventional gun, all the gas is formed at once as the charge goes off. In this concept the gas is produced by a rocket type engine and fills the barrel with gas as the projectile runs down it. Compared to a conventional gun, the peak pressure is lower, so the barrel is lighter.

{{TOC right}}

Strictly speaking combustion engines with expansion nozzles are also thermal engines since they rely on hot gases. For discussion purposes we placed that group on the previous page, and on this one look at non-combustion thermal engines. It is possible in theory to combine both into a single device, but this is not usually considered for practical design reasons.  Performance is always important, and light molecules have higher exhaust velocity at a given temperature.  Therefore the tendency is to use Hydrogen if practical since it is the lightest molecule.  Liquid Hydrogen requires extremely cold temperatures (14K or -435F), so storage for long periods is not practical for a small tank.  Larger systems have better surface to volume ratios and can use active cooling to keep it liquid.


==Electro-thermal Engines==

Electro-thermal methods convert externally supplied electric power to heating of the propellant.

====36 Electric-Rail Rocket==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Electrothermal Ramjet

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Power Line

'''Description:''' High voltage electricity supplied by rails is shorted through a tungsten heat exchanger in the engine. This heats Hydrogen carried by the vehicle traveling between the rails. The rails are assumed to be set up on an incline.  Performance would be the same as a nuclear thermal rocket, about 9 km/s exhaust velocity, since both use heated Hydrogen limited by the melting point of the engine components.  It requires very high power levels for large vehicles: 44 MW / ton / g acceleration.  Since power is coming from outside the vehicle, it can generate enough thrust for launch from Earth.  Since the Hydrogen fuel is only stored for a short period, insulation and boiloff are not major problems. This method would compete with other ground accelerator type systems such as gas guns or electromagnetic coils.

'''Status:''' Concept only at this time.

====37 Resistojet==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Photovoltaic Array

'''Description:''' In this method sunlight generates electricity, which is used to heat gas passed over or through a heating element, often after catalytic decomposition of a storable fuel to a lighter gas.  In principle it is similar to the Electric rail rocket, but is used for smaller thrusters in orbit with attached solar array as power source.  This limits the thrust, so it is not powerful enough to use for launch. Compared to chemical thrusters it gets about 50% better exhaust velocity&lt;ref&gt;Seitzman, J. [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/jseitzma/classes/ae6450/electrothermal_thrusters.pdf '''Electrothermal Thrusters'''], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Status:''' This method was used to extend the operating life of communications satellites, since they had large solar arrays for their main job.  The recent tendency is to use ion thrusters, which have even better performance.

==Photo-thermal Engines==

This group uses direct electromagnetic radiation (photons) from natural or artificial sources to heat the propellant.

====38 Solar-Thermal Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Solar Flux

'''Description:'''  In this method sunlight is concentrated by a reflector or lens, and then heats an absorber. The absorber transfers heat to a working fluid, usually Hydrogen. The Hydrogen is then expanded through a nozzle. If the absorber is in the form of pipes, the exhaust velocity is limited to about 9 km/s.  If the absorber is in the form of a particle bed, which does not require mechanical strength, refractory carbides can be used.  Tantalum hafnium carbide, formula Ta&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HfC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, is hypothesized to have a melting point of 4488 K (7619 F) and would set an upper limit to the particle bed method.  There are obvious difficulties in testing that material as no other container could hold it when melted. The bed is rotated to keep the particles from being blown out, and Hydrogen flow is from the outside in, then out a nozzle.  Sunlight is focused on the inside surface which is then the hottest point. Hydrogen dissociates above 3000K to single atoms, leading to exhaust velocities slightly above 10 km/s.

Solar concentrators can be very low mass, and use all of the solar spectrum. So they can reach higher power levels than electro-thermal thrusters.  They are more suited to main propulsion rather than orbit maintenance as electro-thermal typically is.  The direction of the Sun is usually not the same as the direction of thrust, and changes over time.  So solar-thermal systems need a way to point the concentrators. One way to handle this is to roll the vehicle about the thrust axis plus pivot the concentrators about a perpendicular axis.  The concentrators are typically large, so need to be assembled or unfolded in orbit.

'''Status:''' Components have been tested by the US Air Force.  Ion and plasma thrusters have become preferred because of their 3-5 times higher exhaust velocity.

====39 Laser-Thermal Engine====

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Laser

'''Description:''' A laser beam from an external source is passed through a window into a chamber. It is then absorbed by a heat exchanger or is focused to create a laser-sustained plasma within the gas flow. Hot gas is then expelled through a nozzle. By using a powerful energy source external to the propellant, exhaust velocity of around 10 km/s can be reached with high thrust to mass. One method of doing this on Earth is with large, ground-based lasers. Alternately the lasers can be at ground level, and a directing mirror is located on top of a large tower.  A vacuum pipe connects the two.  The extra height avoids atmospheric distortion and allows more distance to the horizon. Use of laser propulsion only in an upper stage would allow smaller lasers than are required for a first stage system. Even so, powerful enough lasers are not available yet, which limits the use of the method.  Other methods of supplying energy to a vehicle are likely to be less expensive. 

'''Status:''' Concept only at present.

====40 Laser Detonation-Wave Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Plasma via Laser

'''Description:''' In this method the propellant is a solid block with a flat bottom. A first laser pulse evaporates a layer of propellant. A second, larger, pulse creates a plasma detonation wave, which shocks and heats the propellant layer. The layer expands against the base of the solid block of remaining propellant.  The pulse pattern is repeated as soon as the plasma dissipates and the laser can reach the block again. Because no fuel tank overhead or engine is needed, the vehicles are potentially very cheap, but it requires a powerful laser to function. For example, a 10 kg vehicle accelerated at 2 g's using a 20 km/s exhaust velocity plasma wave would require a pulsed laser with an average power of 2 MW, while large industrial pulsed lasers are about 600 W &lt;ref&gt;JK Lasers [http://www.jklasers.com/pulsed-nd-yag-lasers Pulsed Nd:YAG Lasers spec sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;. Since the propellant temperature is not limited by any container, it can be hotter than other thermal methods, and so have better performance. 

10 kg is a feasible size for this type of vehicle, if the laser can be kept focused on it till it reaches orbit velocity. In theory this would deliver about 6 kg to orbit.  For larger payloads, such as to carry passengers, the laser would need to scale to GigaWatt power levels, which has led to the common saying within space propulsion circles of &quot;there is nothing wrong with laser propulsion except the lack of GigaWatt lasers&quot;.  Similar power levels are generally required of all launch methods carrying metric ton or larger payloads from Earth.  For example, the Space Shuttle Main Engines, of which the Space Shuttle Orbiter used three, each had a power of 9.2 GW. 

'''Status:''' Some detonation experiments have been carried out at small scale in a laboratory.

====41 Microwave Thermal Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow via Microwaves

'''Description:''' For this method microwaves from an external source are absorbed by a heat exchanger or concentrated by a waveguide into the engine. Hydrogen flows through the engine, absorbs the energy, and then exits by a nozzle. A large phased microwave array on the ground can focus onto a rocket-sized area over a range of hundreds of kilometers. Given a way to couple the microwave energy to a working fluid such as Hydrogen, this type of propulsion could provide significant launch vehicle velocities. High power microwave amplifiers exist in a variety of forms with efficiencies up to 75% and power levels up to one megawatt. As compared to Laser Thermal the chief advantage is the availability of high power microwave sources at relatively low cost. A disadvantage is the much larger wavelength of microwaves vs lasers, so maintaining focus over a distance is harder. 

:* Design Example: 10 meter diameter receiver, 5 cm wavelength, 1 km phased array, range = 200 km.

==Nuclear Thermal Engines==

This group use a nuclear reactor to heat the propellant.  They vary in the physical state of the reactor core (solid, liquid, or gas). 

====42 Solid Core Nuclear Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Fission Reactor

'''Description:''' Hydrogen is heated by flowing through a critical '''[[w:Nuclear energy|Nuclear Reactor]]''', then expelled through a nozzle at high velocity.  The low molecular weight of Hydrogen gas allows a higher exhaust velocity, about 9 km/s, than combustion rockets.  Advantages include high power levels and high total stored energy. 

Issues for Nuclear Thermal include: 
* For single missions the energy of the reactor has barely been tapped by the time the hydrogen is consumed, leaving a now radioactive core to work around if refueling for another mission. 
* Radiation shielding is needed for crew and cargo.  To some degree that is mitigated by the need for shielding from the natural space radiation environment.
* Any type of nuclear device raises extensive safety and environmental issues, even if not activated until in orbit, and even if not really warranted for technical reasons. One way around this issue is to mine and use the fissionable materials away from Earth. For example, parts of the Lunar surface have Thorium concentrations of 10 parts per million. If used as reactor fuel, that can provide a net energy of 350 MJ/kg of unprocessed Lunar soil, or about 7 times the energy density of gasoline on Earth.  The processed fuel of course will be 100,000 times higher energy density, but the unprocessed ore energy density is an indicator of the feasibility of mining it.

In comparison to ion and plasma thrusters, nuclear thermal has about 3-5 times lower exhaust velocity, but much higher thrust levels.  The near-instant burns relative to orbit time for nuclear thermal vs. constant burn for electric thrusters reduces the latter's advantage by 30%, but are still are 2.1-3.5 higher.  The choice of method would depend on the importance of fuel mass, which is usually high, so today electric thrusters are usually preferred. In comparison to solar thermal it has about the same performance in terms of exhaust velocity, but higher thrust levels.

'''History'''  The two major American reactor development efforts in the 1960s were KIWI and NERVA. Together with the $328 million spent on technology development, $90 million spent on the Nuclear Rocket Development Station in Nevada, and $153 million on other test facilities, almost $1.4 billion (in then-year dollars) was spent on nuclear rocket development from 1955 to 1972 (see '''[[Space Transport and Engineering Methods/Reference Data|Appendix 2:Reference Data]]''' ).  Although considerable engine testing was done, the problem of solid core fuel damage at high operating temperatures, which are desirable for performance, was not solved.

'''Status:''' Nuclear rockets reached the testing stage in the 1960's under the NERVA program. Lack of actual need in a mission and rising worries about anything nuclear led to a halt in development.  Since then only minor studies have been done.

This increases thrust by about a factor of 3, which is useful for initial launch, then transitions to pure Hydrogen later for higher efficiency.  Exhaust velocity is lowered by about 1/3 when adding Oxygen due to the higher molecular weight of the resulting exhaust.
* '''Particle Bed Nuclear Engine''' - Although the nuclear rocket program was stopped a number of years ago, more recent work at Brookhaven National Laboratories on fluidized particle bed reactors warrants their consideration for launch vehicles. The small particle size (.3 mm) allows high heat transfer rates to the working fluid, hydrogen, and hence potentially high thrust to weight ratios.  The smaller particles also potentially solves the fuel damage problem, as there is less scope for cracking in a fine powder. Exhaust velocity is increased slightly to 10 km/s.

====43 Liquid Core Nuclear==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Fission Reactor

'''Description:''' In order to attain higher performance than a solid core rocket, the reactor core is raised to a high enough temperature to become liquid. Hydrogen is bubbled through the liquid, then exhausted out a nozzle.  The Hydrogen is first used to cool the reactor container, and so the temperature limit is governed by that rather than the melting point of the core.  Expected exhaust velocity is up to 13-15 km/s, but development and testing of this type of engine will be difficult, as test failures can easily squirt the core fluid out the nozzle. 

'''Status:''' Currently a concept only.

====44 Gas Core Nuclear==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Heated Gas Flow by Fission Reactor

'''Description:''' In this version the reactor core is hot enough to be in gaseous form. The Hydrogen flow is seeded with an absorbent material to directly absorb the thermal radiation from the core. The core is kept from leaking out the nozzle either by a transparent container (nuclear light bulb), a flow vortex, which uses the density difference between uranium and hydrogen, or by magnetic separation, which uses the ionization difference between the uranium and the hydrogen. Expected performance ranges from 15-20 km/s for a quartz container, up to 30-50 km/s for a flow vortex.  The latter is in the range of ion or plasma thrusters, but development and testing would be as difficult as for liquid core due to the possibility of ejecting the core during tests.  A solid core reactor producing electricity for an electric thruster would have the same performance as gas core nuclear, with fewer development problems.

'''Status:''' Currently a concept only.

This group of propulsion methods expel solid particles as reaction mass, or accelerate cargo directly.

====45 Rotary Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A one or two stage rotary mechanism mechanically accelerates a small amount of reaction mass, then releases it. In the two stage version, top speeds of ~6 km/s are possible.  The advantage is to be able to use any available material as reaction mass.  The disadvantage is the relatively low ejection velocity.  There is an opportunity to mechanically augment another type of thruster by having it moving backwards relative to the vehicle center when running, thus adding up to 6 km/s to whatever the native exhaust velocity is. The duty cycle of the augmented thruster would be limited to about 25%, because the rest of the time it would be moving in the wrong direction to add velocity.  This raises the issue of many on-off cycles of the thruster.

'''Status:''' Centrifuges and flywheels have long been in use.  Versions optimized for ejecting mass at high velocity are still in the concept stage.

====46 Coilgun Engine/Launcher==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Mass Driver Reaction Engine 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' This is a type of electromagnetic accelerator. A carrier, or bucket, is accelerated by interaction of magnetic fields from 'driver' coils. The carrier holds a reaction mass/cargo, which is released. The bucket is slowed down and reused.  There is no theoretical limit to velocity of this type of device - particle accelerators have reached near lightspeed - but practical limits are likely to be on the order of 10 km/s.  As a vehicle engine it is not dramatically different than other electric thrusters in performance, aside from the benefit of using any bulk mass as propellant.  As a fixed launcher for bulk materials, a large power supply and rapid recycling of the buckets allows very high mass delivery rates to orbit velocity.  Unassisted bulk material will have an orbit that intersects the launch point, so a device in orbit will have to catch the cargo lots and add some velocity to them. 

'''Status:''' This method was extensively studied as part of the &quot;Space Colony&quot; studies of the ~1970's, and prototype parts were built and tested.

====47 Railgun Engine/Launcher==== 

[[File:Railgun-1.svg|thumb|right|480px|Schematic of railgun operation.]]
'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' 

'''Description:''' A railgun consists of two current-carrying rails, and a projectile that creates a short circuit between the rails.  The rails create a vertical magnetic field between them, as the current goes in opposite directions in each rail.  The interaction of the field with the current in the short circuit creates a Lorentz force forward that accelerates a projectile.  In a large version this would be used to launch vehicles in their entirety.  In a smaller version it would eject a reaction mass and function as a propulsion engine.

'''Status:''' Railguns have been under development as replacements for conventional artillery, but are not yet operational as such.  For launch vehicle acceleration, a much larger power supply would be needed, and this has so far been merely a concept

There are a variety of propulsion techniques that use either internally generated or externally supplied photons for propulsion.  Stars, of course, are a natural supply of photons, but a purpose-made light source of sufficient beam intensity can also be used.  Photons, being massless, travel at the maximum possible speed.  Thus they are theoretically the highest possible exhaust velocity. By the same token, being massless, they do not transfer much momentum.

{{TOC right}}


===A. Photon Sails===

As noted above, light does not transfer much momentum.  So the following methods reach useful thrust level by maximizing area to mass ratio.  The large area increases thrust relative to mass.  The resulting structure resembles a terrestrial sail. 


====66 Solar Sail==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Lightsail 

'''Type:''' Solar Flux by Photon Deflection 

'''Description:''' Starlight, for example from the Sun, reflecting off a large area sail produces a force because the momentum of the photons is reversed. The force for perpendicular (normal) reflection is 

:(1+r)(E/c) , 

where r is the reflectivity of the sail, E is the incident light power, and c is the speed of light. Thus even perfectly absorbing surfaces see light pressure, but reflecting ones perform up to twice as well.  No real surface is perfectly reflecting, so analysis of sails needs to take into account the actual optical properties.  At sail angles other than perpendicular to the light source the net force has a direct component from the incident light, and a reflected or diffuse component depending on the surface properties of the sail.  For reflection the incident and reflected angles are the same amount relative to the plane of reflection.  The diffuse component is light scattered by a rough surface into a wide range of angles.  The force is reduces by a cosine factor due to the spread of directions. 

The absorbed component of light is eventually re-radiated by blackbody radiation.  If this happens equally from both sides of the sail, it produces no net thrust.  Coatings can modify the emissivity of each side and therefore give a net thrust.  For high performance sails coatings add too much mass.  It ends up being better to use bare metal foil of high reflectivity and just ignore the small part not reflected.  Thickness so low as to be partially transparent, and micro-perforations smaller than typical light wavelengths can lower weight even further without significantly reducing reflectivity.  Manufacturing, installation, and operation with extremely thin foil sails will be a challenge. The best mass-to-reflectivity material for visible light is an Aluminum/Magnesium alloy.  Despite higher mass, refractory metal foils like Tungsten can be used at much higher temperatures.  Therefore they can be used much closer to stars where light intensity is higher, and develop more thrust.  This can be used for initial kick to outer system missions. The sail shape can be maintained by struts and tension wires, or by the balance of rotation and light pressure, or some combination.  

At the distance of the Earth from the Sun, the incident power is 1370 MW per square kilometer. This produces about 8 Newtons/square kilometer for high-reflectivity sails.  The attractiveness of solar sails is they use no fuel, and in principle the reflector can be made of local metals in the case of asteroids. The disadvantages are low thrust unless you build them very large, limited angular control, and inverse square dependence of thrust with distance from the source star.   

'''Status:''' As of 2012 a few test flights of sails have been attempted, with varying success.  Any object exposed to sunlight will see a light pressure force, but most spacecraft do not have a low enough mass per area for the force to be more than a minor correction to it's motion.

'''Variations:'''

:'''66a Gravity Tractor''' - In this variation, the sail is not attached to a cargo such as an asteroid you are trying to move.  The mutual gravity of the objects anchors the sail.  Reasons to do this are not having to devise methods to attach the sail, and allowing the sail to maneuver itself with less restrictions.

====67 Laser Lightsail==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' 

'''Type:''' Laser by Photon Deflection

'''Description:''' A high powered laser is aimed at a target sail.  The beam of photons are reflected off the sail material. Reflection of the photons reverses their momentum vectors' component which is normal to the sail. By conservation law, the sail gains momentum. Laser sails can have higher performance than solar sails because the laser beam intensity is not as limited as the local star light, and can be focused over longer distances.  The sail can be designed to optimize reflectivity at the laser wavelength.  This method is still by the overheating of the sail and lack of sufficiently powerful lasers for useful missions.

Advanced interstellar mission concepts have proposed very large phase plate type lenses for long range focus. Another advanced concept is to use two sails to slow down a vehicle, by releasing the first sail and using that to reflect light back to the second, smaller one.

'''Status:''' Not tested as of 2012 mainly due to lack of powerful lasers.  Megawatt class lasers are not powerful in this context.

====68 Microwave Sail==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Starwisp 

'''Type:''' Beamed Microwave by Photon Deflection

'''Description:''' In this method microwaves are reflected off a very thin, open wire mesh. The momentum change of microwave photons bouncing off the mesh provides thrust. Because an open mesh of thin wires can have a very low weight, in theory this propulsion method can give high accelerations. With feasible power levels, the cargo mass will still be small.  A good use for such would be delivering nanofactories, which can then build larger scale infrastructure.  The beam can supply power to operate the factory at the destination.  This is related to the non-transport energy delivery by microwave concept.

'''Status:''' Generating lots of microwave power is well understood.  Keeping it focused over useful distances in space, and building the lightweight sail material are not.

===B. Photon Rockets=== 

This group of methods involve emitting photons from inside the vehicle, rather than reflecting photons from an external source. Like photon reflection, photons do not carry much momentum, so it is a low thrust set of concepts, although the exhaust velocity is the maximum possible.  It can be considered an addition to other propulsion methods by directional emission of radiator waste heat.


====69 Thermal Photon Reflector==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Nuclear Photonic Rocket

'''Type:''' Nuclear Reactor via Photon Emission

'''Description:''' A heat generating device, such as a nuclear reactor, is at the focus of a parabolic reflector. The thermal photons are focused into a near parallel beam, which propels the vehicle. Another high-energy source is a matter-antimatter reaction, which is absorbed by a blanket of heavy metals and converted to heat. This method is probably not practical, since emitting photons gives less momentum than emitting the reaction products of the energy source directly.  It might be worth using directional radiators to get rid of surplus heat in addition to the reaction products.  In that case it increases the total efficiency.

'''Status:''' Not tested as of 2012

'''Variations:'''

====70 Stellar Photon Engine====

'''Alternate Names:''' Stardrive

'''Type:''' Solar Flux by Photon Emission

'''Description:''' This is similar to the previous Thermal Photon Reflector method, except an entire star is at the focus of a cloud of lightsails which are balanced by gravity vs light pressure. Since both gravity and light intensity vary as the inverse square of distance from the star, a specific thickness of sail will be balanced at any distance.  The ratio of the star's luminosity to it's mass will determine the thickness.  The star's spectrum and desired sail distance will determine what to make the sail out of.  By directing the light in one particular direction rather than symmetric in all directions as natural stars do, the sails convert the star into an unbalanced light emitter, and so create a net thrust for the combined star + sail combination.  

Sails with a slight dihedral angle oriented perpendicular to the star will direct the light to miss the star itself, and will be stable in orientation.  Flat sails which do not reflect the light directly back to the star are slightly more efficient since none will be absorbed by the star, but will accelerate themselves sideways.  So that type of sail must change it's orientation periodically to maintain position. Sails which are not flat, such as a shallow cone, can direct the light to miss the star without drifting.

To give a numerical example, a sail at the Earth's distance from the Sun produces about 8 newtons/km^2.  Solar acceleration at that distance is 0.006 m/s^2.  Therefore if your sail  mass is 1330 kg/km^2, light pressure will balance gravity.  If made of aluminum, then it needs to be 0.5 microns thick.  Foils that thick are commercially sold today.  A sail cloud reflecting 10% of the Sun's output will have an area of 28 x 10^15 km^2 and a mass of 37.5 x 10^15 tons (3.7% of the mass of the largest asteroid, 1 Ceres),  Such a sail cloud would produce a thrust of 225 x 10^15 Newtons, and accelerate the Sun by 3.5 meters per second per million years.

Uses for this type of engine are adjusting orbits of binary or multiple star systems, escaping future supernovae, and generally moving stars within a galaxy or between galaxies.  The physics of this method are simple.  The challenge is one of scale, and the extremely slow accelerations it produces because stars are very massive.  Note that moving a star does not generally bring along objects in orbit about the star, they would need their own propulsion.

:'''Moving Planets''' - A more practical (relatively) use for this method is moving planets, because of their much lower mass.  The sails would be anchored by the planet's rather than the star's gravity. A larger secondary cloud of sails would direct more sunlight to the anchored sails than they would collect on their own.  A reason to do this for the Earth is the Sun is increasing it's brightness by 10% per billion years due to increasing fusion rate in the core.  Thus if you want to keep the Earth habitable, you would want to move it slowly outwards.  Alternately, if you wanted to make Venus more habitable, you could move it into the Asteroid belt, where the excess greenhouse effect would be an advantage rather than a detriment.  This would still likely be a slow method.  Using gravity assist maneuvers with large asteroids or outer Solar System bodies would be faster.  Unlike gravity assist for spacecraft, in this case the object doing the flyby is massive enough to affect the orbit of the planet.  If a secondary body such as a gas giant is used to absorb the orbit changes, the flyby object could be used multiple times to shift the small planet without expending too much energy.

'''Status:''' Very far from testing.  Possibly not even used in science fiction stories. 

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:''' 


====71 Gamma Ray Thruster==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' redshift rocket

'''Type:''' Antimatter by Photon Emission

'''Description:''' Gamma rays produced by antimatter annihilation behind a vehicle can be absorbed by a thick layer of heavy metals. The momentum of the gamma ray photons produces thrust. Like other photon engines, it is likely more effective to use the decay particles directly, since they have more mass and can be directed better, but using the gamma rays as a supplement makes sense.

'''Status:''' Currently theoretical, as antimatter is only produced in tiny amounts in particle accelerators.

'''Variations:''' 

'''References:'''


===C. Amplified Photon Pressure===

In this approach, a reflecting cavity is used to multiply the photon pressure.  In one arrangement, a laser emits a particular frequency, and the walls of an enclosing cavity and the vehicle back end are designed to have a high reflectivity for that frequency.  In another arrangement, there is no enclosing cavity, and a laser gain medium is placed in front of one mirror.  The vehicle carries a second mirror, and the pair of mirrors plus gain medium form a laser amplifier which happens to have a large vacuum gap between the energy source and vehicle. In both cases the light will bounce multiple times until finally absorbed or dispersed, each bounce adding a momentum increment.  The wavelength can be adapted to the physical dimensions, for example using microwaves instead of a laser if it creates an efficient reflection.  The multiple reflections will extract energy from the photons as they repeatedly bounce off the moving vehicle by redshift.  If sufficient bounces at sufficient projectile velocity happen, the light would be redshifted to a wavelength not efficiently reflected, or merely lose the majority of their energy, thus ending the momentum transfer.

External interactions are transport methods which create a force  via fields or physical interaction with objects outside the vehicle itself.

==Magnetic Interactions==

====72 Ionospheric Current Engine==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Electrodynamic Engine, Alfven Engine 

'''Type:''' Electrical via Magnetic Field

'''Description:''' A current-carrying wire in a planetary magnetic field will experience an IxB force (current cross product with magnetic field, which is perpendicular to both).  This is the same type of force created in electric motors.  Currents which only flow in one direction cannot be sustained, electric charges would accumulate at one end.  Therefore for this method the current loop is closed through an '''Ionosphere''', the portion of a body's atmosphere which is ionized and can carry a current. The wire accelerates in one direction (pulling a vehicle along), and the ionosphere accelerates in the other direction. The ionosphere motion eventually dissipates within itself. When current is driven through the wire by a power supply, this functions as a motor, generating positive thrust.  When current is allowed to flow in the other direction unopposed, it functions as a generator, producing power which can be used on the vehicle, and creating drag.  Both power and drag can be useful in come circumstances, but any power generated will be at the expense of orbital kinetic energy.

A current loop thruster produces more thrust/watt than an ion or plasma engine. No propellant is consumed directly, although some material is consumed by a '''Plasma Contactor''' to produce a plasma that enables good electrical contact with the ionosphere. Effectively this gives an equivalent exhaust velocity of 250 km/s. Advantages are this is a relatively simple device, and relatively high thrust for an electric thruster.  Limitations of this method are the planet must have both a substantial magnetic field and sufficient ion density to operate effectively, and the direction of thrust is governed by the local magnetic field direction. Planetary magnetic fields are often offset and tilted with respect to their poles, and in any case only point in one direction at any given point in orbit.  The thrust direction is restricted to a circle perpendicular to the field direction.  Earth orbit up to around 1000 km, and some areas around Jupiter are good candidates, other places less so.  Uses include orbit maintenance for low orbit vehicles and Skyhooks, and apogee raising for reaching higher orbits.  This method may be combined with other electric thrusters and share the same power source, changing which thrust method is used as appropriate for altitude or thrust direction. 

The motion of a long wire in a magnetic field will generate a static voltage even when not used for propulsion. Such voltage build-ups happen to all spacecraft, a topic known as '''Spacecraft Charging''', but are much larger with a long conducting wire.  Therefore proper insulation and equipment grounding is needed to avoid damage. Even without the plasma contactor running, spark discharges to the surrounding ionosphere can happen.

'''Status:''' An experiment called the Tethered Satellite System was flown on the Space Shuttle in the 1980's.

==Gravity Interactions==

====73 Gravity Assist==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Planetary Flyby, Celestial Billiards 

'''Type:''' Kinetic Energy by Gravity Field

'''Description:''' Momentum exchange between a planetary body or large satellite and a vehicle allows changing the vehicle's direction and velocity in other reference frames.  When considering just the vehicle and large body, a hyperbolic orbit has the same velocity on approach and departure, but gravity forces change the direction.  When the large body is in turn in orbit around another larger planet or star, the change in vehicle direction can increase or decrease it's velocity relative to the larger velocity.  By conservation of momentum, such gravity assist flybys affect the object you fly past, but typically the vehicle is so much smaller than the body it is flying past, so the change in the body's orbit is too small to measure.

The amount of velocity change is theoretically limited to twice the escape velocity from the body, by changing the vehicle direction 180 degrees.  Thus larger bodies can produce larger velocity changes.  As a practical matter gravity assist usually results in significantly less than this because the vehicle arrives with excess velocity and the desired final direction limits the flyby parameters.  Excess velocity reduces the time the gravity of the body can act.  More typical values are 0.5 to 1.0 times escape velocity measured from 1.5 body radii from it's center.  The velocity changes are still large enough that they are extensively used in planetary exploration missions, often using multiple flybys of different planets, or even the same planet multiple times.  The fuel cost of lining up for a gravity assist in these cases is much lower than doing the equivalent velocity change directly.  The disadvantage is longer mission times consumed by the gravity assists compared to a direct transfer orbit, and needing to select mission dates according to when the planets are in the right positions.  Lunar gravity assist to escape from or return to Earth orbit is particularly useful, as the Moon's orbit is short enough to give frequent opportunities. 

'''Status:''' Used extensively in planetary missions, often multiple times for a single spacecraft. 

'''Variations:'''

====74 Gravity Counterweight==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Dumb-Waiter System 

'''Type:''' Potential Energy by Gravity Field

'''Description:''' In this method mass falling down a gravity well can be an energy source to power payloads going up the gravity well.  Most typically this would be via a space elevator, using the falling mass to directly lift a cargo via cable, or to generate power to lift the cargo electrically. This is most efficient when cargo is going in both directions and are the same mass.  In that case cargo delivery only consumes the inefficiency of the motors, which can be just a few percent.  Another variation is to use braking energy of cargo above synchronous altitude, which sees a centrifugal force higher than gravity, to power lifting cargo from the body surface to synchronous altitude.  The energy for this comes at the expense of rotation of the body by slowing it down.  Braking will induce sideways forces on the elevator.

'''Status:''' Counterweights are commonly used in elevators on Earth.  Space applications have not been tried.

'''Variations:'''

==Aerodynamic Interactions==

Interaction with the atmosphere of large bodies which have one, such as the Earth, can produce significant forces. These forces are distinct from propulsion using an atmosphere which was discussed under '''[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Combustion_Engines Air-Breathing Engines]''', which are principally thrust forces.

====75 Aerodynamic Forces==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Aerobrake, Airfoils

'''Type:''' Kinetic Energy by Aerodynamic Forces

'''Description:''' This method uses aerodynamic interactions with an atmosphere to provide forces perpendicular to forward motion (lift), intentionally oppose forward motion (drag) or change orbit parameters (using lift, with some drag).  Buoyancy, or lift by displacement without forward motion, is covered by method 3 Aerostat. There is a wide range of conditions and applications for aerodynamic forces and it is a well developed field of engineering.

The range of velocities is from well below the local speed of sound, or '''Subsonic''', to many times the speed of sound, or '''Hypersonic''', even beyond escape velocities.  All bodies which are not symmetric or pointing directly parallel with the velocity direction will generate some lift, and all moving bodies generate drag.  The ratio of lift to drag, known as '''L/D Ratio''' ranges from less than 1.0 for blunt re-entry bodies to 25 or more for good subsonic '''Airfoil''' shapes designed to maximize lift. Structures whose main purpose is to generate lift are called '''Wings'''.  All lifting bodies induce some drag by virtue of the lift force not being entirely perpendicular, as well as body drag from other parts of the vehicle besides the wings.

Lift forces can be used to gain altitude as part of a climb to orbit.  Drag forces would be minimized as they counteract thrust to reach orbital velocity.  On return from orbit, purposely designed devices to slow down include parachutes, heat shields, and High Q Aerobrakes.  While already in orbit, pure drag generating Low Q aerobraking can be done without special devices as long as the drag and heating are within what the structure can withstand.  Orbital speed lift devices can change orbit direction, at the cost of some drag loss.

'''Status:''' Powered aircraft have operated for over 100 years.  Jet aircraft have been used as the carriers for rockets. They use a combination of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Combustion_Engines#25_Fanjet 25 Fanjet] for forward thrust and wings for lift.

'''Variations:'''

:* '''75a Parachute''' - Relatively low Mach number drag device to come to a complete stop or low enough velocity for a terminal landing device.
:* '''75b High Q Aerobrake''' - Q is dynamic pressure, the pressure caused by motion through an atmosphere.  High Q aerobrakes generate a lot of drag at high Mach numbers. They are often designed as inflatable devices, called '''Ballutes''' (from balloon and parachute), but extendable flaps or panels would also fall into this category.
:* '''75c Heat Shields''' - They are drag devices integrated into a vehicle structure, but primarily designed to dissipate the extreme heat of re-entry.
:* '''75d Low Q Aerobrake''' - These are often re-purposed existing parts of a vehicle which are used for braking.  By keeping the braking drag low, and using multiple orbits, often the braking can be done without special components on the spacecraft.  Obviously that will take longer.

'''References:'''

==Mechanical Interactions==

This category involves direct physical contact with a natural or human-made body in space. 

====76 Rheobrake==== 

'''Alternate Names:''' Lithobrake, Crashportation 

'''Type:''' Lower Kinetic Energy by Friction

'''Description:''' This methods uses mechanical friction against a planetary surface to slow down. For example, imagine a rail made of cast basalt on the lunar surface. It is laid level to the ground, and is shaped like the concrete highway dividers. A vehicle wanting to land is in a low grazing orbit. It aligns with the rail, just above it, then extends some clamps over the rail. By applying clamping pressure, the vehicle can brake from lunar orbit to a stop. Obviously the brake will be dissipating a lot of heat, and will therefore have to be made of high temperature material such as graphite.  Another approach is to have a 'runway' which is a smoothed area on the lunar surface. The arriving vehicle slows down to below orbital speed, then gravity pulls it down to the runway, and friction with skids on the bottom of the vehicle slows it down.

In order to not melt the brake, it should maximize surface area and possibly have cooling systems like heat pipes.  The rail will not see such concentrated heating, so cooling is not as much of a challenge.  The main advantage is not requiring fuel to land on a body.  The main disadvantage is the large size and mechanical accuracy required for the landing rail or runway. When the velocity is greater than the speed of sound in the brake materials, irregularities in the landing surface can create shock waves in the device. This method is easier to implement on smaller bodies where the amount of orbital kinetic energy to dissipate is less.

'''Status:''' Mechanical brakes are used in many vehicles on Earth.  High performance ones are used in passenger aircraft.  Use for space transport is theoretical at this point.

'''Variations:''' 

:* '''76a Rock Cloud''' - This involves creating an artificial 'atmosphere' of particles to slow down against. A cloud of lunar dust could be raised by electrostatic forces and an arriving vehicle slows by impact of the dust particles, or deflection by charged surfaces on the vehicle.

'''References:'''

====76a Space Harpoon====

'''Description:''' In 2015, [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/comet-hitchhiker-would-take-tour-of-small-bodies NASA proposed] using a harpoon and cable to hook to a passing object, and use braking of the cable to accelerate and match velocity.  Redeploying the cable and using the objects spin to sling the vehicle would add additional velocity.

{{TOC right}}

Transport methods can be sorted by performance, status, and cost measures. The following sections describe the measures and make a first attempt to rank the various methods.  Technology is constantly progressing, so any selection of methods needs to be updated with the most current data, or projections for future planning purposes.

==Comparisons Among Methods==

===Performance Measures===

====Exhaust Velocity====

Any propulsion method that expels matter or energy to produce thrust obeys conservation of momentum, which is defined as mass times velocity.  The exhaust momentum is equal to and opposite change in vehicle momentum.  Given a finite supply of materials for the exhaust, mass is fixed.  Therefore higher velocity leads to higher total momentum, and thus better performance for the vehicle.  Exhaust velocity is measured in meters/second.  Some systems, like 72 Ionospheric Current Engine, do not use exhaust for momentum exchange, but have a consumed supply - plasma generated for contact to the ionosphere in this case. The '''effective exhaust velocity''' is then calculated from the thrust force and mass flow rate.

====Specific Impulse====

Specific impulse is a derived measure traditionally used for launch from Earth, and then extended to space.  It is defined as pounds thrust per pounds/second of fuel consumed, which simplifies to units of seconds.  When multiplied by one Earth gravity (9.80665 m/s^2) it converts to exhaust velocity, which is the preferred measure since it is in SI units.

====Acceleration====

====Thrust to Weight Ratio====
 
 
===Status Measures===

====Technical Maturity====

====Implentation Status====
 
 
===Cost Measures===

====Development Cost====

====Production Cost====

====Operating Cost====

==Transport Optimization==

'''Optimizing Vehicles'''

In past rockets, this has been done by using different type of fuel for different stages in a rocket. In the early part of the flight, air drag is important, so a dense fuel is preferred. A dense fuel means smaller fuel tanks, and hence less area to create drag. Thus the Saturn V used liquid oxygen/kerosene and the Shuttle uses solid rockets for the first stage, both being dense fuels. Both use liquid oxygen/ liquid hydrogen for the second stage. This has the highest performance in use for a chemical rocket fuel. 

The Pegasus rocket uses an aircraft to get above the bulk of the atmosphere. A sub-sonic jet engine has about ten times the performance of a chemical rocket, mostly because it does not have to carry oxygen to burn. 

Many, many propulsion combinations are possible in getting to Earth orbit and beyond. A large part of space propulsion design is choosing which methods to use and when to switch from one to another.

{{TOC right}}

A system designer should know the current state of knowledge in topics relevant to their work. There are several reasons.  One is to not repeat work already done by someone else. Another is to stimulate new ideas and improvements. In addition to the references listed below and elsewhere in the book, it is very useful to know how to find additional information.  Categories of information include:

* Current News (Magazines, Newspapers, Blogs)
* Archival Publications (Journals, Preprint Archives)
* Books 
* Online Data (Web and other protocols)
* Technical Reports
* Product Data
* Discussion Forums

Once information is located you should record where and how you found it, to save having to find it again.  There are a number of ways to do that, depending on type of media: building a personal library in paper or electronic form, bookmarking in web browsers, etc.  As long as you have the ability to find the data again, the particular methods can be left to personal preference.


==Current News==

As of 2012, obtaining current news via paper-based sources is nearly obsolete.  Internet-based electronic delivery is faster and less expensive.  There are innumerable online websites, magazines, and blogs covering every topic relevant to space systems.  One distinction between sites is original reporting vs re-posting of news from elsewhere.  You should also consider the quality and experience of the writers and any bias they might have.  We cannot list all possible news sources, and any such list would rapidly become obsolete.  Therefore we will list a few good examples and encourage looking for good sources in your fields of interest.


'''General News'''

* '''[http://news.google.com/ Google News]''' - General news aggregator.  This means they do not write original stories, but rather link to stories from multiple other sources. Searchable and customizable, it is a good starting point to find other regular sources. Story selection for the front page is automated, but the full database indexes several thousand news sites.
* '''Reddit [http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/ Technology], [http://www.reddit.com/r/science/ Science], and [http://www.reddit.com/r/space/ Space] Topics''' - Reader submitted daily links divided by topic, with active discussions.  There are many topic headings, but the three listed are the largest related to space.  It is another news aggregator, but human-submitted and filtered by votes of the readers.


'''General Space'''

* '''[http://www.space.com/ Space.com]''' - General news website for anything related to space.


'''General Technology'''

* '''[http://nextbigfuture.com/ Next Big Future]''' - Blog for all kinds of new and future science and technology.  Often covers space topics.


'''General Science'''

* '''[http://www.eurekalert.org/pubnews.php?view=titles EurekAlert]''' - Current science and technology press releases. Often a day earlier and unmodified by journalists.


'''Specific Industries'''

* '''[http://www.aviationweek.com/HomePage.aspx Aviation Week]''' - Aerospace industry news, including space projects.
* '''[http://www.automationworld.com/ Automation World]''' - Manufacturing automation.
* '''[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/latest-news EE TImes]''' - Electronics engineering. This link is to the news summary.


==Multiple Documents==

The following sites index, search, or link to multiple documents:

====Library Indexes====

Two steps in finding the current state of knowledge are (1) finding what works exist on a given topic, and (2) locating a copy of the work to look at.  Library indexes help with both steps.

* '''[http://catalog.loc.gov/webvoy.htm Library of Congress Online Catalog]''' - This is an index to the largest single library in the world, including books and periodicals.  Basic search is by title, author, and subject.  Items are shelved and indexed by subject, using a cataloging '''Call Number''' system. If you use the &quot;Call Number Browse&quot; type of search, you can look through all the entries under that subject, which is useful for doing general research on a subject.  The '''[http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/ LC Classification Outline]''' has a summary of the call number system.  For space projects, the headings Q (Science) and T (Technology) are the most relevant, although other sections can be useful depending on the topic.

* '''[http://www.worldcat.org/ WorldCat]''' - This is an online database of the collections of over 10,000 libraries worldwide.  If a work is not available nearby or online, a process of '''Inter-Library Loan''' can be used from a local library to borrow it from another library.

====Online Search====

In addition to well-known search engines such as '''[http://www.google.com/ Google]''' and '''[http://www.bing.com/ Bing]''', there are more specialized searches such as:

* '''[http://scholar.google.com/ Google Scholar]''' - for searching scholarly works
* '''[http://books.google.com/ Google Books]''' - for searching the text of books in general
* '''[http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Search_Engines/Specialized/ Open Directory Specialized Search Engine List]''' - Links to many other search websites.

====Online Repositories====

Repositories contain multiple online documents which usually can be downloaded.  In some cases they only index the document online and you then have to request or find a physical copy.

* '''[http://www.mediafire.com/?y1ko8gj5rouob Rocket Science Library]''' - A collection of open source, public domain, and online works compiled in parallel with the development of this book.  A list of additional works is included for ones where copyright restrictions prevent including the document itself.

* '''[http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp NASA Technical Reports Server]''' - Access to approximately 1 million documents in NASA databases.
* '''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/ Defense Technical Information Center]''' - Public access to the unrestricted subset of approximately 2 million US DOD and other technical documents.
* '''[http://patft.uspto.gov/ US Patent and Trademark Office]''' - Search and download patent data.  Patents often contain very useful technical data.
* '''[http://arxiv.org/ arXiv.org]''' - Open access to over 750,000 electronic papers in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance and Statistics. Operated by Cornell University Library.
* '''[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFullText/ NATO Research and Technology]''' - FTP server of NATO technical and conference reports. Some have relevance to space projects.  It is recommended to find titles and document numbers by other search methods, since the ones here are stored only by their document numbers.
* '''[http://www.nss.org/settlement/index.html National Space Society Library]''' - Online library with multiple space references.
* '''[https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx Defense Acquisition University ACC Practice Center]''' - Multiple documents about how the US government manages projects, including engineering methods in general, and space projects as a topic.

==Discussion Forums==

Although online forums are informal, the collective knowledge of the participants is sometimes impressive.  The discussion history can be searched or new questions asked to make use of it.

=='''Population Served'''==
==='''Grades and Ages'''===
The King George School served students from grades 9-12.

===Special Characteristics of Students===
King George School served students with a history of at-risk behaviors, but with a some willingness to work with the problems and attempt to address them.  Many students entered King George School after completing a wilderness program, more restrictive therapeutic or emotional growth school or other more intense intervention. Others arrived at the school directly from home.  

All students needed to be academically capable, as academic standards were comparable to many conventional boarding schools.

=='''Size of School'''==

In May 2010, King George School had a student body of about 35.  It later closed.

=='''Description of Physical Plant'''==
King George School is on the grounds of the former King George Farm.  It is a few miles from the rural village of Sutton, and about 25 miles north of St. Johnsbury, USA.  If you drive to the campus, you will leave the paved road then continue a mile or two on gravel.  As you approach the King George property, you will see the main classroom building on your left and the administration building on the right.  

The classroom building includes a dance studio, a theater and an art studio, in addition to an adequate array of classrooms.  This building was designed to blend with the ubiquitous white frame buildings so common in northern New England.  

Across the road is the building that houses the office of the head of school, admission and financial services.  Behind the administration building is a photo lab and darkroom, and a small barn that houses various unexpected projects.  

Just beyond the classroom building is the boys' dormitory. Rooms are designed for about four boys per room. Design is simple, practical and clean.  The girl's dorms are located down the road with the Horse Barn, a refurbished barn, that has become a very comfortable place for assemblies, meetings and recreation. Nearby is a small chapel, strongly resembling an old Quaker meeting house.

The campus goes together to form an integrated whole, that is comfortable, secluded, peaceful, practical, and very attractive.

=='''Special Programs'''==
King George School is proud of its academic college preparatory curriculum, supplemented by available qualified therapists, licensed in the state of Vermont. The King George School is a recognized independent school by the Vermont Department of Education and is a member of the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs.  

It is also well known for its diverse visual and performing arts program. 

The best descriptions of these programs are on King George School's own web site. Please click on links above.

=='''School History'''==

=='''Athletics'''==

=='''Extra-Curricular Activities other than Athletics'''==
The student life program at the King George School provides students with many opportunities to enjoy activities both on and off campus.   Activities include (but are not limited to) mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, hiking, swimming, rock and ice climbing, rock band, weightlifting, drama, local concerts and lectures, and more.

=='''Ownership'''==
[http://www.uhsinc.com/index_uhs.php Universal Health Services] acquired King George School in August 2005, along with a several of the other former Cedu/Brown schools.  Some of the previous acquisitions by Universal use the name &quot;school&quot; but are licensed as treatment facilities (for example, [http://www.provocanyon.com/ Provo Canyon School.)]
The mission of the school quietly changed to that of a treatment center.  Enrollment declined, and the former school eventually closed.

=='''General Description of School'''==

King George School was a private, college-preparatory therapeutic boarding school for grades 9-12.  It was a fine academic institution during its early years, with a strong visual and performing arts program to encourage student self expression and self discloure. 

The school suffered during the later days of operating as one of the Brown Schools/Cedu Schools during the time the Brown Schools were in decline, culminating in bankruptcy in April 2005. The school continued operating during the bankruptcy period. In August 2005, the school and most other Brown Schools properties were acquired by [http://www.uhsinc.com/index_uhs.php Universal Health Services]. After that change of ownership, the school continued its decline, and eventually closed.

      <comment>/* CELX Scripting */  Rewrote to clarify difference between CEL and CELX scripting.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==CELX Scripting==

CELX scripts can be used to interact with the user, change Celestia's viewpoint and what it shows, and do sophisticated calculations.

CELX first appeared in Celestia v1.3.1. CELX consists of the [http://www.lua.org/ Lua]-programming language combined with a Celestia-specific API. That is, CELX uses Lua syntax and most of the basic Lua-libraries, and adds Celestia-specific functionality.

CELX's biggest advantage over CEL scripting is that it is a real programming language, including control structures like functions and loops, and offers a lot more possibilities, such as interactivity. However this power also makes CELX harder to learn and use, and provides the main disadvantage over CEL scripting.

A few [http://celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net/celestia/celestia/scripts/ example Lua scripts] for Celestia are available on SourceForge.

      <comment>/* Writing Celestia Script Commands */ typo</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== CEL scripting ==

CEL scripts are short text-based programs that Celestia can read. They contain simple commands that take control of Celestia (once it is launched) and enable a script writer to design a specific journey or set of scenes that a user of the script will see and experience. For example, a script may take the user on a short tour of the solar system, pausing briefly at all of the planets. In that way, a CEL script is used to change the position of Celestia's viewpoint.

CEL scripting is basically a sequence of commands similar to key-presses, which are executed in specific timing and at a particular speed to give viewers a visual experience that the script writer wants to display. There is however no interactivity with the user during the execution of a CEL script.


Scripts can take users to very specific locations in the Celestia universe. For example, a script can be written to take them into orbit around Venus, or take them outside the Milky Way to view it from intergalactic space. What happens when they get there is controlled by the script as well. There may be a 30 second pause, followed by a movement to another location. There may also be text displayed, to teach the user some information about a particular place.

Scripts also have the ability to change specific Celestia (render) settings. For example the rendering of orbits can be turned on/off or planets can be given a marker or alternative surface texture. Note however, when a CEL script ends or is terminated by the user, there is NO ability to reset those settings to the values they were before running the script. It is advised for the user to have their own '''reset.cel''' script, so specific Celestia (render) settings can be easily restored after running other CEL scripts.


A script can be launched from the '''Celestia/File/Open script...''' or '''Celestia/File/scripts''' drop down menu and it will run until it is complete. Meanwhile it can be paused by the user by pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key or it can be stopped at any time by pressing the ['''Esc'''] key.&lt;br&gt;When the file extension &quot;'''.cel'''&quot; of a script is also correctly associated with the Celestia program, it is also possible to launch the script externally, e.g. from a hyperlink or by double clicking.


Scripts offer a Celestia user several key advantages:
# A Celestia script writer can give inexperienced users a beautiful visual tour of a particular Celestia environment.
# Important celestial events can be displayed for a user, controlled by script. For example, a script can take a user to 1957 to see Sputnik 1 orbiting Earth on its maiden flight. The script can put the viewer into a position just 10 meters from Sputnik, and pace it as it flies over the Soviet Union, then display a paragraph of text explaining the significance of Sputnik.
# If no script were available, it might take a user many minutes to set up Celestia to go to the same spot at the same time. Also, no text would be displayed.
# In the special Celestia-ED version of the Celestia program, CEL scripts have been given the ability to also command sound and music files to play. As such, scripts can be designed which choreograph complex movements of planets or spacecraft, while moving to music.


=== Writing Celestia Script Commands ===

Anyone can write a CEL script. Some knowledge of how to do so is required and is summarized below, but you do not have to be a very experienced Celestia user to write a CEL script.

The very first character in a CEL script must be an opening curly brace &quot;'''{'''&quot;. The very last character in a script must be a closing curly brace &quot;'''}'''&quot;.

Therefore, an empty, but valid Celestia CEL script file looks like the following:

 { }

Every script you create for Celestia will have at least one command line in it, which is a line of text instructing Celestia to set or do something.

A typical single Celestia script command line consists of the following pieces:
* A command name, such as '''wait'''
* A space (spacebar)
* An opening curly brace &quot;'''{'''&quot;
* Zero or more &lt;u&gt;argument names&lt;/u&gt;, along with the &lt;u&gt;value&lt;/u&gt; you want the argument set to.
* A closing curly brace &quot;'''}'''&quot;

The &quot;#&quot; character can be used as the first character in a script line to make that line a comment line, which the script engine will ignore (not execute).


'''Examples:'''

Assign a &lt;''number''&gt; value of 5.5, to the argument '''duration''', in the command '''wait''', which tells Celestia to pause for the number of seconds you enter.

'''Note:''' there are no double quote marks (&quot;) around the &lt;''number''&gt; value (5.5) because double quote marks are used only to specify a &lt;''string''&gt; value.

 wait { duration 5.5 }

Assign a &lt;''string''&gt; value of &quot;Mars&quot;, to the argument '''object''', in the '''select''' command:

'''Note:''' Here, double quote marks tell Celestia that a &lt;''string''&gt;, or text value (Mars), is being sent to it. When sending a &lt;''string''&gt; to Celestia, the value &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; be enclosed in double quote marks.

 select { object &quot;Mars&quot; }

Example of a comment line.

 # This is a comment line

Some Celestia CEL script commands, such as '''print''', send more than one argument. In these cases, you enclose all arguments and their associated values between the command's opening and closing curly braces, such as:

'''Note:''' All arguments for each command must be enclosed within the command's curly braces, such as the example above shows. You may include as much white space (spaces, blank lines, etc.) as you deem necessary, and you may even specify each argument and its associated value on a different line – all for clarity.

 print { text &quot;Hello universe.&quot;  row -4  column 1  duration 5 }

-- OR --

 print { text &quot;Hello universe.&quot;
         row -4
         column 1
         duration 5 }

When you save a Celestia CEL script file to disk, the file extension must be &quot;'''.cel'''&quot;, which allows your operating system to recognize the file as belonging to Celestia, and allows Celestia to know this file is one of its CEL scripts. Also, you must save the file as '''plain text'''. Rich Text Format files do not function in Celestia because they also contain embedded formatting information.

=== Index of available CEL commands  ===

An index of the available CEL commands can be found at the '''[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#CEL_command_index|CEL command index]]''' section of the CEL to CELX migration chapter.

By clicking on a specific command, you will be routed to the explanation of its functionality. The index also contains an explanation on how that CEL command can be migrated to equivalent CELX objects and methods. Before starting with CELX scripting however, you may need to have some programming experience with CEL scripting first.

=== CEL scripting versus CELX scripting ===

A main advantage of CEL scripting is that it's MUCH easier to use than CELX scripting. The syntax is easy due to the simple structure of the commands, and most of the time it's very easy to translate keyboard commands directly into their CEL counterparts.

The primary disadvantage in using CEL-scripting versus CELX-scripting is its limited flexibility, its inability to respond to keyboard commands, the absence of a possibility to reset changed user settings to the values they were before running the CEL script and a lack of support for many of the '''new''' Celestia features that appeared in Celestia version {{Celx:v160}} and newer Celestia versions/releases.


The main differences between CEL scripting and CELX scripting are summarized below:
* The extension of CEL and CELX scripts differ from each other:
** CEL script: .CEL
** CELX script: .CELX
* More words and more commands make CELX scripts look more complex than CEL scripts, but it also gives your scripts more possibilities, including the usage of Lua logic (like building loops, make decisions on what to do, calculations, etc.), and interactive keyboard input.&lt;br&gt;The [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#CEL_to_CELX_migration|CEL to CELX migration]] section will help you with the more complex CELX equivalents of the CEL commands, so you can use these equivalents in your own script. Besides the equivalents, there are also examples included. You can copy the equivalents into your own script and modify them according your own wishes. After a while you’ll become more familiar with CELX scripting and copying or typing a sequence of CELX methods and objects will become easier each time.
* Keyboard interaction is possible in CELX, but not in CEL scripting. Within CELX you can use the callback for keyboard input, which must have the name [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#Keyboard|'''celestia_keyboard_callback]]. After a script activates the handling keyboard-input by calling [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#requestkeyboard|celestia:requestkeyboard(true)]], any keypress will result in a call to a method with this name.
* Angles in CELX are defined in radians instead of degrees in CEL.&lt;br&gt;180 degrees (half a circle) is the same as π radians = 3.14159265 radians.&lt;br&gt;You can use the Lua '''math.rad()''' and '''math.deg()''' functions to convert degrees to radians and [i]vice versa[/i]:
** radians = '''math.rad'''( &lt;''number:degrees''&gt; )
** or you can convert yourself: radians = ( &lt;''number:degrees''&gt; / 180 * 3.14159265)
** or use Lua '''math.pi''': radians = ( &lt;''number:degrees''&gt; / 180 * '''math.pi''')
** degrees = '''math.deg'''( &lt;''number:radians''&gt; )
** or you can convert yourself: degrees = ( &lt;''number:radians''&gt; * 180 / 3.14159265)
** or use Lua '''math.pi''': degrees = ( &lt;''number:radians''&gt; * 180 / '''math.pi''')
* The units of the components of a position object in CELX are millionths of a light-year. When you have position components defined in km (CEL scripting) or miles, you first have to convert those components to millionths of a light year.&lt;br&gt;Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your CELX script:
** From km to millionths of a light year, use constant: uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808. 
** From miles to millionths of a light year, use constant: uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630. 
* Next you can convert km or miles to millionths of a light year as follows:
** millionths_of_a_light_year = &lt;''number:km''&gt; / uly_to_km
** millionths_of_a_light_year = &lt;''number:miles''&gt; / uly_to_mls
* Be aware that some default parameter values have changed in CELX compared with the equivalent defaults in CEL scripting.
* Time in CELX is defined in TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) instead of UTC or Juliandate, because UTC includes &quot;leap seconds&quot; in order to stay aligned with the Earth's varying rotation. Leap seconds happen essentially randomly, when they are needed. Although Celestia does incorporate a table of leap second times, the use of UTC in versions of Celestia before v1.5.0 caused problems when used with ephemerides which are defined using TDB.&lt;br&gt;Starting with version {{Celx:v150}}, although it still displays UTC on the screen, Celestia uses the TDB time scale internally for everything else. As a result, Celestia places objects much more accurately than before.
** To convert from Juliandate and/or UTC to TDB is explained in the section: [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods/CEL_command_time|CEL: time]].
* Transparency of markers can be '''true''' or '''false''' in CELX (starting from Celestia version {{Celx:v160}}). In CEL scripting there’s no possibility to enable or disable the transparency of markers. The Celestia releases {{Celx:v150}}/1.5.1 and older always displayed the markers, but from Celestia version {{Celx:v160}} (or Celestia-ED version 1.5.1), the default marker transparency is '''true''', resulting in disappearing markers in case of Occultations, or partially show markers on the surface of celestial objects. To overcome this, the usage of the '''false''' parameter in the CELX: [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#mark|object:mark()]] method is necessary, which also makes CELX scripting necessary, instead of CEL scripting!
* Sometimes, timing can be more sensitive in CELX scripting than it is in CEL scripting, especially when lots of Lua commands and Celestia (related) methods are used within a short period of time with a high timerate value ([i]i.e.[/i] when time has been speeded up). Solving those timing issues on your own computer may not always give the same result on other computers with different CPU speeds. In those cases, the usage of a CEL equivalent part within your CELX script may give a more consistent result.
* It is possible to insert CEL script parts within a CELX script by defining the following function at the beginning of your CELX script:

 function CEL(source) 
    local script = celestia:createcelscript(source) 
    while script:tick() do 
       wait(0) 
    end 
 end
 
 -- Within the subsequent part of your CELX script you can now use CEL script commands as follows:
 CEL([[{ &lt;''one or more lines with CEL script commands''&gt; }]])

* CEL and CELX Scripts can be temporarily paused, by pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key. Pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key again will result in the continuation of the script.&lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' When using CEL script parts and functions &lt;u&gt;within&lt;/u&gt; a CELX script, this pause function will not work completely correctly. Although the scene you’re looking at will pause directly, the CEL script parts and functions will continue to run in the background, resulting in a part of the script being visually skipped when you press the ['''Spacebar'''] key again to continue the script.

== Test Scripts and Questions ==

Using the very first, very simple CELX example script here, to wit:

celestia:flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The &quot;flash&quot; function is defined within the object &quot;Celestia.&quot;
When this script is executed, I expected it to do nothing more than
display the text &quot;Hello Universe!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Prior to executing this script, I had centered the Earth in my 
Celestia window, and I was in the &quot;Follow&quot; mode. When I execute this
script, the viewpoint changes so that the Earth gets moved to one
side or the other prior to seeing the &quot;Hello Universe!&quot; message.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Am I correct in thinking that this movement is caused by Celestia's
definition of the &quot;flash&quot; function? In other words, the &quot;flash&quot; 
function in Celestia itself probably includes some movement function
to be executed. Yes?&lt;br&gt;

:No. I don't see the earth move when I try this. How are you running the script?
&lt;br&gt;


After investigating the properties of the &quot;flash&quot; and &quot;print&quot; functions 
in Celestia, I tried the following script to center the message on my
display. This also causes movement of the Earth, even though I thought
I centered everything on the screen since I'm using 0 (zero) in the 
parameters list. Can anyone explain what's going on here?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
celestia:print(&quot;Hello Universe!&quot;, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0)&lt;br&gt;
wait (5)&lt;br&gt;

:I don't see this either. May be same problem as above.

:Mystery explained... Open Scripts dialog and I double-clicked on the celx script in order to open it. If I simply use the dialogs provided by Celestia to open the script, the movement does not occur. Thanks.
:In other words, do NOT double-click on the file name. Simply click on the OPEN dialog box.
:One other note... If I do this using a CEL script, there is no apparent effect on the CEL script.

How do I execute celx scripts on Debian GNU/Linux (celestia 1.6.1)? I attempt with $ celestia --url test.celx and I greeted with invalid option -- '-'

:Celestia on linux currently does not support the --url parameter. Celx scripts can be executed with the parameter &quot;-f /path/to/script.celx&quot;. Note the script path must be the fully explicit path and not the relative path. See debian [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=682258 bug #682258]

=== Test script from the BrainDead ===

   flashRadius = function (bodyName)
   body = celestia:find(bodyName) -- finds object 
   radius = body:radius() -- gets radius
   celestia:flash(&quot;The radius of &quot; .. body:name() .. &quot; is &quot; .. radius .. &quot; km.&quot;)
   wait(2.0)
   end
      
   flashRadius(&quot;Mercury&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Venus&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Earth&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Mars&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Jupiter&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Saturn&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Uranus&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Neptune&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Pluto&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Charon&quot;)
 
   function flash(message)
   celestia:flash(message)
   wait(2.0)
   end
 
   message = &quot;End of this test script&quot;
   flash = celestia:flash(message,5)

:Important point in the above... The variable &quot;message&quot; must be defined prior
:to execution of the &quot;flash&quot; function or the script causes an error which says
:that it expected a string. This makes sense. Still learning here.

:I'm really '''confused''' by this though. How is it that this script shows the
:text &quot;End of this test script&quot; if the flash function has been defined,
:but it has NOT been called? In other words, why don't I need a line
:which calls the function? i.e. - flash(message)

::You didn't call &quot;flash&quot;, but you did call &quot;celestia:flash&quot;. The statement: 
&lt;tt&gt;
   flash = celestia:flash(message,5)
&lt;/tt&gt;

::calls the &quot;flash&quot; method of the &quot;celestia&quot; object (that's what the right side of the assignment says to do) and then assigns the result (nil) to the variable &quot;flash&quot;, redefining it. Probably not what you wanted. You only do an assignment to the &quot;flash&quot; variable when you define the function. Remember that:

&lt;tt&gt;
   function flash(message)
   celestia:flash(message)
   wait(2.0)
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;
::is equivalent to:
&lt;tt&gt;
 flash =  function (message)
   celestia:flash(message)
   wait(2.0)
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;

::The function name &quot;flash&quot; is just another variable. [[User:HankR|HankR]] 17:59, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

::Okay, I think I understand what you mean. Appreciate the help.--[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]] 22:45, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

===Another test script ===

   camera = celestia:getobserver()
   tethys = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Saturn/Tethys&quot;) -- finds object named Tethys.
   celestia:select(tethys) 
   camera:center(tethys,5)
   wait(5)
   camera:follow(tethys)
   cameraPosition = camera:getposition() -- gets position of observer.
   tethysPosition = tethys:getposition() -- gets position of Tethys.
   distance = tethysPosition:distanceto(cameraPosition) -- gets distance from position of Tethys to observer.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..distance.. &quot; km&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Let's have a look...&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   obs=celestia:getobserver()
   obs:gotodistance(tethys,10000,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Here it is!&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   newPosition = obs:getposition() -- gets NEW position of the observer.
   newdistance = tethysPosition:distanceto(newPosition) -- gets distance from position of Tethys to new observer position.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..newdistance.. &quot; km&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
:Okay, this works, but I have questions again... First, thanks to Malenfant for the idea here.
:How do I round the values presented by tethysPosition and newdistance?
:: Use &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;,newdistance)..&quot; km&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
:Why does the newdistance value not show either 10000km or the value shown on Celestia's display?
::Celestia's display shows the distance to the surface, you calculated the distance center to center. Plus, Tethys has moved since the time when you got its position. You calculated the distance to its old position, not its current position. You need to get the position again. Anytime you call wait(), time will pass and things will move. [[User:HankR|HankR]] 03:31, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
:I'm still trying here. --[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]]
:Thanks again for the help, Hank. I understand this one now.--[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]] 10:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

=== Corrected Script ===
   myobject = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Saturn/Tethys&quot;) -- finds object named Tethys.
   celestia:select(myobject) 
   celestia:center(myobject,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:follow(myobject)
   camera = celestia:getobserver()
   cameraPosition = camera:getposition() -- gets position of observer.
   tethysPosition = myobject:getposition() -- gets position of Tethys.
   distance = tethysPosition:distanceto(cameraPosition) -- gets distance from  position of Tethys to observer.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;,distance)..&quot; km&quot;,5)

:This revision of the script corrects the errors I had earlier, and it reflects an integer value.
:Can I ask though, HOW you knew about the integer correction? I can find that &lt;b&gt;nowhere&lt;/b&gt; in any of
:the documentation I have.

::It's in the Lua 5.0 reference manual.

:Where did you find &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;)..&quot; and can I display, say two decimal places? Perhaps
:using something like &quot;..string.format(&quot;%2&quot;)???? --[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]] 00:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::&lt;tt&gt;string.format&lt;/tt&gt; uses a C-style ouput format control string. Use &quot;%.2f&quot; for two decimal places.

:PS - Am I okay with the format here? Should I NOT post so much script? Should I use different
:headers? Sorry, just me... Confused ol' Bob

::It might be helpful if this material were reformatted as a FAQ page for CELX. Put each question in a separate section with the question as the section title. This would make it more useful for others.[[User:HankR|HankR]] 01:05, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Kokonutz. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Kokonutz~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:20, 17 March 2015 (UTC)
&lt;!-- SUL finalisation notification --&gt;

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first step in most watch restoration is to remove the movement.  You'll need to do this for clean and lube, and it is recommended for crystal polishing, especially for non-water-resistant watches.  (The last thing you want inside your watch is abrasive polish)

1. For most watches, remove the back.  Screw-backs need a special tool to remove without a strong chance of damage--Luckily Indian &quot;Jaxa-Type&quot; removers are inexpensive.  Pick the proper tips--Most watches have notches, for those use the small rectangular tips.  Holes use the round tips, flats use the wedge-shaped tips with a broad flat spot. The remaining tips are &quot;Rolex style&quot;.  Don't use these unless you want to gouge the case back, you need the round Rolex rings to actually remove these backs.  

Adjust the top tips to fit the wrench areas.  For 6 holes or notches, adjust the top tips to fit 2 notches with 1 between.  For flats, you need to pick a pair of flats about 1/3 of the circumference apart, but selected so the bottom tip hits a flat and not a point.  The upper tips should be adjusted slightly small, they will spread when you tighten the bottom.  

Adjust the bottom pin to fit its slot, and tighten slightly.  Tighten more for flats.  

Twist the tool counterclockwise.  

For stubborn cases, (which includes most flats) you may need to support the case in a case clamp, and maybe support the case clamp in a sturdy vise, so you can apply downward pressure while turning.  You may also want to use penetrating oil around the case as a last resort.  

The other common type of watch is the snap-on. A watchmaker's case knife is best, but any sturdy or slightly sharp knife will do.  Most watches have a slight wide spot to fit the knife in.  Use the knife as a wedge rather than prying.  

Once the back is off, there's usually a movement ring that just lifts out.  

A few watches are &quot;remove through crystal&quot;, with either a one-piece case or a glued caseback.  See [[../Removing and replacing crystals/]]. 


There's an extra complication on some of these, you need to remove the stem before you can get to the usual stem release.  Some will have a two-piece stem.  Most two-piece have a snap fit, just pull the crown hard and even--You may want to wedge sturdy tweezers between crown and case and wiggle them off. Other two-piece stems slide apart when the slot is aligned properly--For these you might be able to see between the dial and case to get the stem slot lined up, otherwise hold the watch upside down so that if the movement comes free it will fall into your palm.  Jiggle the case while slowly turning the crown.  Plastic cases may have a plug at the back to access the standard stem release.  Finally, some Timex one-piece cases need a special wrench to hold a flat spot on the stem while unscrewing the crown.  This wrench can be made by filing a flat screwdriver or piece of brass.  



Once the back is off, you will probably need to remove the stem--A few have a slot for the stem rather than a tube, these will allow the movement to lift out immediately.  

If it is necessary to remove the stem, most watches release best when the stem is in the set position.  Mechanical watches will usually have a button or screw near the stem.  Push the button while wiggling the stem free, or loosen the screw about 1 1/2 turns, then wiggle the stem.  If the stem won't come loose, slowly loosen the screw while wiggling the stem--You want to avoid completely unscrewing the screw, or you will have to remove the dial and replace the set lever. 

Quartz watches will usually have a push area, but it can be hard to find.  Sometimes it will be marked &quot;push here&quot; other times you have to experiment.  

At this point the movement should be free to fall out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protozoa (greek, protos-first, zoon-animal) are single-celled (unicellular) eukaryotes generally grouped under Kingdom Protista. Protozoans were among the earliest life forms on earth and have a simple body plan. Most of the protozoans are very small, and can only be seen through a microscope. They live in soil and aquatic environments such as lakes (fresh water) and oceans. 

Protozoans exist as individuals, but some are colonial. 

All the metabolic activities of an organism like respiration, digestion, excretion and reproduction are carried out by these single celled organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phylum Porifera (&quot;pori&quot; = pores, &quot;fera&quot; = bearers) popularly known as sponges, a group simple organisms. Sponges are sessile organisms found attached to a substratum.

The majority of sponges are marine, living in seas and oceans. There is one family of fresh water sponges (Family Spongillidae).

Unlike Protozoans, the Poriferans are multicellular. However unlike higher metazoans the cells that make up a sponge are not organised into tissues. Primarily their body consists of a thin sheet of cells over a frame (skeleton).

As their name suggests, Poriferans are charecterized by the presence of minute pores called ostia on their body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a little confusing and doesn't follow conventions from other articles (most notably keynames, such as '''GKEY''' or '''WKEY'''). It also isn't part of the chain of next/previous pagelinks. Perhaps someone should fix this? If I have time I might revise it a little bit. [[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 20:41, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

I agree. This tutorial is not as clear as the previous ones. 

== good stuff, a couple minor issues though ==

In addition to the above mentioned problems with keyboard naming convention, there's a lot of confusion between panel / window etc... this stuff could be cleared up a lot.  In particular, the section on assigning materials is VERY confusing... clearing up the nomenclature and adding some screenshots would be very helpful.

Also, a suggestion... the modelling goes MUCH quicker if you extrude and merge the 'dots' BEFORE you spin-dupe the dice.  (i.e., after applying your face loop cuts to one side of the die and deleting the other sides, extrude and merge the 9 faces that will become dots.  Then spin dupe and you save a lot of time extruding and merging) ... note that this will change the correct number of vertices we should have after removing duplicates (since we add 9 vertices to our side * 6 sides = 54 new vertices, + the 384 originally... now we should 438 vertices after spin-duping and removing duplicate vertices).

I'd be happy to help edit this thing... not really sure how that works though :)

== About the step after loop cut ==

The step 5 is not leading to any option to enter numbers directly. Or am I missing something? I have tried it many times before I have added the comment. car313

I have problems with section 18. I cann't assign the color to the dents. A few pictures of the process would help.

== And here is where I quit the tutorial due to frustration. ==
I ''AM'' using blender 2.4, so this might be a part of the problem, I'm a total noob when it comes to blender. I can't get the &quot;loop cut&quot; exact using my mouse (I'm using a logitech g5 2000 dpi laser mouse), it jumps from .168 to .174, and from .338 to .344 (there has got to be a way to type these in right?). I went ahead and did &quot;loop cut&quot; form NUM1 and NUM3, then horizontally on NUM3 so I allready had all the grids I needed. After removing the bottom in section 8, and putting the 3d cursor at 0,0,0 &quot;spin dup&quot; following the directions ''DID NOT'' produce a cube the ends of the dupes protruded through the sides of each other in a # shape, so I figured it was due to my use of the cube blender creates by  default, however I see no way to aligh the cube so the bottom is on the surface of the grid(like just typing the value, as in maya),which would allow &quot;spin dup&quot; to do what was intended. personally I would like to see the &quot;simple person&quot; and &quot;mountain out of a mole hill&quot; continued as I have a feeling of a loss of continuity with the &quot;puppy from a cube&quot; stub, and &quot;gingerbread man&quot; which seems to dupe &quot;simple person&quot;. As I said I am a complete '''NOOB''', today is the first day I have ever used blender, I would be more then happy to contribute to the tutorials ''once I figure this freaking program out''.
I would like to see the &quot;simple person&quot; and &quot;mountains&quot; continued untill there is a &quot;detailed person&quot; in a &quot;lifelike setting&quot; for now I have to search for other tutorials. [[User:Drn8|Drn8]] 23:58, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== How to enter numbers at step 5 ==
I use Blender 2.4, and I am also a beginner.

After several trials, I think I found the way to enter numbers at STEP 5.

You have to move the cursor to the bottom bar of 3D viewer window and click LMB(laft mouse button) once. Then press GKEY &amp;rArr; XKEY(or Y, Z) &amp;rArr; enter numbers you want--[[User:140.116.202.68|140.116.202.68]] 16:14, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

As of Blender 2.4 loop cut seems to allow you to enter the number of cuts you want to make. So if you select k-&gt;loop cut, select the face and then enter KEY9 you can get the described effect without the hasslo of measuring the sections.

== how to turn on subdivision surfaces? ==

hi,
i think this is a good tutorial, since i understood everything right, until point 12:
&quot;12. Tab out of editmode. If you haven't done this already, hit set smooth in the editing panel and turn on subdivision surfaces&quot;
i did everything exactly as it was said, but i can't find a button to turn on &quot;subdivision surfaces&quot; and the screenshot doesn't help me either.
do i have to add a &quot;subsurf modifier&quot;? but when i do this it doesn't look like the following screenshot in the tutorial nor can i turn it on or off, as it is said.
any help? i think i'm just missing something, but i can't get it.
thanks

Shade

The tutorial says, &quot;In 2.41, you will need to use &quot;Add Modifier&quot; on the Modifiers tab, to add a SubSurf modifier.&quot;  --Davidfg4

== colour ==

i cannot mak two differrent colours. why?
if i make a new material it is the same like first, so all my materials are the same. what should i do? my version of blender is 2.41

[User Answer: I am also relatively new to Blender, using 2.41 and found this point particularly frustrating until I solved it.  The key to using materials to make seperate colours is to step between the ''Edit: Link and Materials'' tab and the ''Shading: Material'' tab.

In summary: you must make new materials in the Edit panel using the 'Link and Materials' tab, seperate then colour the materials in the Shading panel using the Materials tab under the Materials button, then go back to the Edit panel and assign different materials to specific layers.

Make sure you are in Edit Mode and have the whole mesh selected before you start.

1. Go to the Edit panel, look under the Link and Materials tab (hit F9 to go to the edit pnael).  Delete any materials you have created using the 'Delete' button. Create the number of materials you need - in this case two.  Click 'new' twice - you will see '2 Mat 2' in the dialog box above.

2. Go to the Shading panel (hit F5), find the 'Materials' tab and click on the number '2' to the right of the OB and ME buttons.  You'll be asked if you want to make these single user - comply with 'yes'.  Use arrows either side of '2 Mat 2' to switch between the two materials.  This is the bit where you assign the colours to the two materials - stick with red for the first and white for the second.  After you have done this your dice will be entirely red.

3. Got back to the Edit panel, then make sure you have the faces (not just vertices) of the indents selected - there will be four triangular faces for each indent.  Then select the second material, the white one, then assign.

If you find these steps useful go back to the Penguin you made in an earlier tutorial and apply the same process to give it a white chest, orange beaks and feet.

Blender is a very complex tool but even after only a few days I can see the sheer potential.  If you get stuck whilst following a tutorial try searching google using search terms relating to the operation you are having difficulty with you are stuck on (e.g. &quot;blender 3d materials howto&quot;), or consulting the manual on the blender site.  You will usually find others will have had the same difficulties as you.  Good luck!]

== A revised page ==

I have tried to get to grips with Blender for a long time and not until I came across this Noob to Pro set of tutorials have I made any progess. This, I hope, will be something to give back to the community.

I have nearly finished a revised page, based on 2.41, incorporating the suggestions and alternative paragraphs which have already been added to the existing page, with changes where 2.41 does things differently and additional images.

I don't know anything about modifying wikibooks — where can I put it so that you can “mercilessly” edit it?

wynnmc

The revised page has been added to the Noob to Pro Contents and created.

There are a few whimperings in the discussion page there...

--[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] 11:11, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

== Incorporating 2.42 ==

This is a very good tutorial, but with the new version out it can be extremely simplyfied.

The note below the first point already explains how to skip point 3-9.
Point 10 and 11 can be combined into one since you can now just select all the faces for one side of the dice, extrude and move them backwards and merge→collapse them.

I'm willing to make these changes myself. Just give me a go. -- [[User:DanMan|DanMan]] 10:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Lack of subsections ==
It would be fine to make a structure with subtitles. --[[User:N comme Nul|N comme Nul]] 20:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

== Die easy ==

I strongly favor the &quot;Die easy&quot; tutorial over this one. It's much clearer and easier. Anyone agree? ~
Yes, this tutorial seems like a waste of time.[[User:Mdd4696 |MDD]][[User talk:Mdd4696 |46]][[Special:Contributions/Mdd4696 |96]] 03:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== Die Easy (proposed revision) ==

Thanks to Mdd4696 for the compliment. Credit should be given to the author of Die Another Way for all the hard work put in finding out '''how''' to model dice: dividing the faces to get the pip locations, making the pips round instead of square, colouring them — not to mention the arrangement of the pips on the faces and their spacing. Hours of work — and then there's writing it all down so a Noob can follow.

After a time away from Blender I have come back and discovered that Die Easy has now been overtaken by Blender versions and could do with an update.

However, I don't want this to seem a competition between Die Another Way and Die Easy. Die Easy was written because it seemed to me that updating Die Another Way would end up in a mess and starting afresh would produce something that Noobs (like me) could follow.

Again it seems that there are so many things to remove and user suggestions to add to Die Easy that it should be rewritten from scratch.

But, before that, I would like to be sure that it is not seen as a competition and that a revised Die Easy would be welcome.

Please let me know what you think.

I would also like to hear what the author of Die Another Way thinks too.

== Having problem with the pips. ==

Thanks for this great tutorial. I am only having a problem with the pips.Here is the screenshot of what I have so far: [http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/1839/diezg6.png link title] As you can see that the perimeter around the pips are not sharp. This happens when I click &quot;set smooth&quot; button. If I don't click 'set smooth' then the dice looks edgy, but when I click, this time the pips are smoothed out and doesn't look sharp. Can anyone tell me what should I do here? Thanks in advance.

----

Yes, I got the same problem (the pip edges are not sharp when &quot;set smooth&quot; is used). What I did, instead of using &quot;set smooth&quot; I bumped up the subserf level to 6. It slowed down everything considerably, but allowed me to get sharp edges.

I wonder what we did wrong.

Yeah. I have that problem. I'm using blender 2.48 and when I click Set Smooth the edges don't look sharp.

Is there any way to stop this happening?

== Edge Creasing the Pips; regarding the Newbie Note ==

I'm using version 2.49a, and I found that you can indeed select all of the pip edges when using SHIFT+EKEY then mouse to crease all of the pip edges at once.  If anyone else wants to verify that this works, perhaps the newbie note should be amended that this isn't an issue any longer from version 2.49a onwards.

== Camera Setup. How to? ==

I've tried to setup camera with help of Fly mode (BTW it's very comfortable :)). But my problem is that: When I switch to edit mode and try to rotate view, it move around the camera, not dice. How to change it?

== Easier way to locate the pips ==

It is very easy to find the centre of the pips simply by selecting the faces and using '''WKEY'''-&gt;''Subdivide multi'', and entering 9. With 9 divisions on each face, you will have one node at each pip centre.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Finding the angles between two objects is a handy thing to be able to do in a script. It would mostly be useful for finding &lt;i&gt;angular separations&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;phase angles&lt;/b&gt; (illustrated below) which can be used for a variety of other purposes.

[[Image:Celx_angles.jpg]]

The &lt;b&gt;angular separation&lt;/b&gt; between two objects seen is a measure of how far apart they are in the sky as seen by the observer. 

The &lt;b&gt;phase angle&lt;/b&gt; is usually described for non-emissive objects orbiting stars (e.g. planets, asteroids, comets, moons, etc.) and is the angle of illumination of the object seen by an observer. It is the angle between the Star-Target line and the Target-Observer line. Using the image as an example, a phase angle of 0 degrees means that the observer is directly between the star and the planet - thus, the star is behind the observer, and the planet would appear &quot;Full&quot; to the viewer. A phase angle of 90 or 270 degrees means that the observer is over the terminator of the planet (the line dividing day and night), so he would see a 'Half-Full&quot; planet. A phase angle of 180 degrees means that the planet is directly between the observer and the star, so the observer is in the planet's shadow and would see a &quot;New&quot; planet. At intermediate phase angles the observer would see a crescent or gibbous planet. 

==Theory==

Celestia stores the positions of objects as a table consisting of an x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and z-coordinate. The line connecting two points is known as a vector, so basically we're finding the angle between two vectors. First we have to calculate each of the vectors. To do this we find the positions of the objects at either end of the line, and then simply subtract one from the other. So in order to calculate a Phase Angle, the vector of the Star-Planet line is (position of the planet - position of the star), and the vector of the Observer-Planet line is (position of the planet - position of the observer). 

Once we have these vectors, we need to use a special mathematical function used for vectors called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product Dot Product]. This is reproduced below:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a \, b \cos \theta \;&lt;/math&gt;


We'd refer to this as &quot;a dot b&quot;, where a and b are the vectors involved. The &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; on the right-hand-side of the equation are the &lt;i&gt;lengths&lt;/i&gt; of the two vectors multiplied together, and the angle theta is the angle between the two vectors. In this case, Celestia already knows what the vectors are (and how long they are and what the angle is between them) and so can calculate the dot product - we just need to extract the information we want in a script. We can also normalise the vectors so that the lengths equal 1 - this makes the calculation a little simpler (and conveniently enough there's a 'normalize' script command that does this). This reduces the equation we need in the script to:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \arccos (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \;&lt;/math&gt;

The script below illustrates how to perform this calculation in Celx.

==Download the script==

This is a complete script that you can run as-is to display the phase angle to a target in the solar system. The target must already be selected before the script is run. 

 camera = celestia:getobserver()			-- set camera object
 target = celestia:getselection()	 		-- set target object
 sunpos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol&quot;):getposition()		-- find sun position
 campos = camera:getposition()				-- find camera position
 planpos = target:getposition()				-- find target position
 sun_target_vector = planpos - sunpos			-- determine sun-target vector
 obs_target_vector = planpos - campos			-- determine observer-target vector
 phase_angle = math.acos(sun_target_vector:normalize() * obs_target_vector:normalize())	-- find phase angle (in radians) 
 celestia:flash(&quot;Phase angle to target is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%.2f&quot;, math.deg(phase_angle))..&quot; degrees\n&quot;)

It seemed odd that the definition of continuity didn't include all three conditions needed for continuity, so I added the other two. If someone could make it look pretty that would be great. 
On a completely different note, it would also be good if we could get an example of all three conditions failing, as well as some pictures?--''anon 1''

Yes pictures are both important and necessary.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:23, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

I reverted ''anon one'', the conditions you added are necessary but not sufficient conditions of continuity. i.e. The definition already implies the conditions.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:28, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Expanding ==

One of the ways this can be expanded is with the intermediate value theorem (IVM). [[User:Zginder|Zginder]] 14:06, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

== Inconsistency ==
We currently state that:
:Remember that, if f is built out of rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions, then the limit of f at any point in its domain is just its value at that point. So, by our definition, all such functions are continuous. 
Which is certainly one point of view.  My first comment would be that telling students tan(x) or 1/x are continuous because where they are discontinuous they are not defined misses the spirit of things a bit.  A more serious problem is our first example of a removable discontinuity is &lt;math&gt;x^2-9 \over x-3 &lt;/math&gt;, which is certainly a rational function, so we just finished saying it was continuous. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 18:57, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

This is a more or less necessary consequence of defining &quot;continuous&quot; to mean &quot;continuous at every real number in the domain&quot;. This is the right definition for functions on general metric spaces. I agree that it's probably confusing for people just starting calculus, which is why (I believe) most calculus textbooks define &quot;continuous&quot; to mean &quot;continuous at every real number&quot;. But, it's a definition, so, at the end of the day, there's no right or wrong answer, so long as you then use the word consistently in accordance with the definition.

In terms of the example, &lt;math&gt;x^2-9 \over x-3 &lt;/math&gt; ''is'' continuous according to our definition; it's not continuous at 3, but it's not defined at 3 either.

I have no problem with changing to the more usual definition of continuous, anyway, if you want to solve the problem that way.--[[User:Warshall|Warshall]] ([[User talk:Warshall|talk]]) 15:05, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:I think we should change the definition.  At the level of this book it is easier to define the unquantified term '''continuous''' to be continuous on the real line, since the style of the book so far is to not worry about specifying the domain of the functions that it defines, and when we want to be careful we can always say &quot;continuous on ...&quot; [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:40, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

== Pencil lifting disconnect ==

Maybe I'm just failing to see it, but there seems to be a lack of logical connection between the intuitive notion of continuity meaning you can draw the graph of the function without lifting your pencil and the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).  For example, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=-x^2-1&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the points &lt;math&gt;a=-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The IVT tells us nothing whatsoever about the function in this case, because &lt;math&gt;f(a)=0=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, so there are no points between &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt;.  I'm not saying that the IVT doesn't imply the intuitive notion of continuity, but the text doesn't seem to properly draw out the connection if there is one.  [[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 15:40, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
:After thinking about this further, I have removed the following text from the page, 
:{{quotation|The definition of continuity we've given might not seem to have much to do with the intuitive notion we started with of being able to draw the graph without lifting one's pencil. Fortunately, there is a connection, given by the so-called intermediate value theorem, which says, informally, that if a function is continuous then its graph can be drawn without ever picking up one's pencil.}}
:Consider an even more degenerate example than the one I gave earlier:  &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Not only does the IVT not tell us anything using &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, but it will also tell us exactly squat for any other pair of points we choose in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.  Maybe someone could argue that the IVT requires continuity, and the pencil-lifting intuition can be derived in this case from the definition of continuity.  However, I think it is misleading to make the statement I quoted, so I removed it.

The partitive a (or for that matter, ä/ta/tä/tta/ttä)is not a plural indicator at all.  It is a partitive indicator... that is that the object is part of a larger universe of objects.  

The rule is that after a number, the object case is always put in the partitive singular.  The rules for the partitive singular are much complex than just adding a to the word!

OK, the book is at an early stage, but what is written should be accurate.

Can the author please correct this?

Umm... This is a wiki... you can correct it too!

== NPOV problems ==

I know this is a difficult thing to do, but it is important that we write with a [[WB:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] when we write content here.  This is, I admit, a certain philosophy and way of writing, but it is important to do this so we can avoid edit wars and stop using Wikibooks as ground for preaching certain philosophies at the exclusion of other ideas.  There is a long tradition of using NPOV guidelines at Wikipedia, and that same philosophy also holds true here on Wikibooks.   Please read the above link and other related links if you have a question over what is a neutral point of view.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:52, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

== Switched picture ==

I switched the picture of Queen Esther into Jesus as I figured that Jesus was a far more famous Hebrew. I tried to pick a picture that emphasized his Jewishness. Hopefully no one feels offence about that. I'm happy to discuss the issue if it bothers anyone.

== Report after viewing this page ==
=== Coverage ===
Good.

=== Accuracy ===
No comment.

=== Grammar and tone ===
I've done a few copy-edits to this page. I think there are still some unclear places, especially:
* The food and drinks. Lots of ideas scattered in the paragraph. Needs some coherence.
* The translation of Jesus and Zeus and Messiah. I was completely confused.
* The furniture. Sounds too complicated, but then still understandable.

==Helping with a class==
Basejumper123

I am a physics professor at Clarion University -- and am teaching two sections of physical science next semester. I would like to make it a class assignment to help develop this book. The way I was planning on doing it was breaking it up into sections - with each student getting a (or possibly several) topic(s) - that they were responsible for researching outside of class -- writing a short lecture -- and the appropriate text for the wiki book. I along with other students would edit it - and check for accuracy. I think this will be particularly useful method for developing practice problems...although I do have some concerns about keeping the quality high. I have been using wiki's in my class this semester - and it has been quite rewarding for the students and I think useful. See http://www.appropedia.org/PH261 as the course develops. Doing projects like the LED project -- through a mass class collaboration has been very good...see for example -- http://www.appropedia.org/LED_FAQ

What do you think?
Please drop me a line - jpearce@clarion.edu

Best regards - Joshua

== Introduction ==

This book is intended to be a guide for prospective fantasy/sci-fi novelists.  I have given a broad outline of the intended structure of this book. Please feel free to edit and contribute wholeheartedly.

There are lots of wannabe writers out there — J.K. Rowlings or J.R.R. Tolkiens in the making.  I feel there is a story (or maybe more than one) hidden in each one of us.  If only we can bring it&amp;nbsp;/ them out, and package it well, it would be a bestseller.  This book will help you with that process.

Welcome to Wikibooks and thanks for your engagement!

Have you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]? Article titles like 'Preface' are confusing to users, because it's not clear, to which book the chapter belongs. Many books can have chapter called 'Preface'. To avoid this, we name pages like: 'Kabbalah/Preface'. Could you please rename your book? You can create new pages and add replace contents of unused old pages by &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|usused}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 07:36, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Shalmanese. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Shalmanese~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hebrew nouns are not hard at all, esspecially for most Germanic-language speakers.

== Gender ==
In Hebrew, nouns have gender. This concept may be a little difficult for English speakers to grasp, but it is not hard at all (some English words are gendered too, e.g. ships are referred to as &quot;she&quot;).

There are &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; types of noun gender (unlike German which has 3): Masculine and Feminine. Telling the difference is quite easy. The basic rule is:
* Most feminine nouns end in either the letter &lt;font size=5&gt;ת&lt;/font&gt; or the letter &lt;font size=5&gt;ה&lt;/font&gt;.
* Most masculine nouns end in every other letter.
Of course, there are some nouns that are assigned to a certain gender logically. For example, the word &lt;font size=5&gt;יֵלֶד&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;b&gt;yeled&lt;/b&gt; - boy) is masculine, while &lt;font size=5&gt;יַלְדָה&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;b&gt;yalda&lt;/b&gt; - girl) is feminine.

== The article ==
There is only one article in Hebrew (in English there are three: &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a/an&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt;): &lt;font size=5&gt;הַ&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;ha&lt;b&gt; ). This translates into English as ''the''. There is no article &lt;i&gt;a/an&lt;/i&gt;. So &lt;font size=5&gt;תַּפּוּחַ&lt;/font&gt; ( '''tapuakh''' - apple ) can be either ''an apple'' or just ''apple'' ( depending on the context ). This article is easy and straight forward. It is a &lt;i&gt;prefix&lt;/i&gt;, meaning it is added to the beginning of a noun. Simply add &lt;font size=5&gt;הַ&lt;/font&gt; ( the letter ''hey'' ) to the beginning of the noun.
=== Examples ===
Here are some examples using &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; article.

&lt;font size=5&gt;הַמַּחְשֵׁב&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;ha-machshev&lt;/b&gt; the computer
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;הָאִישָׁה&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;ha-isha&lt;/b&gt; the woman
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;הַסֵּפֶר&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;ha-sefer&lt;/b&gt; the book

== Plural ==
Noun plural in Hebrew is quite straight forward and easy. The rules are:
*Feminine nouns change the ''gender suffix'' ( the letter at the end of the word that tells us what gender the noun is ) into &lt;font size=5&gt;וֹת&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;vav-tav&lt;/b&gt; )
*Masculine nouns change the gender suffix into &lt;font size=5&gt;ים&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;yod-mem&lt;/b&gt; )
Of course, there are some exceptions. For example, the noun &lt;font size=5&gt;שׁוּלְחָן&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;shulhan&lt;/b&gt; - table ) is a masculine ( ends in &lt;font size=5&gt;נ&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;noon&lt;/b&gt; ), but its plural is &lt;font size=5&gt;שוּלְחָנוֹת&lt;/font&gt; ( notice the &lt;font size=5&gt;ות&lt;/font&gt; at the end of the noun). These irregularities will have to be memorized when learned.

=== Examples ===
Here are some examples of plurals.

&lt;font size=5&gt;יְלדִים&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;yeladim&lt;/b&gt; kids, boys
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;קְלפִים&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;k'laphim&lt;/b&gt; cards
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;מִדפּסוֹת&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;midpasot&lt;/b&gt; printers

== Exercises ==
# Determine whether the following nouns are masculine or feminine, then pluralize them:
## &lt;font size=5&gt;ספר
##&lt;font size=5&gt; ספרייה
##&lt;font size=5&gt; גנן
##&lt;font size=5&gt; מַיִם
##&lt;font size=5&gt; אוּנִיבֶרְסִיטָה
##&lt;font size=5&gt; יפּנית
##&lt;font size=5&gt; סיפּוּר
##&lt;font size=5&gt; כּסף
&lt;/font&gt;

== Periodic Inputs ==

=== System Response ===

== Plotting Results ==

From the polar form of the Fourier series, we can see that essentially, there are 2 quantities that Fourier series provides: Magnitude, and Phase shift. If we simplify the entire series into the polar form, we can see that instead of being an infinite sum of different sinusoids, we get simply an infinite sum of cosine waves, with varying magnitude and phase parameters. This makes the entire series easier to work with, and also allows us to begin working with different graphical methods of analysis.

=== Magnitude Plots ===

It is important to remember at this point that the Fourier series turns a continuous, periodic time signal into a discrete set of frequency components. In essence, any plot of Fourier components will be a ''stem'' plot, and will not be continuous. The user should never make the mistake of attempting to '''interpolate''' the components into a smooth graph.

The magnitude graphs of a Fourier series representation plots the magnitude of the coefficient (either &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; in polar, or &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; in exponential form) against the frequency, in radians per second. The X-axis will have the independent variable, in this case the frequency. The Y-axis will hold the magnitude of each component. The magnitude can be a measure of either current or voltage, depending on how the original signal was represented. Keep in mind, however, that most signals, and their resulting magnitude plots, are discussed in terms of voltage (not current).

=== Phase Plots ===

Similar to the magnitude plots, the phase plots of the Fourier representation will graph the phase angle of each component against the frequency. Both the frequency (X-axis), and the phase angle (Y-axis) will be plotted in units of radians per seconds. Occasionally, Hertz may be used for one (or even both), but this is not the normal case. Like the magnitude plot, the phase plot of a Fourier series will be discrete, and should be drawn as individual points, not as smooth lines.

== Power ==

Frequently, it is important to talk about the '''power''' in a given periodic wave. It is also important to talk about how much power is being transmitted in each different harmonic. For instance, if a certain channel has a limited bandwidth, and is filtering out some of the harmonics of the signal, then it is important to know how much power is being removed from the signal by the channel. 

=== Normalization ===

Let us now take a look at our equation for power:

:&lt;math&gt;P = iv&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|Ohm's Law:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;v = ir&lt;/math&gt;}}

If we use Ohm's Law to solve for v and i respectively, and then plug those values into our equation, we will get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;P = i^2R = \frac{v^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

If we '''normalize''' the equation, and set R = 1, then both equations become much easier. In any case where the words &quot;normalized power&quot; are used, it denotes the fact that we are using a normalized resistance (R = 1).

To &quot;de-normalize&quot; the power, and find the power loss across a load with a non-normalized resistance, we can simply divide by the resistance (when in terms of voltage), and multiply by the resistance (when in terms of current).

=== Power Plots ===

Because of the above result, we can assume that all loads are normalized, and we can find the power in a signal simply by squaring the signal itself. In terms of Fourier Series harmonics, we square the magnitude of each harmonic separately to produce the '''power spectrum'''. The power spectrum shows us how much power is in each harmonic.

== Parsevals Theorem ==

If the Fourier Representation and the Time-Domain Representation are simply two different ways to consider the same set of information, then it would make sense that the two are equal in many ways. The power and energy in a signal when expressed in the time domain should be equal to the power and energy of that same signal when expressed in the frequency domain. '''Parseval's Theorem''' relates the two.

Parsevals theorem states that the power calculated in the time domain is the same as the power calculated in the frequency domain. There are two ways to look at Parseval's Theorem, using the one-sided (polar) form of the Fourier Series, and using the two-sided (exponential) form:

:&lt;math&gt;P = \int_{0}^T f^2(t)dt 
        = X_0^2 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{X_n^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P = \sum_{-\infty}^\infty C_nC_{-n} = \sum_{-\infty}^\infty |C_n|^2&lt;/math&gt;

By changing the upper-bound of the summation in the frequency domain, we can limit the power calculation to a limited number of harmonics. For instance, if the channel bandwidth limited a particular signal to only the first 5 harmonics, then the upper-bound could be set to 5, and the result could be calculated.

== Energy Spectrum ==

With Parseval's theorem, we can calculate the amount of energy being used by a signal in different parts of the spectrum. This is useful in many applications, such as filtering, that we will discuss later.

We know from Parseval's theorem that to obtain the energy of the harmonics of the signal that we need to square the frequency representation in order to view the energy. We can define the '''energy spectral density''' of the signal as the square of the Fourier transform of the signal:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_F(\theta) = \mathcal{F}^2(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the graph at different frequencies represents the amount energy located within those frequency components.

== Power Spectral Density ==

The  energy in a signal is the amount of power in a signal. To find the power spectrum, or '''power spectral density''' (PSD) of a signal,

take the Fourier Transform of the Auto Correlation of the signal(which is in frequency domain).

== Signal to Noise Ratio ==

In the presence of noise, it is frequently important to know what is the ratio between the signal (which you want), and the noise (which you don't want). The ratio between the noise and the signal is called the '''Signal to Noise Ratio''', and is abbreviated with the letters '''SNR'''.

There are actually 2 ways to represent SNR, one as a straight-ratio, and one in decibels. The two terms are functionally equivalent, although since they are different quantities, they cannot be used in the same equations. It is worth emphasizing that decibels cannot be used in calculations the same way that ratios are used.

:&lt;math&gt;SNR = \frac{Signal}{Noise}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the SNR can be in terms of either power or voltage, so it must be specified which quantity is being compared. Now, when we convert SNR into decibels:

:&lt;math&gt;SNR_{db} = 10log_{10} \left(\frac{Signal}{Noise}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, an SNR of 3db means that the signal is twice as powerful as the noise signal. A higher SNR (in either representation) is always preferable.</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Aztec or Nahuatl writing is a pictographic and ideographic system the Aztecs used to write Nahuatl. It is not considered to be a true writing system since there were no set of characters that represented specific words, but rather ideas. Nahuatl today is written in Roman characters used by the Spaniards when they began annotating the language.

The spelling rules are largely based on then-Spanish orthography, rather than phonemic rules and therefore have not perfect grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence.
==Vowels==
Nahuatl has four short vowels: '''a''', '''e''', '''i''', and '''o'''. The vowels '''a''', '''e''' and '''i''' sound similar to Spanish, while '''o''' can sound like either a Spanish ''o'' or a ''u''. Unlike in English, where ''cuter'' and ''cutter'' have different vowels, the vowels of Nahuatl don't change depending on what follows them.

Each vowel also has a long form, marked by a line or ''macron'' over the vowel: '''ā''', '''ē''', '''ī''', '''ō'''. They have the same sound as the short vowels, but are simply held longer.

==Consonants==
Nahuatl '''ch''', '''m''', '''n''', '''p''', '''t''', and '''y''' are pronounced like English.

As in English, '''c''' represents an s-sound when followed by '''e''' or '''i''', but a k-sound elsewhere.

'''Cu''' is pronounced ''kw'', like in Spanish, or like English ''qu''. Its inverse, '''uc''', is the same sound at the end of a syllable.

'''Hu''' is pronounced like English ''w''. Like '''cu''', it is reversed at the end of a syllable, so '''auh''' sounds like ''ow'', and '''iuh''' sounds like ''eww''.

'''H''' alone, when not part of '''ch''', '''hu''' or '''uh''', may have represented a glottal stop, as in the Cockney pronunciation of ''bottle'', or it may have been a sound like English ''h''. Unlike English ''h'', it is pronounced at the end of syllables: '''ah''' isn't simply a vowel, but a vowel followed by a consonant.

Before a vowel, '''l''' is the same as English or Spanish ''l''. Before a consonant or at the end of a word, however, it is neither dark like English ''l'' in ''full'', nor clear like Spanish ''l''. It is a voiceless sound, like Welsh ''ll''. This isn't important to understanding, though, and it can be pronounced like an English ''l'' without introducing confusion.

Double '''ll''' is simply '''l''', held longer. It isn't a palatal sound like in Spanish, or a single ''l'' like in English.

'''Qu''' is used to represent the k-sound before '''e''' and '''i''', like in Spanish. It isn't pronounced &quot;kw&quot; as in English.

'''X''' is pronounced like English ''sh''.

'''Tl''' is pronounced like '''t''' with the tongue held in a postion for '''l''' 

'''Tz''' is pronounced like German ''z'', or like English ''ts'' except that the ''t'' is pronounced even at the start of words — not like ''tsar'' or ''tsunami'', where the t may be silent for some speakers.

'''Z''' is pronounced like English ''s''.

==Stress==
Stress regularly falls on the second last syllable of a word.
==Spelling==
The spelling used here is a modern standardized system, in order to represent all the sounds of Nahuatl consistently. The spelling used in the original manuscripts did not always represent Nahuatl pronunciation accurately. In particular, vowel length and '''h''' were usually omitted.

Spelling &amp; Pronunciation of Classical Nahuatl Words

Because the spelling of Nahuatl was originally based on spelling conventions in Spanish, Nahuatl texts are generally &quot;pronounced like Spanish,&quot; with the following exceptions and points to note:

* Words are stressed on the second-to-the-last vowel (excluding U) regardless of final consonants
* X is pronounced like English SH.
* LL is pronounced like a long L (not as in Spanish).
* TL counts as a single consonant, never as a full syllable.
* U does not occur as an independent vowel. The only Nahuatl vowels are A, E, I, and O, although each of them can be long or short.
* CU and UC are both pronounced KW.
* HU and UH are both pronounced W.
* H without an adjacent U represents a &quot;silent&quot; glottal stop (as in go_over); in modern Nahuatl it sometimes has a sound similar to an English H and may have had that value in some dialects of Classical Nahuatl as well. (For an English speaker, pronouncing the H like an English H is not really wrong and has the advantage that it helps one remember that it is there.)
* C before E or I is pronounced like English S. (The letter S is not used in Classical Nahuatl.)
* Z is pronounced like English S. (The letter S is not used in Classical Nahuatl.)

However over the centuries there has been considerable instability in the spelling of Nahuatl. Some common variations:

* The letters U and O may be used interchangeably to represent the sound of O.
* The letter U alone may be used instead of UH or HU to represent the sound of W.&lt;br&gt;(At the time of the Conquest, the written letters V and U were usually reversed in Spanish from their modern values, so U indeed had the value of a modern English W.)
* The letter H representing the glottal stop may or may not be written.
* Vowel length may or may not be marked.
* The consonant Y may be written with the letter I.
* The vowel I may be written with the letter Y.
* The letter Ç may be used in place of Z to represent the sound of S. 

In this century, linguists working with modern Nahuatl have sometimes preferred spellings that look less Spanish and more in accord with [[wikipedia:IPA | IPA]] usage. Thus:

* W may be used in place of HU or UH for the sound of W.
* K may be used in place of QU/C for the sound of K.
* S may be used in place of Z/C for the sound of S. 

For compound letters, single symbols may also be used to match the [[wikipedia:Americanist phonetic notation | Americanist orthography]] found in other writings about North American indigenous languages:
* '''ƛ''' for TL
* '''č''' for CH
* '''¢''' for TZ
* '''k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;''' for CU/UC

This is done in order to stress that these are single consonants, not compounds. However, these symbols are rare and not found on standard keyboards, so they are not widely adopted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Technological Utopia ==
There have been many attempts to find a technological solution to the worlds problems, indeed there is a body of thought which states that ever since the start of the industrial revolution, and some would even say since man first tamed fire; that humanity has been on a quest to fix every problem which we encounter with a clever invention.  The end goal of such a quest must surely be a technological utopia.

== What is a technological utopia? ==
A Technological Utopia uses Civil Engineering, And Sociology, as well as Modern Psychology, as platforms from which to generate a design. A technological Utopia has several key advantages, in that
it may be true that Technology and science have sufficient answers to
generate at least a stable society, whereas previous Utopian experiments have been doomed to failure, primarily because of serious lack of real problem solving process.

Basically it is a system of civilization where by technology alleviates any burden that may otherwise oppress a citizen.

The problems with any Utopia ideals are the ways in which actual 
conditions and realities and entropy can cut down mere ideals and generate a dystopia. Dystopian visions of a technological society include &quot;The Borg&quot; From &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and any of several other fictional explorations of possible futures.

== Technophobia and technological dystopias ==
The amazing possibilities of new technologies to vastly change the world we live in have long been understood not only to bring life changing and brilliant new things into the world but also terrible new dangers. mass technophobia can be seen almost with out fail at the dawn of any new technology, be it the first manned flying machines or current cloning research; there is a natural reaction to fear unknown and new technologies. Through out human history this has been true - for example, recent research has suggested that the Romans had invented the steam engine but chose by decree of the emperor not to use it, preferring to keep there large slave workforce busy and thus avoid any possibility of a populist uprising&lt;sup&gt;citation needed&lt;/sup&gt;.

George Orwell’s '1984' is a classic example of a dystopian portrayal of developing technologies and how they could be used to intrude into peoples lives and take away the freedoms and pleasures which we take for granted. '1984' was written in 1948 a time when television sets were becoming a common site in many well to do British homes, Orwell hypothesizes on their development into a method of control and has Big Brother use 'telley screens' to not only brainwash his citizens but also to watch constantly for any sign of disobedience. Many would argue that today’s CCTV culture which has everyone under constant surveillance is close to Orwell’s dark vision, and the constant drone of propaganda filling every room even more so.

In today’s world the fear of technology has not decreased as our understanding of science has increased, in fact with every new possibility come new fears. 'The matrix' achieved mass market success by investigated the now fairly common story of artificial intelligence gone wrong. The Japanese manga 'Ghost in the Shell' investigates the impact of artificial intelligence and super computing on a futuristic world and the dangers which it could bring. Human cloning, DNA modification, super toxins, weapons of mass destruction, etc, etc have all had loads of front page scare story headlines in recent years.

== What would make a technological utopia ==

A machine which could control atoms to a subatomic level, that would turn base metal into gold has been the alchemists dream for thousands of years.  There is a good reason for this, almost all wars that have ever been fought have in some way been over some hard to find natural resource, be it gold, tin, water or oil.  If then there was found a way to turn any one element into another then there would presumably be no need to fight over many of the currently most war torn areas of the world.  Further more, if a device which worked like the famous 'replicator' device featured in the cult tv series Star Trek, where by simply selecting from a menu you could create any item that has been programed in it would remove any need for transport, manifacture and retail.  Assuming enough energy to run such a machine could be found most of the worlds problems would theoretically dissolve.

A person wouldn't need a large dwelling as there would be no need for item storage, a pair of shoes after being worn could be converted back into something else such as air or water.  Extra rooms, sports equipment, etc could be created at will and removed when not in use.  Industrial complexes, retail outlets, warehouses, etc could be removed thus freeing up space for forests or houses.  

Such a technology is undoubtedly far off but through the use of existing and developing technologies a scientifically improved existence is now a realized fact no longer just an idle dream.  Many inventions have greatly added too out quality of life ranging from the obvious such as Heaters, air conditioners, Computers, cars and phones to the subtle everyday devices which we have almost forgotten were once created by science such as the devices of logic, reason and our ever useful and hopefully wide understanding of the world around us.  As Nitzher eluded when he said that 'mankind walks a tight-rope between the beast and the over man.' our development, although it has come a long way; is far from over.

{{Wikipedia|Fourier transform}}

== Aperiodic Signals ==

The opposite of a periodic signal is an '''aperiodic signal'''. An aperiodic function never repeats, although technically an aperiodic function can be considered like a periodic function with an infinite period.

== Background ==

If we consider aperiodic signals, it turns out that we can generalize the Fourier Series sum into an integral named the '''Fourier Transform'''. The Fourier Transform is used similarly to the Fourier Series, in that it converts a time-domain function into a frequency domain representation. However, there are a number of differences:

#Fourier Transform can work on Aperiodic Signals.
#Fourier Transform is an infinite sum of '''infinitesimal sinusoids'''.
#Fourier Transform has an ''inverse transform'', that allows for conversion from the frequency domain back to the time domain.

== Fourier Transform ==

{{Matlab CMD|fft}}

The Fourier Transform is the following integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f(t)) = F(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{-j\omega t}dt&lt;/math&gt;

== Inverse Fourier Transform ==

And the inverse transform is given by a similar integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{F(j\omega) \right\}
        = f(t) 
        = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Using these formulas, time-domain signals can be converted to and from the frequency domain, as needed.

=== Partial Fraction Expansion ===

One of the most important tools when attempting to find the inverse fourier transform is the '''Theory of Partial Fractions'''. The theory of partial fractions allows a complicated fractional value to be decomposed into a sum of small, simple fractions. This technique is highly important when dealing with other transforms as well, such as the Laplace transform and the Z-Transform.

== Duality ==

The Fourier Transform has a number of special properties, but perhaps the most important is the property of '''duality'''. 

We will use a &quot;double-arrow&quot; signal to denote duality. If we have an even signal f, and it's fourier transform F, we can show duality as such:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) \Leftrightarrow F(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the following rules hold true:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = F(j \omega)&lt;/math&gt; AND &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{F(t)\} = f(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice how in the second part we are taking the ''transform of the transformed equation'', except that we are starting in the time domain. We then convert to the original time-domain representation, except using the frequency variable. There are a number of results of the Duality Theorem.

=== Convolution Theorem ===

The '''Convolution Theorem''' is an important result of the duality property. The convolution theorem states the following:

{{TextBox|;Convolution Theorem:''Convolution in the time domain is multiplication in the frequency domain. Multiplication in the time domain is convolution in the frequency domain.''}}

Or, another way to write it (using our new notation) is such:

:&lt;math&gt;A \times B \Leftrightarrow A * B&lt;/math&gt;

=== Signal Width ===

Another principle that must be kept in mind is that signal-widths in the time domain, and bandwidth in the frequency domain are related. This can be summed up in a single statement:

:''Thin signals in the time domain occupy a wide bandwidth. Wide signals in the time domain occupy a thin bandwidth''. 

This conclusion is important because in modern communication systems, the goal is to have thinner (and therefore more frequent) pulses for increased data rates, however the consequence is that a large amount of bandwidth is required to transmit all these fast, little pulses.

== Power and Energy ==

=== Energy Spectral Density ===

Unlike the Fourier Series, the Fourier Transform does not provide us with a number of discrete harmonics that we can add and subtract in a discrete manner. If our channel bandwidth is limited, in the Fourier Series representation, we can simply ''remove'' some harmonics from our calculations. However, in a continuous spectrum, we do not have individual harmonics to manipulate, but we must instead examine the entire continuous signal. 

The Energy Spectral Density (ESD) of a given signal is the square of its Fourier transform. By definition, the ESD of a function ''f(t)'' is given by ''F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(j&amp;omega;)''. The power over a given range (a limited bandwidth) is the integration under the ESD graph, between the cut-off points. The ESD is often written using the variable ''E&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;)''.

:&lt;math&gt;E_f(j\omega) = F^2(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Power Spectral Density ===

The '''Power Spectral Density''' (PSD) is similar to the ESD. It shows the distribution of power in the spectrum of a particular signal. 

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(j \omega) d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Power spectral density and the autocorrelation form a Fourier Transform duality pair. This means that:

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(j\omega) = \mathcal{F}[R_{ff}(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

If we know the auto correlation of the signal, we can find the PSD by taking the Fourier transform. Similarly, if we know the PSD, we can take the inverse Fourier transform to find the auto correlation signal.</text>

Welcome to the wonderful yet complex world of computer animation! Through these pages I will try to show you everything old and new about the new animation system in Blender 2.4. But, before we get started, there are some basic notions about datablocks you should know. Animation in Blender is based on the fact that you have something moving in a Blender scene. For example, a ball bouncing on a floor plane: 

-So you have a scene datablock, which holds some info about the scene itself, as you can see in the Render button window (F10KEY).
-You populate this scene with various objects (which in this case refers to containers for data, not the actual mesh data that shapes the object itself). The only goal of an object is to hold the whereabouts of the data you want to see in your scene. It also holds the object ''instance's'' properties such as &quot;does it have soft body or particle options, and do we draw its name?&quot;. Most of the info on an object can be seen in the Object Window (F7KEY). 

An object links to all of the data you can see in a 3D view such as '''mesh''', '''curves''', '''nurbs''', '''lattices''', '''armatures''', '''metadata''', the '''empty''' property, text, camera and lamps.

So the ball you just added to the scene is in fact a mesh, linked to an object that is in turn linked to the current scene.

Now there are also data blocks you can't see in 3D view, such as '''material''', '''texture''', '''Ipo''', '''action''' and '''image'''. Instead, you have a special window in which to edit them. This is the idea behind the Blender interface, wherein each data block has a window for you to edit the data.

So back to this bouncing ball: It's also moving across the plane! So an &quot;&quot;Ipo&quot;&quot; data block is linked to the object, telling it where in space the object will be at each frame of the animation. This Ipo is editable in the Ipo window when selecting the ball in 3D view. In Blender, the work you are performing is always on the currently active (selected) object and data.

Looking at the OOPS (object oriented programming system) view (or SHIFT-F9KEY), we can get a good idea of the internal data structure:
[[Image:OOPS bouncing.jpg]]

Again, you are working in the scene &quot;Scene&quot;, with an object &quot;Sphere&quot; linked to the mesh data block &quot;Sphere&quot; and the Ipo datablock &quot;ObIpo&quot;. Why is that important? Because from there, you can start playing with the datablocks, linking them all around your projects to reuse old work. For example you can create more than one Ipo, and use the one you want, or tell more than one object to use the same Ipo, or to use the same object in more than one Scene. 

Most of the linking job can be done in the Edit button window (F9KEY). Where you can tell an object to use another mesh's data block for Ipo, material, texture or image. There is always a little dropdown menu button for you to select an already-existing data block.

Now, when it comes to animation, you have to understand the way Blender handles data very well, because using Blender is always  a matter of plugging data blocks together when working with Ipos, actions and NLA objects.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Janette. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Janette~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Material drawn from Dr. John Scanzoni's 2000 book called “Designing Families”

“The Family” is another term that gets tossed around quite a bit in the public sphere with little thoughtful discussion about its underlying conceptualization. It is most consistently deployed in policy discussions to stigmatize what does not conform to the nuclear family style epitomized in the 1950s. The fact that few powerful people can clearly articulate the dynamics changes that have occurred in the history of American families emphasizes their inability to plot a course for family policy that addresses the changes that the 21 st century information age economy will likely require. Furthermore, the backlash against feminist politics that has dominated our cultural imagination for the past 25 years still obscures the consistent problems that the most disadvantaged segments of our society (women, children, minorities) continue to face. Perhaps a different family style could help us mitigate these issues while offering everyone (including men) more freedom to pursue personal fulfillment without endangering their personal security and well being.

US Family History in brief – The agricultural era that lasted up until the turn of last century necessitated extended kin networks for security and mutual aid. Thus, family decision making were very constrained by the needs and desires of one's kin. The escape from these bonds was achieved through migration to urban centers for better industrial jobs, which ushered in what we today know as traditional gender relations and family dynamics: the dating game, non-connected households free from kin control, female domesticity, extended childhood, etc. Although the Great Depression forced many families back into extended family networks for survival purposes, once the recovery had begun and the state had assumed more welfare obligations like social security, [white] families began the march back to non-connectedness in suburbia.

Challenges Facing Families in Post-Industrial America :

Renegotiating Gender Relations – although the feminist movement really got started during the Civil War, the big changes waited another century to occur. When women began to enter the workforce en masse and gain economic bargaining power in the relationships with men, it forever altered the marriage dynamics, in which responsibilities (family/economic) now became negotiable and less circumscribed by gender.

Productivism – with dual earner households now the norm, the problem became how to equitably manage who would do what tasks in families – earn income/do housework/raise children/care for elderly parents – when the only real way for men to maintain respect remained the provider role while women remained as the natural “caretaker domestics”, but now needed jobs for fulfillment and to guard their independence.

External Risk – the threats to family security today are largely a result of the post-industrial economic shift and neoliberal politics. Lifetime employment is an anachronism, job loss is a very real threat, medical costs have soared, earning power has stagnated, and debt has led to a high bankruptcy and low savings rates

Manufactured Risks – the freedom of individuals to pursue their own dreams and desires has also helped to create the context for very unstable nuclear families. The ability of both men and women to compromise family stability to further their careers and divorce to find more fulfillment in other relationships is key.

Contemporary Attempts to Redesign Family and Community :

Religious Communities – the Amish, the Oneida , Israeli Kibbutzim, the Shakers, etc. all attempt to subordinate individual freedoms to traditional group dictates in order to minimize internal conflict

Secular New Age Hippy Communes – these groups often oppositional viewpoints on individual vs. community relations, emphasizing both freedom and collectivity, but mostly ignoring family processes

Common-Interest Fortified Developments – these are higher income gated communities that often define themselves by a certain kind of activity, most notably and commonly golf and country club lifestyles

Age-Homogenized Communities – these communities have thus far arisen only in adult-only format whereby older people ban younger residents and children in particular to maintain continuity and “order”

Innovative info age family policy should reconnect the household and community to do the following:

   1. Achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility (personal empowerment and security)
   2. Pay special attention to advancing the interests of women and children without alienating men
   3. Advance the use of dialogic, or democratic decision making in family and community matters
   4. Directly confront and illuminate the specter of violence and abuse within the household
   5. Provide opportunities for political action within the context of the community

Cohousing Design:

Cohousing advocates the building of individual houses in a way that accentuates the centrality of community. The houses are purposefully built smaller than average with private kitchens, but less space devoted to living rooms. They follow New Urbanist architecture in that they are built close together and multiple stories, with no garages or driveways, but porches and sidewalks occupying the front area of the home instead of a road. Houses are constructed in a circle around a common green area and one house is built much larger than the others to serve as a common house with extra facilities for accommodating common meals, meetings, and recreation. Cars are relegated to parking lots outside the inner circle.

New Everyday Life (NEL) Commitments:

The NEL model was conceived of in Sweden to blend cohousing community design with feminist politics. Keep in mind that Sweden is one of the most prosperous nations in the world, with perhaps the most generous welfare state system, and the most progressive gender policies – and still some people felt that even after taking all this into account and the existence of numerous cohousing communities, something more was still needed to deal with the challenges the information age poses for individuals and families. NEL attempts to institute specific principles (with political agendas) to guide behavior within cohousing.

•  Gender Interchangeability – men and women should actively strive to balance all work and family responsibilities (except gestation/nursing) in order to provide both with the opportunity to fulfill themselves by developing their skills in multiple areas of life – not just work or family… but both

•  Renounce Violence – using force against anyone – man, woman, or child – is expressly prohibited

•  Group Problem Solving – because interconnectedness means that family dynamics have a much broader impact on the community at large, problems like employment, child care, domestic chores, and interactions with others in the community become important to discuss. Also, the community can aid individuals and families by providing extra resources, mediation, or security.

•  Redefined Productivity – due to their “enlightened” view of gender relations, the community can offer men and women rewards for pursuing self-worth in ways that are normally difficult or frowned upon in mainstream society – working for mothers and caring for children for men

•  Collective Responsibility for Children – is the idea that everyone in the community should take an interest in producing high quality children that are competent to play an active role in community affairs as well as in the information age economy… they are an asset to be enriched, not a burden

•  Diversity – this means that the community should actively try to embrace different kinds of individuals and households to provide a flexible and thus resilient social system… older folks, single mothers, and other non-traditional family styles all should have a way to contribute

Other Avenues for NEL Cohousing:

Ecological – many cohousing neighborhoods have opted specifically for green design and intensive shared use facilities that contribute to sustainable levels of resource consumption... it is easier to finance initially expensive sustainable infrastructure and even harder to keep up consumption norms that are dramatically different than those of the general public unless one is embedded in a community of purpose like this

Political – many would argue that in America, the religious right has the ability to mobilize politically through communities of faith centered in churches and church throughout the country… advocates for this type of housing model and the NEL commitments would say that these communities would have the potential to be a counterbalancing force… they may see fit to contract out to the government to provide affordable housing for poor people and minorities that have been stuck in ghettos and ethnic enclaves… or they may emerge in these communities as a local strategy to make life better – the idea of cohousing doesn't have to be grounded in specially designed subdivisions… it can be undertaken in any neighborhood

Economic – some of the hottest technology companies in existence today have very open policies regarding their office environment… employees can bring pets, children, spouses, and whatever else makes them comfortable so long as they put together a quality product in reasonable time spans. With these information age business dynamics, it wouldn't seem a large leap to consider the possibility of having whole firms or their more specialized departments located in cohousing communities. The question would be whether the needs of the community would interfere with individual or team productivity, but this model certainly works in other employment sectors (think about the military) so it could actually be beneficial. How about the idea of having a cohousing community of social scientists to work on various problems in a particular city?

I think it is against general wikibooks policy to have a book designed only to aid in the breaking or cracking of a particular software architecture. Also, from a liability point of view, it might be dangerous for wikibooks to host this information (however interesting). There was a long debate about the[[Reverse Engineering]] book, because it was worried that some parts of that book would aid in illegal actions. I will probably list this book under [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]], and see what the consensus is. 
However, just because this book might not belong on wikibooks, does not mean that the information is not valuable, and should not be disseminated. I won't list this one up for deletion for at least a day, and the deletion process may take several days in and of itself (although some deletions happen very quickly). This should give you plenty of time to move this information to a more suitable location (if you wish to save it at all). If you have any questions, leave me a message on [[User talk:Whiteknight|My talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:30, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

:Actually this info is very good for me... I am right now designing an application... and this has made me rethink the way I am going to store sensitive info... seeing flaws in other security methods really gets you thinking! [[User:220.233.48.200|220.233.48.200]] 13:06, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

::I listed this book up on VFD. If you do not want this book to be deleted, i suggest you vote against the measure. As an alternative, maybe this page should be merged into another book such as the [[Reverse Engineering]] book, which is an alternative that you could suggest --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:00, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

== I agree ==

I believe that this data has its rightful place, but I'm not sure that the place should be here in a freely-accessible forum. As a network admin, I am always looking for ways to streamline the tasks I must attend to daily and this information has been an idea addition to my arsenal of admin trix, but the truth is that out of 100 people that actually use this information, my bet is that about 95% of them are up to no good.  Just my .02.

I suggest this infomration goes on a list of &quot;Known Vulnerabilities of ...&quot; e.g. of various softwares or even under the article of XP on Wikipedia rather than here. A title like &quot;How to Crack...&quot; might raise eyebrows and unwanted attention which could result in legal nuisances even though I agree the title is very effective.

Furthermore I believe that good universities or learning places should possess a degree of ethical code in order for their survival. Have you ever heard of a good University for becoming a thief. I agree that a police-man should know all the trix of he trade of a thief in order for him to do his job better but the book he will be given will never be called &quot;How to rob a 90 year old&quot; or &quot;Bank Robbery for dummies&quot; but rather e.g. &quot;Characteristics and Behaviour of Criminals&quot;. SDAM!

== I don't agree==
i knew about this but in a easier and faster way (no need to crack the password)
i think the article must be modified to give the parad to this too easy method
because this is a major security threat this needs to be known BUT with the associated parad:
crypt the hd:
on windows 2000/xp (nt series don't know if nt4 is concerned) there is an option in ntfs that permit to crypt folders and file so why not crypting theses SAM files (need to test it and to be able to restore it with bart-pe or another windows installation if the computer doesn't start)
so i think crypting the hdd is a solution but they may be some others

: Info like this is available in hundreds of hack sites etc - so whats one more ? However I guess moving this to make it part of a more comprehensive article/book  makes a lot of sense. [[User:59.92.131.39|59.92.131.39]] 07:11, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

::[[w:Security_through_obscurity | Security through Obscurity]] is widely argued to be an inadequate means of protection.  Fostering this paradigm is of little aid to the developers of products which run on Windows XP.  

::In fact, open source software (such as Linux) tends to be more secure that others (such MS Windows), because security holes can be proactively addressed.  (Note that when Microsoft patches a security vulnerability in their software, in most cases, that flaw has existed since release.  Flaws in an open source system can be addressed before vulnerability is discovered or “proof of concept” is exploited with malicious intent.

::I did not know of the importance of passwords greater than 14 characters.  This article has been of use to me; I will be updating my XP password.

== [[Reverse Engineering]] ==

I'm going to adapt some of this information for use as an example in the [[Reverse Engineering]] wikibook. I also recommend that this information be moved (in whole or in part) to the [[Cryptography]] book, or any of the Windows-related books on the computing bookshelf. This module cannot stand on it's own, but it probably won't fall under the VfD axe either (not yet anyway). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:50, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

:While I don't mind you moving this somewhere else, I don't see completely why it would fit in [[Reverse Engineering]].  This is more a tool for what some sort of PC technician would need to do system repairs.  That is why I advocated instead for something like [[PC Technicians Repairbook]] as the &quot;parent&quot; for this Wikibook module.  Reverse Engineering would be taking stuff from Ralf Brown's list and trying to make an operating system from those specifications and memory address descriptions.

:I don't know completely what should be done, and it can be moved again even after putting in the [[Reverse Engineering]] wikibook, so I guess it really doesn't matter too much.  I agree completely that it can't stay as an independent module.  The Reverse Engineering that needs to take place, IMHO, is to take the external web pages and reverse engineer those programs to explain in more detail the actual algorithm which is being used.  Some sample software should be listed as source code as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:37, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

::I only said that I was adapting ''some'' of the information as a case study in the reverse engineering book, because let's face it: cracking passwords is part of reverse engineering. However, i also specifically mention that the majority of this information should definately go to either the [[Cryptography]] book, or else one of the computing books about windows. I agree whole heartedly that we can probably move this page to the [[PC Technicians Repairbook]], or something similar. It did, however, make a valuable example for RE, so i'm also going to use it there as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:A simple vote to move or consolidate this information into a catagory or book that encompasses a realm it should fall under.  This should not stand alone. --[[User:MichaelMraz|MichaelMraz]]16:29, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== What the hell is a &quot;parad&quot;? ==

is this even a word? --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 05:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:I have to be honest, I have no idea what it could be. This page was merged wholesale from a stub book on the subject a long time ago, and clearly it hasn't been edited much since that time. If you can figure out what they are trying to say, you can go ahead and fix it. Otherwise, I am in favor of simply deleting the section entirely. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:21, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== Hash generation no longer &quot;computationally difficult&quot; ==
Opening sentence says: ''This page is about cracking (recovering) passwords on Windows XP machines, which is a '''computationally difficult process'''.'' 

See article [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/12/password_cracking_on_crack/ SSD tools crack passwords 100 times faster]; excerpt:&lt;br&gt;

Password-cracking tools optimised to work with SSDs have achieved speeds up to 100 times quicker than previously possible.

After optimising its rainbow tables of password hashes to make use of SSDs Swiss security firm Objectif Sécurité was able to crack 14-digit WinXP passwords with special characters &lt;u&gt;in just 5.3 seconds&lt;/u&gt;. Objectif Sécurité's Philippe Oechslin told Heise Security that the result was 100 times faster than possible with their old 8GB Rainbow Tables for XP hashes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''McDonaldization and Opposition to Rationalized Irrationality'''

''Our focus here is on the utilitarian organization, that which people go to for some type of reward, whether they're employees working for a paycheck or customers looking for products with the best value, quality, and consistency - or even students like us at universities. The idea behind “free markets”, chock full of this type of organization, is that we should have freedom to choose within and between them. Still, our degree of freedom in this choice is severely limited by the nature of the organizations dominating the market. We have seen the rise, fall, and rise again of huge corporations from the robber barons at the turn of the century to McDonalds and Wal-Mart today. The question remains: How can we simultaneously promote citizens' freedom to choose while optimizing production efficiency?''

•  There are a growing number of groups opposing the expansion of fast food restaurants and big box retailers

•  However, these are by no means the only organizations to be looking at, they are just the most visible today

•  The ideas behind these organizations is so widespread and popular because it is so effective - their tactics are drawn from highly rationalized economic decisions combined with marketing images playing on different individuals' conceptions of themselves and their needs – diverse, highly targeted, and well orchestrated

•  Some examples from popular media as well as from citizen groups fighting to keep them out of their cities:

- Fast Food Nation , How Wal-Mart is Ruining America , Super Size Me , Store Wars against Wal-Mart

- Voters across CA derailed Wal-Mart's planned 40 new superstores, notably in Inglewood April 2004

- Gainesville's city commission took similar action this year by refusing to grant Wal-Mart a supercenter

- In response to these threats, public relations within these companies has begun to try to favorably reshape their images

- McDonalds has added healthier foods to their menu and reportedly is phasing out their supersize option

- Wal-Mart's new customized propaganda brochures advertise their economic/environmental benefits

•  Still, it seems that these companies are underestimating the diversity of ideological angles the opposition may take - in fact, I submit to the reader that the opposition to these big, flashy, cultural icon companies are but easy initial targets, that is, early casualties of a quickly consolidating cultural/political aesthetic whose main characteristic is its anti-corporate ethics.

•  Let's listen to what the opposition is saying about the pitfalls of these large, highly efficient corporations, that is, the beast in general, because it will teach us lots about the nature of the organizational structure itself that you might not otherwise hear or think too much about…

- environmentally unsound = MDs large scale cattle ranching operations in the West is extremely destructive to topsoil; what's worse is that they are now exporting cattle operations to Brazil, particularly in cheap, recently deforested parts of the Amazon Basin; they also lots of genetically modified agricultural products (wheat/potatoes); both MDs and WM are major component implicated in suburban sprawl (destruction of farmland and countryside); WM sells lots of “cheap plastic crap”, generating more consumer purchases and quicker throw-away product turnover

- poor labor practices = most of MDs and WM employees are young, unskilled, economically/ethnically disadvantaged women. In fact, WM has recently been cited and fined several times for using undocumented illegal alien cleaning crews; they are also facing a class action lawsuit for sex discrimination in wage, benefits, and promotions. All these things help make their workforce cheaper and easier to control. These jobs are largely alienating and dehumanizing, more like industrial revolution style service jobs than the information age occupations the future is supposed to be offering. Unions are upset because MDs and WM blatantly violate state/federal labor laws and do everything in their power to keep their workers unorganized; employees have incredibly high turnover and most try to keep their employees at just below full time hours so they don't have to provide benefits; fast food is dangerous work due to high accident and violent crime rates (stickups); working conditions are even worse for MDs immigrant meatpackers and farmworkers in the Midwest who hold the most dangerous jobs in America. Even worse off are the people supplying WM with cheap goods - sweatshop workers in 19th century style factories throughout poor nations overseas.

- local/national concerns = big chains like MDs and WM are a huge threat to local businesses who often can't compete with companies that own their suppliers and thus can offer much cheaper prices at much higher profit margins; WM often breaks anti-trust laws by selling its products at priced illegally under wholesale value; most profits from WM and MDs franchises don't get recycled back into the local community as the case with small business owners, instead, they are put into the hands of far away executives/administrators and into chain expansion plans, something most small businesses never consider. The chains dominance erodes local sense of community and ownership. Also, it would seem that national interests aren't served by these companies who move operations and profits transnationally at will with little loyalty

- anti-corporate globalization = critics of these institutions are diverse including farmers, leftists, anarchists, local businesses, nationalists, consumer advocates, educators, health officials, labor rights activists, and animal rights activists are converging on this issue. MDs are the favorite target for destruction overseas when American policy turns unfavorable; people dislike the homogenization of their national culture and find America best to blame – WM will be next on the list as it is even bigger threat.

•  But still, these companies are highly efficient and convenient – fast, cheap, wide selection, consistent service... This is why we utilize them so much, because they seem very effective to us in the short run. However, when we make our basic purchasing decisions, we certainly aren't taking all the social costs (what economists call externalities) into account…

•  How can smaller operations without the “Fordist” method of production and distribution be able to compete? Do we want the smaller forms of business to simply fade away? Do we have any use for them anymore?

Consumers continue to demonstrate a passion for localized, decentralized niche products – this growing “anti-corporate” preference. This is not to say that the idea is so important or widespread that most consumers (even highly educated ones) even take such an idea into account in their purchasing decisions. However, when we look at other manifestations of consumer ethics that many of us are aware of, it becomes clear that these ideas hold at least a bit of the unified anti-corporate ethic within their rhetoric as well. Take for instance some most famous instances of consumer ethics distinctions…

Agricultural Products:

Vegetarian/vegan vs. meat and other animal related products

Factory Farmed vs. Small-Scale animal agriculture (local farmers and free range animals)

Organic foods vs. non-organic foods (Silk soymilk vs. Publix soymilk)

Healthy vs. Non-Healthy foods (high levels of fat, sugar, preservatives associated with big name brands)

Large Food Companies vs. local agricultural produce (Dole fruit vs. farmers' market fruit)

Fast food vs. Slow food (dinner on the go vs. cooking and eating homemade meals)

 

Labor Disputes:

Farmworker/Employee Strikes (Taco Bell tomato pickers/CA supermarkets Safeway and Ralph's strike)

Sweatshop vs. Non-Sweatshop Labor (Nike vs. Doc Marten)

Fair vs. Free Trade (coffee)

Foreign vs. Domestic (Japanese vs. American automobiles)

 

Other:

Animal testing vs. non-animal testing (alternative standards of ethics)

Fur vs. Synthetic

SUVs vs. compact vehicles (Explorer vs. Geo)

Local vs. Chain/Franchised Businesses (Mom &amp; Pop vs. Wal-Mart)

Corporate vs. Alternative Media (Network News vs. Indymedia or The Onion)

 

•  Will this anti-corporate movement be discredited and co-opted like the environmental and labor movements?

•  Maybe, but this is a different kind of movement, one that depends almost solely on people's decision to buy or not to buy…

•  There isn't anything particularly inevitable about the forms of utilitarian organizations today dominating the marketplace – sure, those who have the most resources already have the greatest advantage – but that doesn't give them the eternal scepter of power - creativity and worldly awareness has the power to change everything

•  In fact, one of the only ways these organizations have been sustained over the past few decades or so is through different government subsidies to these types of industries, starting with the construction of the interstate highway system that facilitated mass transit by auto and suburban sprawl and extending to generous tax cuts/exemptions given out to these companies by officials at different levels of government.

•  The point is that the free market doesn't really reflect the true, unadulterated nature of customer demand… it never has and it probably never will – so the inevitability argument falls flat on its face – there are more dimensions to consumer choice besides supply/demand and more people are taking them into account

•  The primary question that liberal democracies like our own have been charged with answering for the last two centuries is how to balance the efficiency and amorality of market tendencies – but they will only see fit to do it if there is pressure placed on them by citizen consumers who are serious about change

•  This question has historically been left up to the appropriate governmental authorities (congress more or less) but don't expect them to come to the rescue to set things right anytime soon – their constituencies are fairly well distracted at the moment with other (mostly irrational) fears they see on TV. As long as this keeps us entertained, the biggest special interest lobbies in world history will still hold unopposed sway.

•  Ask yourself: what is your viable alternative to the McDonaldization and “Wal-Mart-ization” of our world?

•  Keep in mind that these organizations, just like the ones you are planning, sell lifestyles these days… that's how image is crafted and sold – all you need to know is how you and a significant number of people around you want to live… and of course, how you all want to be perceived by others… craft your representations wisely...

[[Principles of Sociology/PARECON]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;The Fix is In&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/168.ram]... Yes, airline prices are always the same no matter which airline you call; in Presidential elections you always feel like you're choosing between the lesser of two evils; and it doesn't really make your hair any cleaner if do the &quot;repeat&quot; part of the instructions &quot;shampoo, rinse, repeat.&quot; There are all sorts of situations in which we suspect the fix is in, but we almost never find out for certain. On today's show, for once, we find out. The whole program is devoted to one story, in which we go inside the back rooms of one multinational corporation and hear the intricate workings recorded on tape of how they put the fix in. We hear from Kurt Eichenwald, whose book The Informant is about the price fixing conspiracy at the food company Archer Daniels Midland, and the executive who cooperated with the FBI in recording over 250 hours of secret video and audio tapes, probably the most remarkable videotapes ever made of an American company in the middle of a criminal act.
Prologue. Ira speaks with two people who believe they've uncovered behind- the-scenes conspiracies but can't be sure. Attorney Andy Hail has sued the two biggest supermarkets in Chicago (Dominick's and Jewel) because they charge a dollar more for milk than stores around the country, and because their prices seem to change simulateously, as if orchestrated. Cindi Canary from the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform tells the story of an Illinois law that seems to mostly benefit one man--the man who made sure it made it though the legislature. 
Act One. We hear the first part of our story about Archer Daniels Midland and FBI informant Mark Whitacre. In this half, Whitacre inadvertantly ends up a cooperating witness, and turns himself into one of the best cooperating witnesses in the history of U.S. law enforcement, gathering evidence with an adeptness few have matched. (25 minutes)
Act Two. Our story about ADM and Mark Whitacre continues. The FBI finds out that their star cooperating witness Mark Whitacre has been lying to them for three years about some rather serious matters.

''We often hear about “the economy” and the important factors involved in its fluctuations that most of the public doesn't conceptually grasp, but it isn't very often that we talk about our underlying economic principles. This is because most of us unknowingly embrace the TINA principle – there is no alternative – when we cannot think or conceive of economies significantly different than our own. The traditional capitalist/communist debate has been all but settled, but still, many citizens living in the world's premiere capitalist nations feel at best ambivalent about the seemingly negative [side]effects stemming from our particular economic organization – gross inequality on local, national, and international level, ecological degradation, commodification of sacred institutions, poor job environments, cultural homogenization, etc. We should remember that no particular economic model is the natural destiny of humankind. Economies are socially constructed and correspond to specific cultural/political dynamics - they can be reorganized.''

'''Conceptual Definitions of Economic Processes:'''

Economy = a system for producing, distributing, and consuming goods and services (wealth)

Allocation = deciding who produces how much of what, the price of exchanges, and how to distribute it

Ownership Relations = who can own the means of production – private individuals, the state, cooperatives

Division of Labor = deciding who should have what kind of job with what kind of decision making power

Decision Making = how economic relations are organized by actors and institutions

Remuneration = the process of deciding who deserves how much compensation for their labor

'''Different Kinds of Economies:'''

Capitalist : private ownership of the means of production, hierarchical corporate division of labor, central gov't planning and semi-centralized decision making, and remuneration based on market performance

State Socialist : state ownership of the means of production, corporate division of labor, centralized government economic planning by the coordinator class, and remuneration based on power/output

Market Socialist : mixed state/private ownership of production sites, market/centralized division of labor, central planning and semi-centralized decision making, market/coordinator class control of remuneration

Bioregionalist : public ownership of the means of production, decentralized exchange and cooperation guides division of labor and decision making, the central organizing goal is environmental sustainability

Participatory : public/socially relevant ownership, balanced job combinations guiding the division of labor, workers councils utilizing participatory planning organize economic decision making, and remuneration is based upon effort and sacrifice with the principles below serving as overarching guidelines

'''Judging the Effects of Past and Current Economic Institutions on Societies'''

Market Economies – the raw fact that the desires of workers and capitalists are so often diametrically opposed leads to exploitation and conflict. This competition for scarce resources manifests in sometimes vicious strife among different classes of workers inside a company (management, unions) and different groups outside the company who would like to have the jobs themselves (poorer foreign workers). Powerful coalitions of capitalists have been known to collude to manipulate public desires and political beliefs in order to enrich their own interests. Furthermore, the constant need for economic growth comes at the expense of public health and well being, especially when overconsumption damages the environment.

Command Economies – the central planning of communist nations has almost unequivocally failed on all similar measures, but open conflict remains more veiled in authoritarian political regimes. Often, the basic needs of the people were not met because the planners became an oppressive ruling class of their own who deprived the people to enhance their own power. The plans that came down on workers from the central gov't did not reflect the actual situation in the factory and were horribly inefficient. The process of allocation became more and more corrupt, exploitative, and alienating – mirroring the political system.

'''Principles of Participatory Economics:'''

Equity – How to decide what people deserve to be remunerated in the economy? Different norms exist…

Norm 1 = according to the contribution of a person's physical (property) and human (skills) assets

Norm 2 = according to the contribution of a person's human assets only

Norm 3 = according to a person's effort or personal sacrifice only

Norm 4 = according to a person's needs only

Self-Management – Who should get to decide how economic matters should be handled?

Norm 1 = give the lion's share of decision making power to the few “strongest” or “most able”

Norm 2 = give everyone participating an equal say in decision making – majority rule style

Norm 3 = vary the distribution of power in decision making based on how much one is affected

Diversity – Homogenization of life conditions, material outcomes, culture, and thought pattern is dangerous because it increases the risk of cascading catastrophe – innovative diversity thus represents security

Solidarity – Competition and cooperation shouldn't be conceptualized as mutually exclusive. We should encourage both, but seek to do so in a way that doesn't promote either stifling the other's potential.

Efficiency – Economic institutions must efficiently meet the expressed needs of the population they serve

'''The Particulars of PARECON Vision:'''

Socially Relevant Ownership – no one may own the means of production because everyone owns a fractional part proportionate to its affects on their life… the means of production have traditionally been defined as large scale land, capital, and machinery that is used to produce goods for economic exchange… thus this doesn't affect what one may own for their personal use value or small scale economic exchanges

Nested Economic Councils – worker and consumer councils of different scales (family, workplace, neighborhood, city, county, state, nation, etc.) will decide what needs to be produced and how to go about getting it done in the best possible way. Decision making procedures and communication methods would vary according to the nature of the task at hand and the potential effects on other worker/consumers

Balanced Job Complexes – the human costs and benefits of work must be equally distributed so that job complexes balance what workers define as more or less empowering/fulfilling tasks. People will have the ability to change their job complexes and acquire new skills to access new jobs as they desire so long as their job complex remains balanced overall and there are not dangerous losses in overall productivity.

Remuneration – Workers will be paid based on the personal effort and sacrifice they demonstrate in their work. This means that individuals should not be rewarded based on their productive output, bargaining power, or innate talent. Remuneration is based on how well they contribute utilizing their own abilities. Under these conditions, Mozart, Bill Gates, and a man disabled in a car crash should receive at least somewhat similar formal compensation for similar effort/sacrifice at a different quality/level of production.

Allocation – citizens must be able to effectively weigh the individual and social cost/benefit consequences of certain strategies of production/consumption to successfully guide the economy. Supply and demand data needed to coordinate the effort would be generated by worker and consumer councils and collated into overall plans for larger economic units. The feasibility of balancing these requests would be analyzed and the results sent back to the councils for revision in an iterative fashion, eventually producing viable plans.

'''Some Criticisms:'''

Inefficiency/Lack of Incentives – if everyone is rewarded similarly (in consumption) for similar effort, why would anyone work hard? Wouldn't collective laziness thereby reduce efficiency and productivity?

Stifling Talent/Quality/Innovation – how would PARECON reward people with special talents that don't fit neatly into the balanced job complex like artists and inventors – would it limit or distort their creations?

Planning Compromises Individual Freedom/Privacy – one cannot escape the social pressure to participate in a PARECON… thus one cannot escape making one's views and needs known in a very public forum

Adjustment Issues – could PARECON adjust for changes in consumer needs as quickly and efficiently as markets? ex. technological innovation forces drastic remodeling or a massive tsunami hits the coastline

Negotiation of Needs – will individuals or groups be able to push for whatever needs they feel need fulfillment or will group pressure dictate exactly what are acceptable needs? ex. swimming pools, cigarettes

Compatibility – would PARECON be compatible with other core social institutions in our society or would drastically change our culture by bending things like religion, nationalism, or gender relations to its will?

Other Concerns – Wouldn't PARECON just lead to group formations and sectarian conflict? Doesn't it contradict what we know about “human nature”? Wouldn't capitalist markets just crush it from the start?

 

Just about all the public discussion and debate about PARECON can be found in the links at http://www.zmag.org/parecon/indexnew.htm

 

For economics buffs looking for a bit more scientific treatment of the PARECON theories compared with those utilized in market economies and centrally planned economies, http://www.zmag.org/books/5.htm provides a formal mathematical model that supposedly (though I don't claim to understand enough to evaluate them) demonstrates its superior convergence, efficiency, and stability properties.

:::* To calculate the '''resting heart rate''' (RHR), the individual should remain in a resting position either sitting or lying down.

Example: The same individual as above sits and rests with eyes closed for about ten minutes afterwards that individual takes a pulse for 15 seconds. This person then multiplys 4 to the count obtained. The result is the RHR. Assume for the following examples that the individuals RHR is 70.
:::* To calculate the '''heart rate reserve''' (HRR) Subtract the RHR from MHR. Example: The individual's HRR is 121. ''191 - 70''
::* '''Calculating Lower and Upper Target Heart Rates using MHR and HRR methods. ''These two methods may lead to different results.'''''
:::* Using Maximal Heart Rate: The '''lower limit''' = MHR * 0.55 and the '''upper limit''' = MHR * 0.90. Example: MHR = 191; 191 * 0.55 = 105; 191 * 0.9 = 172; so the target zone is 105 - 172.
:::* Using Heart Rate Reserve: The '''lower limit''' = (HRR * 0.4) + RHR and the '''upper limit''' = (HRR * 0.85) + RHR. Example: HRR = 121; RHR = 70; lower limit = (121 * 0.4) + 70 = 118 and the upper limit = (121 * 0.85) + 70 = 173; so the target zone is 118-173.</text>

== Probability ==
{{prerequisite|Probability}}

This section of the [[Signals and Systems]] book will be talking about probability, random signals, and noise. This book will not, however, attempt to teach the basics of probability, because there are dozens of resources (both on the internet at large, and on Wikipedia mathematics bookshelf) for probability and statistics. This book will assume a basic knowledge of probability, and will work to explain random phenomena in the context of an Electrical Engineering book on signals..

== Random Variable ==
A random variable is a quantity whose value is not fixed but depends somehow on chance. Typically the value of a random variable may consist of a fixed part and a random component due to uncertainty or disturbance. Other types of random variables takes their values as a result of the outcome of a random experiment.

Random variables are usually denoted with a capital letter. For instance, a generic random variable that we will use often is ''X''. The capital letter represents the random variable itself and the corresponding lower-case letter (in this case &quot;''x''&quot;) will be used to denote the observed value of ''X''. ''x'' is one particular value of the process ''X''.

== Mean ==

The mean or more precise the expected value of a random variable is the central value of the random value, or the average of the observed values in the long run. We denote the mean of a signal ''x'' as &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. We will discuss the precise definition of the mean in the next chapter.

== Standard Deviation ==

The standard deviation of a signal ''x'', denoted by the symbol &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; serves as a measure of how much deviation from the mean the signal demonstrates. For instance, if the standard deviation is small, most values of ''x'' are close to the mean. If the standard deviation is large, the values are more spread out. 

The standard deviation is an easy concept to understand, but in practice it's not a quantity that is easy to compute directly, nor is it useful in calculations. However, the standard deviation is related to a more useful quantity, the '''variance'''.

== Variance ==

The variance is the square of the standard deviation and is more of theoretical importance. We denote the variance of a signal ''x'' as &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We will discuss the variance and how it is calculated in the next chapter.

== Probability Function ==

The probability function ''P'' is the probability that a certain event will occur. It is calculated based on the '''probability density function''' and '''cumulative distribution function''', described below.

We can use the ''P'' operator in a variety of ways:

:&lt;math&gt;P[\mbox{A coin is heads}] = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P[\mbox{A dice shows a 3}] = \frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability Density Function ==
The Probability Density Function (PDF) of a random variable is a description of the distribution of the values of the random variable. By integrating this function over a particular range, we can find the probability that the random variable takes on a value in that interval. The integral of this function over all possible values is 1.

We denote the density function of a signal ''x'' as ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. The probability of an event ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will occur is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;P[x_i] = f_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

== Cumulative Distribution Function ==

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a random variable describes the probability of observing a value at or below a certain threshold. A CDF function will be nondecreasing with the properties that the value of the CDF at negative infinity is zero, and the value of the CDF at positive infinity is 1.

We denote the CDF of a function with a capital F. The CDF of a signal ''x'' will have the subscript ''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''.

We can say that the probability of an event occurring less then or equal to ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined in terms of the CDF as:

:&lt;math&gt;P[x \le x_i] = F_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, we can define the probability that an event occurs that is greater then ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;P[x &gt; x_i] = 1 - F_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Or, the probability that an event occurs that is greater then or equal to ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;P[x \ge x_i] = 1 - F_x(x_i) + f_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation with PDF ===

The CDF and PDF are related to one another by a simple integral relation:

:&lt;math&gt;F_x(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_x(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_x(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F_x(x)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Terminology ===

Several book sources refer to the CDF as the &quot;Probability Distribution Function&quot;, with the acronym PDF. To avoid the ambiguity of having both the distribution function and the density function with the same acronym (PDF), some books will refer to the density function as &quot;pdf&quot; (lower case) and the distribution function as &quot;PDF&quot; upper case. To avoid this ambiguity, this book will refer to the distribution function as the CDF, and the density function as the PDF.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''“Social Perspectives on New Age Religion/Spirituality”'''

''It is difficult to have a productive discussion about religion and spirituality if the conversation doesn't get beyond what people consider the fundamental realm of faith, that is, the more unquestionable nature of religion. However, it is important to consider what social forces influence people's experience inside a specific religious context or organization and the consequences these behaviors have on shaping society at large. Discussing the emergence of “new age” religious practices helps us get beyond most people's hang ups regarding their religious commitments and provides us an interesting new arena to thoughtfully explore.''

What is the meaning of “New Age”? (ideas)

How does a person labeled “New Age” behave? (behaviors)

How many people actually engage in New Age activities? (statistics)

Is there a New Age social movement or just a trend? (ideology and growth dynamics)

Most monotheistic religions have mystical aspects, or sects within the larger body…

Judaism – Kabbalah Islam – Sufism and Whirling Dervishes Christianity – Chanting Monastic Meditation

More polytheistic faiths like Hinduism, Buddhism, and animism tend to incorporate mysticism throughout

The New Age turn in America is not part of a consolidated religious sect (like the Hare Krishnas) nor a more mainstream cult (like the Moonies). New Age is better described as a large and diverse subcultural realm.

New Age spirituality and religious philosophy as we conceive of it today should be considered a distinctly American phenomenon, perhaps even part of our larger ethnicity. Our country has a long history of religious experimentalism and fundamentalist revival stretching back to the 17 th century. The New Age has captivated people much like the Spiritualists, Transcendentalists, and Theosophists did in the past.

This large-scale, fragmented, decentralized religious subculture drew its principal inspiration from sources outside of the Judeo-Christian tradition, mostly eastern religions and philosophies. While it was in many respects a continuation of a preexisting occult-metaphysical tradition, the addition to its ranks of a sizable number of former counterculturists from the 1950s period onward meant that New Age was no longer a marginal phenomenon: by the eighties, it had become an integral part of a new, truly pluralistic mainstream.

There are lots of interesting groups that have incorporated New Age beliefs and techniques into their repertoire. Before the dot com bubble burst, seminar spirituality had become widespread across the corporate landscape, encouraging creativity and personal growth in business management. Even the army has taken on some aspects: “Be All That You Can Be” and Delta Force uses New Age training exercises

Some people will tell you that the New Age movement has been siphoning off followers of mainstream Christian and Jewish denominations. People have been predicting the decline of traditional religious faiths for more than a century now, but statistics show it still hasn't come to pass. What is more likely to be happening is that while people continue to practice their inherited faith, they take on other New Age practices as well on the side and use them in a complementary fashion when their religion falls short…

Observers have noticed a general rise in spirituality over the last 50 years or so. This can be evidenced by the rise in New Age beliefs, the revival of ancient indigenous spiritualism, and the rebirth of Charismatic Christian churches across the churches constantly invoking the Holy Spirit in their congregation. Max Weber might insist that this “re-enchantment” of the world is a response to the increasing power of science and predicable rationality. Also, the sheer amount of choice people have in spirituality might also play a role

The baby boom generation is said to have taken on the New Age ideology most readily. Why might that be?

What might explain why so many Jews embrace New Age practices and their roots in eastern philosophy?

Can you see any links between the rise in New Age spirituality and the rise of more fundamentalist faiths?

'''Traits of the New Age:'''

•  an attitude of &quot;epistemological individualism,&quot; that is, a belief that the individual is the ultimate locus for the determination of truth.

•  an attitude of &quot;revelational indeterminacy,&quot; that is, a belief that the truth may be revealed in diverse ways and through diverse agents. No individual or organization possesses a monopoly on the truth.

•  New Age is more about transformation than about prediction (astrology) – as such, it changes its focus constantly. It can only be defined by its primal experience of transformation. New Agers have either experienced or are diligently seeking a profound personal transformation from an old, unacceptable life to a new, exciting future....

•  Those who have experienced a personal transformation project the possibility of the transformation not of just a number of additional individuals, but of the culture and of humanity itself.

•  There is always an emphasis on healing, whether physical, mental, or spiritually oriented - it can come from within or from direct encounters with a guru

'''Similar Traits in Religious Fundamentalism:'''

•  Personal transformation (salvation) and direct spiritual experience (communion) are at the heart of one's life project - private transformation must find its twin in the transformation of society.

•  Fundamentalists hear voices more than see visions: their mysticism comes clad in a rhetoric of newness that is expressed as ongoing revelation in their day to day decision making.

•  Fundamentalists stress healing, either through charismatic preachers (the anointed) or mass prayer.... physical health is a sign of blessing, part of the empowerment that comes through close contact with what is sacred. Another sign of blessing is material prosperity.

•  Both tend to take texts and revelations quite literally (religious materialism)

•  Both have a populist, non-elite, volunteer-oriented notion of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; salvation

'''Some Ways to Identify These Types of Social Movements:'''

•  Sense of belonging – A large number of persons unequivocally identifying with some group or idea

•  Common values – values and practices that everyone must try to live up to in order to bring the vision to fruition in the world

•  Goals of the movement – attempting to create an alternative society that they believe will eventually supplant mainstream society.

•  Common Style— a way of appearing and behaving on a daily basis to give aesthetic continuity to the movement as a whole – in these groups it is often anti-materialistic simplicity.

•  Jargon – there is a discourse within the movement that outsiders have difficulty understanding.

•  Mass communication – there are a large number of alternative sources of information, such as newsletters and magazines, which circulate news within the movement and which rarely appeal to people outside of the movement.

Do people get the same kinds of things from New Age practices as they do from more mainstream religions?

What types of people do you think have a tendency to adopt New Age behaviors and ways of thinking?

How might the New Age movement and the bobo mentality we discussed earlier overlap? Why?

Healing = spiritual growth/learning

What does the term “new Age convey” – this debate is what spawned my interest in doing this presentation – it is the distinction between faddish caricatures and actual measurements of widespread behaviors. You can't just ask someone if they are new age.

Is New Age a social movement? Not in the traditional sense, but it is a number of groups and individuals that have a number of beliefs and orientations that have what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has called a 'family resemblance'—two members of the family may bear almost no resemblance to each other, although they both resemble a third member

Yoga, meditation, homeopathy, eastern religious philosophy, crystals, holistic medicine, natural food, eco-awareness

Because of its diverse and decentralized nature, new age practices have infiltrated many traditional people's lives –Jews, Christians, businessmen, and doctors alike

A significant proportion, if not a majority of those people embracing new age spirituality and philosophy are from the Baby Boom generation – those hippies and counterculturalists who embarked on various types of spiritual quests in the decades following the 1960s. This is associated with a relative turn inwards of American culture – brought on by the onset of vast individualistic consumerism, youth subcultures, and an overall breakdown in value congruency.

New age is largely an emphasis on the self with concomitant emphasis on novel experience.

How many people are “new agers” in one sense or another of holding alternative religious views?

This is very hard to tell and it certainly depends on what part of the country you look in… i.e. San Francisco has more new agers than Omaha for sure. It is difficult to get good numbers on the population mostly because quantitative sociologists aren't so interested in collecting statistics to study this group – qualitative researchers have more fun just talking to a select few of these folks.

Labeling problems and recognizing shortcomings and needlessness of labels. In a recent edition of Body Mind Spirit , one of the more widely distributed New Age magazines, the editor, Paul Zuromski, raises the question, &quot;Is 'New Age' Dead?&quot; This question is asked in the context of a short piece on the editor's page which explains why the magazine has dropped its banner &quot;Your New Age Information Resource&quot; in favor of &quot;Tools for Creating a Richer, More Fulfilling Life.&quot; After asserting that he never cared much for the New Age label anyway, the editor proceeds to cite Gallup Poll findings, as well as certain other evidence, which indicate that the label has acquired negative connotations in the mind of the general public. Partially because of this negative press, even book publishers are abandoning the new age category for a series of &quot;more accurate labels like self-help, new science, metaphysics, Eastern religions, philosophy, natural living,&quot; and so forth

Link between Christian fundamentalism and New Age - In viewing the New Age as an expression of American culture, Bednaroski is drawing on Catherine Albanese's work on the New Age. Albanese puts forward a broad interpretation of the significance of the New Age in &quot;Religion and the American Experience.&quot; 17 In this article, she argues that

Think about how Max Weber's notions of disenchantment and reenchantment line up with new age ideas about energy, animism, also see new Christian revivals and the emphasis on the spirit

Think about the ever precence of charlatans, pop-mysticism, and disingenuous or counterfeit spirituality

Think about the role of the charismatic leader/teacher in these movements – the oracle, seer, shaman, prophet

There are reportedly 300,000 witches and neopagans worldwide

Why do Jews overrepresent themselves in New Age organizations as compared to their portion of the population?

What kind of people adopt New Age practices and spiritual beliefs?

How do people become New Age?  hint – it isn't TV

Are New Agers accepting of other social outcasts – gays, awkward teenage girls, etc?

What is the overt connection between mysticism and the New Age movement?

What is their stance on environmental issues and how might it be related to animism and belief in reviving tribal religions?

Think about the difference between New Age groups and formal religious organizations (like churches) in the way of social services provided, and community in the spatial sense of a meeting house

'''Here is an example of New Age discourse at a corporate training session:'''

&quot;We look within to find our own individual self and universal source. That source has been called the Inner Self, the hidden mind, the divine spark, the Divine Ego, the Great I Am, God, and Essence. Some say that the very purpose of human existence is to get acquainted with your own essential qualities and express them in your daily activities. Whether it is the purpose of life or not, it is a fine definition of personal creativity: living every moment from your essence.&quot;

The above passage is not quoted from a book on metaphysics, Eastern philosophy, or one authored by Shirley MacLaine. It is from Creativity in Business, written by Michael Ray, a professor at Stanford Business School  1 Ray has taught a course of the same name for several years. Its purpose is to teach students how to use New Age metaphysical teachings to increase their creativity in a business setting. The contents of the book include meditation techniques, yoga exercises, and even specific instructions on how to contact a personal &quot;Spirit Guide.&quot;2 “human potential” seminars

Creativity in Business is a clear example of how the American business community is becoming more and more receptive to New Age practices when used to increase productivity and efficiency. In July of 1986 officials from IBM, AT&amp;T, and General Motors met in New Mexico to discuss how metaphysics, the occult, and Hindu mysticism could possibly aid businessmen in an increasingly competitive marketplace.3

Even the U.S. Army has joined in. The slogan &quot;Be All You Can Be&quot; is a direct result of a commission established to explore the possibility of creating a &quot;New Age Army.&quot;4 Interest in New Age training methods became so significant in the armed services that in 1984 a project was undertaken by the National Research Council which would investigate these phenomena in detail. Their final report, published in 1988, concluded

[[Principles of Sociology/Radical Center Initiatives]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Harold&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/84.ram]... A parable of politics and race in America.
Act One. Yesterday. A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, and its lessons for black and white America, as told by people close to him. Many of them are activists and politicians, some are people from his administration, some are reporters who followed his story, a few are ordinary voters, and one was a political opponent of the late mayor.
Act Two. The present and the future. Thoughts about why there are no black mayors in the nation's largest cities today--New York, Los Angeles, Chicago. Plus a visit to a white Chicago ward, to see if ordinary voters have learned any tolerance in the last ten years since Washington's death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The discussion below is based on '''The Radical Center: the Future of American Politics''' by Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, both fellows at the New America Foundation (www.newamerica.net), an influential non-partisan public policy institute

''For the first time in American history, a majority of the eligible voting population identify as independents, aligning with neither of the two major parties or any of the other available partisan options. Even in an election that is as controversial and allegedly historically significant as this one, most voters seem disgusted with both the Democratic and Republican parties and the candidates they have nominated for our highest political office. Only around half of this population regularly turns out to vote in presidential elections. This electoral “de-alignment” shows that no political entity in our nation has had the capacity to unite a majority of citizens in a lasting coalition for quite some time now. Instead, we have a “duopoly” of two antiquated, constantly feuding, and largely un-compelling giants. These two beasts have been captured by extreme special interest groups within their party ranks and thus are unable to articulate a vision that might motivate the majority of citizens to take an active part in the political process; not just to vote for the “lesser evil”. Between infighting and constant skirmishing with the other big party, neither has the ability to carry out necessary information age reforms of our antique social contracts. In such a climate, what direction do politics in America need to move in order to address the search for new, innovative solutions to our most pressing and seemingly intractable social problems''?

'''Domestic Problems Facing America Today''' : Social Security insecurity, disproportionate aging of the population, immigration-induced economic effects, health insurance, poor public education in primary and secondary schools, income inequality, two-party stagnation

'''Broad Ideas of the Radical Centrist Agenda :'''

•  Information Age America is distinctly different from our last great historical era, New Deal America , though most of our social institutions remain holdovers from that period and its predecessors (like Reconstruction America)

•  Our public philosophy hasn't changed much - freedom to enrich oneself through hard work, freedom from oppression and destitution, freedom of public/private association - but our material realities have, so we must change our social infrastructure

•  New technologies have brought us the potential of yet greater freedoms, but we must have both expanded choice and security to fully explore them, thus we must give our citizens greater choice – in voting, education, medicine, and their careers – however, a society will resist innovation so long as it is unable to implement means to mitigate the painful transition period

'''Economic Innovation Demands Social Innovation :'''

•  Creative destruction is increasing at a startling pace because our economic productivity requires constant innovation

•  Workers need to be able to change jobs without devastating lapses in income or insurance; without a security net to ensure these basic needs, voters will pressure politicians to safeguard outmoded jobs and industries, thus stagnating innovation

•  An Information Age social contract must link all benefits to individuals rather than to employers or intermediate institutions

•  More jobs are short-term because less employers want to offer insurance benefits, which are fiscal and administrative hassles

•  Less and less of the population has adequate health insurance, this is especially concentrated amongst lower income groups

•  A single-payer universal health care system like all other industrialized nations use has some disadvantages as an alternative – necessary rationing, killing the private insurance industry, and the lack of a private medicine market would retard innovation

•  Instead, like we do with automobiles, make a basic private insurance plan mandatory for all who can afford it and provide government subsidization for the most needy who cannot – rich citizens could still purchase private “luxury” insurance plans

'''Social Security Reforms:'''

•  Demographic forces in the baby-boom generation and medical technology (contraception/longevity) threaten social security

•  The existing pay-as-you-go intergenerational transfer model is unsustainable in a slowly growing population

•  Why would we want to continue to risk a trade-off between fiscally burdening our working generation and endangering the health and overall well-being of our aging citizens?

•  So, like the newly proposed citizen-based insurance savings model, perhaps we should make similar moves in social security

•  This is also a compelling idea because for the first time since the Great Depression, we have a negative national savings rate.

•  Our politicians have been encouraging consumption (through the tax code and social security) for the past 60 years to buoy our manufacturing economy and trade relationships, but this occurred in an era of increasing media encouragement as well

•  Unless a cultural shift occurs in fiscal responsibility, a large number of future retirees will be dependent of the public purse

•  Since it seems Americans need help to accumulate adequate retirement funds, perhaps we should institute a mandatory 5% savings rate as well… social security already takes out 6% and employers match that for 12% total… if the mandatory retirement and insurance payments were taken out of this portion, it would still leave more to subsidize low-income earners

•  Furthermore, people would be able to play around with how to invest this money, so long as it isn't too risky

•  Finally, it wouldn't be a bad idea to move back the retirement/payout ages to compensate for increased longevity patterns

'''Enfranchising All Citizens in the New Economy :'''

•  The United States has had many historical programs to broaden capital ownership – the Homestead Act after the Civil War and the GI Bill after WWII for example – but it has been a while since the last manifestation

•  People are likely to become better citizens the more they have a stake in different social institutions – economic, political, etc.

•  Still, our society maintains privileged groups in both these interconnected spheres… “Capitalism isn't designed to create capitalists, but to finance capital. Absent political will, these dramatically different goals will not be reconciled.”

•  Perhaps we should make a point of giving children a financial nest egg at birth to give them a chance to finance a trial of their own innovative ideas in the marketplace. Call it “universal capitalism”. $5000 at birth would yield about $20000 at maturity.

•  Even if most children don't use this money to capitalize an idea, it would give children with not a whole lot else going for them a better shot of catching up with the larger trust fund babies – at only about $20 billion cost to the public

•  Furthermore, the money need not go to people who are already advantaged, it would be “means-tested” to avoid such waste.

'''Maximizing Choice at the Ballot Box :'''

•  Our election system limits races to two main parties by design, not by tradition or any kind of will by the people.

•  Plurality voting is the main reason that Clinton won in 1992 and Bush won in 2000 - Perot in 1992 siphoned off enough third-party but otherwise conservative votes to cause Bush Sr. to lose - Nader did the same thing to Gore in 2000 with liberal votes

•  This is a perversion of the public will (all half of it) in deciding elected offices, but is also a reinforcer for the two party system, because any time you vote for another party or candidate, you're more likely to be a spoiler than to effect change

•  Instant runoff or rank order voting consists of listing one's preferences in order (say 1 to 5) as to which candidates you favor more than others – thus, if no candidate wins a first choice majority of the votes, the secondary votes would be counted until one candidate achieves a majority by this route. However, you can see how the electoral college interferes in the presidency.

•  This would encourage the emergence of serious third parties and candidates to run and voters to take them fully into account at the ballot box, while ensuring that no fringe or extremist parties could win with only a small percentage of the vote.

•  Also, it would ensure that parties are represented in the government more in proportion to their actual strength in the electorate. It wouldn't cause the instability of multiparty parliaments in other countries because our executive branch is independent of the legislature and our representatives are elected by different shapes and sizes of constituencies.

•  Furthermore, like Maine and Nebraska , at least the electoral votes allotted to the state could be divided by the popular vote

'''The Simple Consumption Tax :'''

•  Information age tax systems should be as simple, equitable, transparent, and efficient as possible. Our national tax code is 10,000 pages long and trained professionals have trouble fully comprehending it. State sales taxes are even more complicated and regressive, people earning $750,000 pay 1% of their income sales tax annually, people making $15,000 pay 7%.

•  E-commerce is proving the state sales tax system even more arcane, as products bought in other states are often exempted, the current moratorium on Internet taxes is already hurting state incomes (much of which goes education), but will only get worse

•  Instead, instituting a national consumption tax whose proceeds are rebated to the states on a per capita basis could simplify the entire process and help poorer people simply by exempting $15,000 worth of essentials - housing, food, transportation

•  After income taxes, say you make $50,000 annually, if you saved $10,000 and subtracted the $15,000 basic allotment, your taxable consumption would be $25,000, at 10%, it would be $2,500 you end up paying in consumption tax

•  This progressive tax system would raise the same amount of money as the current patchwork of complex state and local taxes

•  The rich would pay more, and education since it is considered a public virtue in the information economy, would be exempted

•  While we're at it, we might as well move the same direction with the income tax code, eliminating most of the possible deductions from the income tax code that disproportionately benefit the well-to-do and salvage just middle class necessities

•  Furthermore, corporate taxes should be eliminated in order to not encourage companies to look for overseas tax-shelters to move their headquarters and to not to force states to compete amongst themselves to offer the best tax breaks. Instead of corporate taxes, the burden should be shifted to the wealthy individuals themselves and their passive, high-profit assets

'''Education Finance Reform :'''

•  Schools are still financed the same way as they were in the agricultural era – through local property taxes and state sales tax. This means that schools in districts with lower valued properties overall have less money to work with – the same is true of inner city schools which additionally often have lots of government-owned tax-exempt properties in their vicinity.

•  We hear a lot of debate about federal initiatives to reform our struggling K-12 schools in this countries (top notch politicians bank on this), but to a large extent this is totally disingenuous because of the tiny role the federal government actually plays in bringing about greater financial parity between vastly unequally funded schools (about 7% of school funding is federal)

•  To get serious about this problem, it seems we must talk about ways to equalize per capita student funding brought about on a national basis – not at a state level – Mississippi spends $4,000 per student while New Jersey spends $10,000, even after adjusting for standard of living disparities are controlled for – not at a county level – disparities are sometimes even larger

•  These differences translate into lower teacher salary (lower quality instructors), larger class sizes, and inferior facilities

•  Some state supreme courts like California and Vermont have stated that this funding system violates the equal protection clause, “The distribution of a resource as precious as educational opportunity should not have as its determining force the mere fortuity of a child's residence.” Almost all states have been sued on this basis and this has led to some picking up more of the funding ticket than the local school districts themselves, but has not fully addressed the issue by any means.

•  Worse still, it is often that affluent home owners or older residents without children refuse to increase property taxes

•  How can we apply national standards to education or assessing all students on standardized tests with these gross disparities?

•  Proceeds from a national consumption tax should be allotted to states on a per pupil basis, adjusting for different cost of living

'''Our Greatest National Challenges:'''

•  Spatial and geographic divides based on race, class, and age

•  We have become increasingly segregated in each of these respects

•  The cultural and political difference between these groups have become wider as well

•  It seems that these different groups have increasingly oppositional agendas and identities

•  A successful vision for improving the nation must address how to bring these social factions together

•  Finally, watch out for the capacity of expanded technological power to change our society further; namely genetics
